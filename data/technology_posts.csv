technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Yep, we are fully in the Slop era. (Slop is the catch-all term for AI-generated text and images.) It's a shame because, as a user, there's not a whole lot you can do when you see it, other than report it or mark it as spam. But that's exhausting, and there's a strong ethical argument to be made that the responsibility of policing AI slop online should not fall to us, the users. Similarly, the way to instill trust among users is for the platforms (Google, Meta, etc) to show us that they are taking the slop problem seriously by being proactive and taking clear, visible actions to keep it from spreading. If they show us that they are working hard to minimize it, then maybe that will level up the trust. —Michael Calore",3
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Hey! I'm going to give this a stab but Zoe is our brand-new director of our business coverage here at WIRED and she definitely has some thoughts too.

A lot of our stories these days come from our own idea generation, enterprise reporting (that's not in the enterprise software sense; that's us being enterprising), or from trusted sources telling us what's going on in the industry. 

Very rarely does a PR pitch come through that results in a major story for us, though it does happen from time to time. That means we, as journalists, have to put ourselves ""out there"" a lot more, too, to let people know what we're covering, what we're most interested in, and how we might be prioritizing our limited time. 

I hope that's not too vague, but that's how I see it...and yes, we really are strapped for time these days, so we have to be thoughtful in what we choose to cover. - Lauren",2
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Hello Nunoaphex! Michael here. I absolutely LOVE low-cost smartphones. There's certainly a tier of phone that's too cheap (maybe spend more than $200/€200 to make sure you're getting a decent camera and screen) but it is becoming increasingly the case that you do NOT need to spend $1000 to get a great experience. You don't even need to spend $500 most of the time. And cheaper phones keep getting better. Not only that, but they are often more repairable than flagship iPhones and Galaxies. I'm a Pixel user myself, and I always encourage people to check out the A-series Pixel, which is almost as awesome as the fancy one but so much more affordable.

The only caveat is that the big accessory makers often ignore anything that's not a big-name phone. So if you want a case, your options can be super limited. That's one nice thing about Nothing, they also make good accessories, so you don't feel that problem as much. —Michael Calore",4

technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Michael here, hi Tucklegursk. I DO think we should be excited about the fediverse. If you think back a decade and a half or so, the fediverse adheres to the same principals that served as the foundation for the first wave of social media platforms. Sites were interoperable, built on open standards, and social actions could be shared between networks. (Friend Feed, anyone?) At some point, the walls went up around the big platforms, they stopped making it easy to share, and they started locking users in so they could better monetize against their behavior. (Not saying making money is bad necessarily, but interoperability and profit don't have to be mutually exclusive.) Anyway, the fediverse today presents a path forward for people who want open data streams on the internet. As to whether it will take a leap forward, I hope so. It requires full buy-in from all the key players, and (sorry but) that's not likely. So we will probably have a healthy and fun OPEN social internet, and then several big, closed social platforms. Same as it ever was, but more choice for users in the end, so that's good. —Michael Calore",3
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Hi! I'm genuinely thrilled to hear someone is interested in this not-yet-fully-realized project of mine.

The TL;DR is that my plan is to deliver it in 2025 and I'm hopeful it will publish in the same calendar year, too. The longer answer is that book-writing is a new process for me (longer deadlines, deeper work) that requires the kind of time I haven't carved out yet. 

This year has been a BIG YEAR at Wired...I moved onto our business desk, I've been working on our Big Interview series, and we just launched this **new pod**. But I'm taking a short creative leave next year to work on the book. - Lauren

technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Oof, gen AI is already having a profound impact on the media industry because so much of our business model (at least in digital media) is based on traffic. I think there’s a potentially positive shift here in that we’ll inherently need to start focusing on cultivating an audience rather than trying to simply court page views (ahem, looking at you “what happened last night on GOT” posts). But that’s easier said than done, of course, and right now we’re having a bit of an existential crisis. - Zoë",2
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,Hi! Can you re-ask or clarify what you mean by this question?,1
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"I think it's been harder for some startups to raise in this environment and lots of people would love to see a return of ZIRP, but I also hear from others (both VCs and founders) that they can still raise if they're hyper-focused and verticalized on what they're building.

Yes, a lot of firms are throwing money at AI startups to see what sticks. A lot of them won't sustain, particularly if they're paying giant fees to the frontier AI companies and building app layers on top of that. VCs know this. It's a high-risk industry.

But they also look at ""picks and shovels"" companies (who wouldn't love to invest in the next Nvidia), logistics, productivity, energy, healthcare, and AI companies who can carve out a nice niche for themselves. -Lauren",1
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Hi PeggyKTC. This is Michael, but I'm sure my cohosts will have thoughts here too. Honestly that aspect is one of the most important parts of our jobs. I work closely with the team that writes WIRED's product reviews, and any good product review has to include a thorough test of the company's claims about the product, as well as follow-up on whether the company delivered on what it said it was going to back when the product was announced. The review should also provide context about where the product sits within its category. So if something about the product is touted as a new feature, but other companies are already doing the same thing, we'll say so. —Michael Calore.",1
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Hey Ally! Thanks for the question (and reading my book! I’m grateful). This question is complicated since a lot of the current efforts focus on age verification in a way that hurts privacy. I generally like the Reddit method where there’s a certain behavioral “floor” that all users have to adhere to and then smaller communities can decide beyond that how they want to moderate. 

I have a meta point on trust and safety related projects — I think there has to be a real shift in how big tech thinks about T&S — right now it really feels like a cost center and an inhibitor to swift product development. Really, it should be viewed as a core part of the business and something that saves the company money (insofar as it avoids regulatory fines) and time (in the form of cleaning up avoidable messes). Not to mention the potential reputations benefits! Also, if these projects are going to be taken seriously, the teams working on them need to report to the CEO or founder. - Zoë",2

In terms of your second question, I think the most important attribute in editorial decision making is leading with curiosity. It’s so, so important to cultivate genuine curiosity about the people we’re covering and why they do what they do.

technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Great question! I think there’s a balance between holding companies accountable to past promises and acknowledging that, particularly for startups, things change —sometimes very rapidly! The stakes are different when the change is say, a feature that was promised vs a policy that impacts user privacy. I’ll also just say that when I was reporting on Elon Musk and X a lot of my job felt like fact checking these “new” claims. Were the encrypted DMs really encrypted when they launched (nope) and were they really new (not if you count the fact that much of the source code was allegedly written years before!) - Zoë",1
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Thanks Zoë- I agree about T&S teams needing to be seen as core to the business and report directly to the CEO or have a “Chief Member Officer” or T&S focused COO. Basically a way to have integrity be central to the platforms. 

Some have certainly gone the other way in recent years, which is very sad. 

I don’t love that the solutions seem to be so legislatively focused, as governments tend to try to force a certain perspective on people and I (naively perhaps) believe in people’s ability to think for themselves and recommend giving them the tools to do so. But legislation seems to be the best tool to affect change currently.",2
technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"Yesss to what Zoe said, about being curious. I often say that one of the best parts of our job is we constantly get to talk to people who are smarter than us (OK, some of them think they're very smart...but a lot of them are) and get to learn so much and hear different viewpoints on everything we cover. If a source reaches out to you with a story that \*they\* feel is super important, but, you don't see how it's a full story, how it benefits your readers, or it just feels like it's not getting your curiosity going, then it might be a pass.

AM(us)A!,"For me this goes back to what Zoe said earlier about curiosity...if I write a story about a product, a company, a movement, etc, I'm naturally interested in checking back in several months or a year later to see what came of it.

I did this recently with a story about OpenAI's GPT Store, which had promised AI developers the opportunity to make money from the Store, and that hasn't exactly panned out as promised.

technology,1gftoz0,Hi! We're the hosts of WIRED's new tech culture podcast Uncanny Valley. AM(us)A!,"As complex as compliance is, I’m kind of loving the EU legislative framework so far. It’s forcing companies to get creative and find ways to validate age without undermining users’ right to privacy. 

It needs more work, especially around methods for compliance, but tech is really good at innovation and it seems that fines are the only way to get big tech to respect users. 

There’s a particularly anarchistic part of me that wants a platform to exist that uses zero knowledge proofs of identity to tie accounts to humans and enables open discourse around statements similar to Wikipedia on all posts. I’d love to see inflammatory or misinformation posts be tagged with [citation needed], then given a mask to find accurate information if shown to be false or misleading. 

BUT that’s a sword without a hilt because giving one entity the ability to define truth is… problematic… and assigning truth based on mass opinion sounds like a horrible idea. The source of truth is the challenge here. 

Anyway, overall, I like the EU rules with all of their challenges and hope to see more work happen to create the ability to have authentic digital interactions",1

these sentences are perfect examples why a lot of the posts in here that claim to know exactly how a second Trump administration is going to play out feel so misplaced. The likely administration is hardly homogenous, except for fealty - at least feigned fealty - to Trump. There are a lot of fans of Section 230's expansive protections among Trump's new BFFs in Silicon Valley. I'm not sure those folks - Musk included as the owner of Twitter - will want a stricter reading of Section 230. I think there's likely to be a lot of infighting among these various factions.

As much as a great deal has been made of the *""adults in the room""* \- like Session, Kelly, etc - who served as guardrails during the first administration, I think that the infighting and bickering within that first administration also served as a set of de facto guardrails, and very well may again.

Crossing conservatives last December, he agreed to transition the Postal Service’s entire fleet to electric vehicles by 2026.

The president appoints cabinet members to advise the President on any subject he or she may require relating to the duties of each member’s respective office, but Congress has to vote to agree/disagree with his choices.

But data caps isn't just about downloading video games, but also browsing reddit or youtube. Looking at porn or high resolution pictures, etc. Any kind of internet activity will upload and download information to your devices, and the moment you hit your data cap it will slow down to a crawl. 

Ususally data caps are offered on a tiered system. 100 gb might be 10 bucks, 200 gb 20 bucks or 1 tb for 150 dollars. The original intention was to make customers more choosy about when to use the mobile internet, as too much traffic was bad due to the limits in bandwidth available. These concerns aren't as pressing compared to the early 2000s, as infrastructure has generally been built to handle bigger loads.

The man is Ekrem İmamoğlu, current mayor of Istanbul and one of the ""main men"" of the main opposition party. The woman is some random idiot, who complains about everything being too expensive and then accuses İmamoğlu and his party, to his face, of ruining the economy. Of course İmamoğlu or his party had not been in charge of the economy for many decades at that point. He tells the woman exactly that, and he tells her that the government is responsible of managing the economy. She then dismisses him and says that she's happy with the government. My respect for İmamoğlu increased significantly when I first saw that video because how calmly and respectfully he responds to the absolute braindead moron in front of him.

So yes, people like that *are* that stupid and the denial *is* that strong. They are capable of recognizing shit's gone bad, but they're incapable of holding ""their side"" responsible for it even if it requires some impressive mental gymnastics to avoid seeing reason. There's documented public proof of that. The video is from Turkey, but dumb humans work the same everywhere so don't think your country, wherever you're from, would be immune.",1

The USPS Board of Governors has 9 Governors, which are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and a Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General, which are both selected by the board. Only 5 Governors can belong to one party.

The Governors are appointed to 7-year terms, so presidents can't just replace the entire board when they're elected. Biden aggressively nominated Governors to replace those whose terms had expired. Only one of Trump's appointees remains (Duncan) and his term doesn't expire until December of 2025.

He needed two more Democratic Governors to take control of the board and those terms just recently expired. He nominated two Democrats to those positions (Walsh and Demings), but the confirmations have been held up in the Senate for two reasons:

**1)** Republican Senators placed holds on them and nearly 40 other nominations. Positions like these are usually confirmed via unanimous consent, which is a quick process that doesn't consume much floor time. If a Senator places a hold on a nominee, they can't be confirmed via unanimous consent, which forces the Senate Majority Leader to utilize multiple days of floor time for each confirmation as the holding Senator's party slows the process in any way possible. This also prevents other Senate business from being conducted.

**2)** Democrats currently hold a razor-thin majority in the Senate. Only 47 Senators are actual Democrats — 3 are Independents who caucus with Democrats (King, Sanders, Manchin) and 1 is an Independent who doesn't caucus with Democrats (Sinema).

So, what is ordinarily a quick process has become an arduous process that consumes multiple days of floor time for each of the 40 nominees and after all that, Manchin and Sinema aren't even guaranteed votes and we need at least one of them provided every other Senate Democrat votes to confirm.

Further adding to this is the fact that the board doesn't even seem interested in replacing the current Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, so the addition of the two other Democrats is unlikely to change anything. 

Ultimately, it's not surprising that Schumer isn't wasting valuable floor time on their confirmations. Hopefully they're able to confirm them before the new Senate is sworn in.",2

No, there is a real chance of a run away climate shift. [Just go look at the water vapor curve](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/moisture-holding-capacity-air-d_281.html) .

You know maybe at 1C you get an extra .1C from it, at 2C maybe .22C, 3C, .35C. But somewhere on this curve, you'll increase the air by 1C and water vapor will grow that by 1C.

Biden dropped out on July 21^(st), just 107 days before the election. Ohio's filing deadline for presidential candidates to appear on the ballot was August 7^(th). That's just 17 days apart. If the DNC decided to run a second primary instead, in that 17 days they would have had to:

- Systematically return all donations to Biden back to donors

- Field candidates for the primary

- Wade through state laws in every state on how to conduct an unprecedented second primary, if that's even legal in that state

- Allow for a primary campaigning period and possibly a debate

- Conduct all primary votes on the same day in all states and tally results

- Delay and then hold the DNC nominating convention to formally nominate the candidate with the most delegates

- Submit that candidate's name to each state for the general ballot

All that in 17 days. Then that candidate would have to re-raise all the funds returned to donors and then finally campaign using those funds.

Learned way more than I ever wanted to about peering and ISP data costs. At the end of the day content costs the ISPs money. Not a lot, but it's not a fixed price business. They make the most money when you don't use the pipe much.

- For cable operators they avoid splitting nodes in neighborhoods when they are not fully utilized which has an equipment cost + a somewhat expensive fiber run cost back to their CO.
- All the operators save money when they can avoid additional fiber or transceiver upgrades to back haul data.
- Peering with other ISPs and CDNs is not without cost. If more data enters and leaves your network, even if within the metro, you're still paying for the equipment, transceivers, and cross connect fees for the fiber.

Comcast wants a bunch of grandmas to pay for gigabit and use it to check their email. They make a killing on that. They're not a huge fan of someone buying gigabit and running torrents day and night. They still make money on it, but they are greedy fucks that like to make lots of money. They don't want to split that node in your neighborhood. They don't want to upgrade a backhaul.

Putting caps does cause users to choose more selectively on how to use their data, turning off Netflix when it's playing in the background, playing videos at 1080p rather than 4k, keeping games stored locally rather than deleting and redownloading later, etc. It would save money.

I can and do blame GOP voters. I also blame the DNC for running a campaign all the data told them wouldn’t work.

I also begrudgingly waited four hours in line to vote for hillary in 2016, and I mailed in for biden 2020. viable harm reduction is always a better choice than electing the worst guy ever. 

roan expressing ambivalence is one thing, but her not wholeheartedly endorsing harris is the DNC's fault for not running on a more appealing and relevant platform. i agree that it wasn't exactly pragmatic in the grand scheme, but that also should have been a learning moment for the DNC, instead of something to ignore, write-off, or downplay. 

all they have to do is run on progressive populism. they will win. most people in this country, including a shitload of trump supporters, want cheaper healthcare, better wages, billionaires and international conglomerates to pay their fair share; and for the failed establishment to recognize both their and its own issues in favor of a shift in priorities. hell, obama was a milquetoast candidate, but his vague populism (and immense charisma) carried him into office for eight years.

all that said, I don't think the DNC is truly open to learning from this mistake yet, even though it was 2016 all over again, even though republicans stonewalled obama for a decade, even though republicans have been doing the exact same shit at varying degrees for 40+ years, etc. 

they're just trying to find someone to blame. muslims did this! gen-z men did this! hispanic men did this! white women did this! black men did this! progressives did this! republicans did this! (they did, but that's a given/besides the point. the ""normal"" or ""reasonable"" republicans were going to, and always will, vote for the republican candidate compared to any establishment dem running neolib policies.)

technology,1gm4b1j,Intel says it's bringing back free office coffee to boost morale after a rough year,"Worked for a large defense contractor for 30 years. It never had free coffee provided to the employees. When I first started, they had recently allowed the employees to chip in and buy commercial Bunn machines to have a coffee fund. It was that way until a couple years previous - employees brought the coffee in with the machines they had purchased and some employees ran the coffee fund. They made up a bullshit excuse that it was a fire hazard for employees to have coffee makers, so they banned it at the urging of the company that ran the company cafeteria - now they had to walk across the street (out of their 5 story building) to buy coffee at the cafeteria, under the guise of ""fire safety."" So, all the coffee addicts started bringing in their own coffee machines, or just heating coils to make hot water for instant coffee, and keeping them in their desks which created a real fire hazard. After a few incidents in which the billion dollar high tech building could have burned to the ground, they finally rescinded the stupid rule.

When I started I was on a floor of 100 engineers and took over the coffee fund. 10 cents per cup, or $2 per week for all you could drink and free doughnuts on Fridays. I brought in two cases of coffee per week and kept the well used Bunn machine in order. I would buy the coffee at Sam's Club or Costco and pay by credit card, and all the bills and coins I would bring home every day and put it in a giant piggy bank, keeping a log to ensure I was not making too much profit. At the end of the year, my wife and I broke open the piggy bank (it was shaped like a 2 foot high pig and ceramic and had to actually be broken to access) and there was $5000. We went to Hawaii for vacation. 

Anyway, I got moved to a lab where I continued to run a small coffee fund (took up a collection and bought another commercial Bunn machine). Our offices were in a lab, so on a raised floor. Technically, you are not allowed to drink coffee or eat in a raised floor lab, but when there were offices in a lab they did not enforce that rule, plus no one paid attention to that anyway, and the dozens of engineers who worked in there daily almost all had food and drink during the day. Got a new manager a few years ago who was ex military, and not an engineer.  He read the rules and discovered that no food and drinks, or coffee makers or kitchen appliances, were allowed in labs, but here we were with two coffee machines, a microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator, etc.  We had to get rid of all of them and if we wanted coffee, we had to walk down a floor to a kitchen that had a shitty company-supplied Keurig machine. One guy with an office in my lab got a small coffee maker and kept it in his desk. As well as a small refrigerator he kept way under his desk. I myself put in my three month notice and retired a few years sooner than I had originally intended.",2

technology,1gm4b1j,Intel says it's bringing back free office coffee to boost morale after a rough year,"Story time - years ago I worked for an oil company in Calgary and head office decided to save money by eliminating the free coffee pot and put in a coffee machine.

You know..those machines that dispense some sort of dark liquid that tastes like burnt radiator fluid and they call it coffee.

So anybody that wanted coffee just left and went to the coffee shop down the street, and of course stopped at all the offices on the floor saying we're going for coffee, want to come with?

So several times a day, all worked stopped as several people waited for the stragglers to ""finish up"" and left the building for about 45 minutes to get coffee. The ""bean counters"" policy probably saved a hundred bucks a month on coffee and lost a few hundred hours of useful work. Within two months the free coffee was back but a lot of people still went out for coffee.",2

technology,1gm4b1j,Intel says it's bringing back free office coffee to boost morale after a rough year,"I work for Red Hat, but mostly travel to clients for my job.  Every few months I go to our Tyson's Corner Virginia office.  Free snacks, coffee, and cold drinks.

Cold drinks includes cans of La Croix sparkling water.  Never am I so hydrated as when I go into the office.  

There's no standard, daily provided lunch but there's often catered meetings with current or potential clients, and we can descend upon the leftovers like the locusts we are.

For a while there was cold-brew nitro coffee but they had to stop that because we were complete goblins.  We'd go through a month's worth of cold brew kegs in a day.  It wasn't so much the cost as the person who had to keep replacing them every half hour was going nuts.  I 100% don't blame them for stopping the cold brew, they'd have had to brought it in by the tanker-truck just to meet the demand.  It was the logistics that killed it, not the money.

Our headquarters in Raleigh, NC has a cafeteria that provides very resonably priced breakfast and lunch along with the free coffee, snacks, and cold drinks (I'm not sure if they do dinner as well, never needed to check), and there's often free treats days, like free ice cream sundaes or platters piled high with bagels and spreads.  The Tysons office sometimes does the bagel thing too.

Side note:  I love working for Red Hat, and it's not because of the sparkling water.  It's because of the people.

I started before the IBM purchase, and it really hasn't made a noticeable difference in my job.  Before IBM:  travel to clients and build or fix their stuff.  After IBM: travel to clients and build or fix their stuff.",1

technology,1gm4b1j,Intel says it's bringing back free office coffee to boost morale after a rough year,"Money doesn't make people happier about work either. What makes people happy at work is being able to do something productive in an environment that isn't toxic. 

I had two low paying jobs in the same wearhouse when I was young. One was just ok, it's work, it makes me money. Clock out and forget about. The other I had a coworker that was toxic I had to work with. 

He was the son in law of the person that managed that section of the wearhouse so the only thing was to bare it or leave. I went home every night exhausted from the stress in a job that was just about doing physical work. I dreaded going to work in the mornings. 

I moved to another job as fast as I could, but I needed to work so couldn't just quit. When I quit they offered me a raise to stay, I made an excuse about the amount I was being paid, told them it was under the table, so they couldn't match it. It wasn't the money, I just didn't want to work there anymore. 

I have had better and worse career jobs over the years, and it mostly has been about the manager whether the job was good or bad. I loved what I did as a career, but a bad manager would make it feel like having to do a Shawshank Redemption crawl to get my work done. 

The only exception to this is one contract job at a major telecom. The gig was for three months, I finished the project in three weeks working as slow as possible. I had no more work and they weren't giving me more even through I asked for more things to do. It was very much protecting my rice bowl there, so there was no more work for me to do.

People in the comments are saying that the phones themselves are suspected of rebooting automatically, but that's not the story.

The suspicion being raised here is actually that *bringing an iPhone which has been updated to iOS 18 near* is enough to trigger a less up-to-date iPhone that has been sitting for some time without network signal, or in a faraday box, to reboot itself.

Seems like a real fringe case for Apple to have bothered developing for, but here it is for discussion:

>The document says that three iPhones running iOS 18.0, the latest major iteration of Apple’s operating system, were brought into the lab on October 3. The law enforcement officials’ hypothesis is that “the iPhone devices with iOS 18.0 brought into the lab, if conditions were available, communicated with the other iPhone devices that were powered on in the vault in AFU. That communication sent a signal to devices to reboot after so much time had transpired since device activity or being off network.” They believe this could apply to iOS 18.0 devices that are not just entered as evidence, but also personal devices belonging to forensic examiners.",1407

It was and is disappointing but it corroborates my own experience and the frequent criticisms leveled at law enforcement. 

Police are often in difficult situations. Dangerous situations, to themselves and others. Another friend wounded while making an arrest and she spent a few months in the hospital. It’s freaking terrifying. It’s also terrifying to have four officers with their hands resting on their hips above their pistols show up the door. Bad guys are bad, we have a social contract, and we have police to help protect us from bad guys. Far too many people who’ve done nothing at all wrong, who are not bad, are harmed by police. 

We have rights enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. If they obstruct the fair and necessary conduct of law enforcement then the Constitution should be changed. Until it is, those rights apply to everyone. The police are clearly pressing that issue as it is, and it’s just wild that they’d openly complain about something like this.",-11

*[...] In a proposed class action, a New York man, Mark Vanvalkenburgh, said that he regretted falling for Intel's marketing of its 13th-gen CPU as ""the world’s fastest desktop processor"" capable of delivering ""the best gaming, streaming and recording experience"" available today.*

*He and possibly millions of others ""reasonably"" believed both the 13th- and 14th-gen CPUs would ""perform as advertised""—only to discover they'd purchased a reliably ""unstable"" product triggering ""random screen blackouts and random computer restarts"" that PC Mag warned perhaps caused ""permanent"" CPU damage.*

*If Vanvalkenburgh and other class members had known about the product defects, they wouldn't have paid a premium price for Intel's CPUs, the complaint said. Class members include anyone who purchased the defective products across the US, as well as a sub-class pursuing additional claims that includes any New York-based buyers.*

*It's unclear how many class members there are since Intel maintains that not all products sold were defective. Until discovery identifies all class members, the complaint casts a wide net, estimating that ""based on Intel’s sales, there are hundreds of thousands or millions of proposed class members.""*

*Vanvalkenburgh alleged that Intel became aware of the defects by ""late 2022 or early 2023."" Not only did Intel allegedly see ""unusually high"" return rates on the CPUs within months of the 13th-gen release, but also media reports throughout 2023 and 2024 confirmed outcry from users remained consistent, Vanvalkenburgh alleged.*

AOL is what I grew up on and where I first learned how to hack and start programming. It gave me so many hours and years of learning and I made so many friends, many who I still keep in contact with today.

Hacking OH and <INT>< accounts to scroll. Phishing users. Brute forcing accounts at crazy rates (20k attempts a second) because CAPTCHAs werent invented yet. Spamming porn in chat rooms. Joining all the warez chat rooms (Arise & MoB) to DL The Sims and other games that would be delivered via like 25 emails because of filesize limits. Hanging out in all the hacker chats. 1IM punting people. German TOSing people. All the cchats and proggies that people made. FireToolz. Gothic Nightmares. AOHell. Ded account exploits. the 1-2 char username exploit.  Oh, the fun that was had.

If you think about it, not much has changed. Teenagers these days are still infiltrating and hacking large companies.

How long depends on the industry, some will happen almost immediately and others might take 6-8 moths.

If half of the stuff he was talking about as far as tariffs go get in place, the economy crashes hard right before the midterms. The Republicans get voted out, because that's how mid terms typically go and we are in a ""its the economy, stupid"" moment. 

The way to avoid that crash it to limit the scope and size of the tariffs. I don't know if enough sane heads will prevail and do that. A bunch of Republicans know this, but its unclear whether they will go with whatever tariff plan or not. How bad the crash is determines how many seats the Republicans loose in 2026.

technology,1glr67l,"Before the Election, Tech C.E.O.s Were Quietly Courting Trump","I wouldn't be surprised if it's potentially up in the next 6 months. tariffs on solar panels that make it so you pretty much have to buy American would be good for an American based renewable company. 

One of the things with American manufacturing is that they kind of suck at keeping up with demand. So they could even raise prices. 

Ultimately renewables are a thing that if you're sitting on cash, it's worthwhile to buy. Just look at the math over a very long period of time. 

Not adjusting for inflation a barrel of oil was $1.17 in 1946, $12 in 1976, $67.92 in 2006, and let's say $80 in 2036. All together that's $161.09 covering 120 years. A barrel of crude oil contains about 5,800,000 British thermal units (Btu) of energy, or 1,700 kilowatt-hours (kWh). So those 4 barrels produced 6,800 kWh over 120 years. 

In ideal conditions, a 400W solar panel can produce up to 2.4 kWh of electricity *per day* and lasts about 30 years. 



Price | Energy | Time
---|---|----
$160| 6,800 kWh| 120 Years
$200| 26,280,000 | 30 Years

Now, imagine buying and replacing your solar panels every 30 years. Simply adding inflation to the price of today. 

With 2.3% inflation:

In 30 years: $395.64
In 60 years: $782.65
In 90 years: $1548.24

So, add the $200 price today.  You get $2,726.53 to generate 105,120,000 kWh by 2144


They just aren't even in the same league. If you needed to generate 105 million kWh in 2144 with Oil at $1,225.08 a barrel. It would cost you $18 million dollars. Even if oil was somehow immune to inflation and still only cost $100 a barrel in 100 years, it would still cost ~$1.5 million dollars to produce the same amount of energy. 

Obviously nobody is really planning 100+ years into the future. But the contrast is so incredible. $2,726 vs. $18,736,517 that I am sure many people and companies are looking down the road and saying, we need to get off of oil as fast as possible pretty much no matter what happens to the price of solar panels (within reason). 

You can add the price of batteries, maintenance, whatever you want to solar. It wouldn't change the main structure. Oil and gas require constant consumption by an outside supplier. You are also taxed on your consumption. Solar could be fully off-grid and untaxed.",12

For his party, correct. They want the division because their base is motivated by fear and anger, and the ""other"". They *must* have a bad guy to unite against. As a result they *actively* oppose working with the other side and have proven it literally dozens and dozens of times over.

technology,1gluqbu,Anger in Taiwan over reports SpaceX asked suppliers to move abroad,"Part from article: 
Taiwan’s government says it is paying close attention to reports that Elon Musk’s SpaceX asked Taiwanese suppliers to move manufacturing to other countries because of “geopolitical” concerns.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that SpaceX’s request to suppliers in Taiwan’s multibillion-dollar industry appeared to have prompted some to shift locations to Vietnam, Thailand and other places. In response, Taiwan’s economic affairs minister, JW Kuo, said the industry was strong and “should be able to cope”, but that the government was monitoring the situation.


“There is no such information on its official website, but some foreign media are reporting it, and we are paying close attention to it. I think the supply chain in Taiwan is very strong and it should be able to cope with the situation,” Kuo said.

“Short-term political factors should not affect the supply-chain relationship between international satellite companies and Taiwan manufacturers.”

There are 46 Taiwanese companies producing components and sensitive equipment for the global satellite industry, including for around a dozen companies that then directly supply SpaceX.",276

The problem for the US is that it is owned and operated by companies, who’s only objective is to extract as much money as possible from everyone, so your problem is actually the amount of profits collected and retained by these companies.

You can go ahead and stop putting money towards maintaining your global position that has put you in a better position. But the money saved will then become discretionary, there will be more money floating around the system - companies will realise this and raise the prices and there will be a more available money floating around, so people will spend more on the same thing to outbid, like housing and services. 

While understand your approach, you need to have a look at the wider picture. The USA has been so geopolitically involved with everything, outsourced work and used other countries where further change may not be as productive as you think.

I think part of that problem isn't that they don't care, I'd argue it's likely a resource problem. Like these cases rarely get completely dismissed bc these agencies going after these sickos take as much time gathering evidence as possible to ensure these sickos get locked up. 

I think also another big thing is how much more of a number you are in the world of the internet. Before there had to be physical evidence. They now can just hide behind several layers of the internet and not even have a physical anything. 

They also do a ton of stings on people who try and meet minors. They can only do this so much before the predators like every other criminal get somewhat wise to the stings and change their ways of getting this filth or meeting kids. 

Unfortunately I don't think this is just a matter of one two or three individual issues and resolutions but that of many different things, many different policies, many different ways of getting to the issue and resolution. It's easy to say a couple things, but I think it's a much more complicated issue than just ""those video games"" or the police aren't doing anything.

Parenting, these days, has a lot to be mindful of when it comes to their kids and technology. I mean, I was playing Coke Music, Sims Online, and had Xbox Live in its first month when I was in middle school. My first pc multiplayer online fps was Return to Castle Wolfenstein followed by Counter-Strike. RtCW was actually some of the most fun I ever had and I don't recall ever being creeped on in it. Sims Online and coke music, I most likely was chatting with some fucking weirdos... BUT I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO NOT GIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. I knew it was dangerous, my parents made it very clear it would cost me all of my Internet privileges until adulthood. I also didn't have a smartphone in my pocket... 


Neverwinter Nights was my other  big game. The amount of content on the different servers was astounding because the toolset that came with the was accessible enough and I used to even host servers with large, persistent world modules and had great experiences with teaming up with people and redoing dungeons. A lot of teamwork and laughing about goofy shit. Typing screams into the console anytime there was a giant spider and seeing others do the same... But there were hacky servers where impossible character builds could go up against hacky creatures. Those usually had a lot of dickhead players.


Those games, in their form of multiplayer, didn't necessarily allow for long-term relationships with other players. Servers had regular players, but once the server was down, that was that. 


These days, I would probably at least intermittently monitor a game like Roblox to get an idea of what's happening and only be alarmed when the content seems off for whatever reasons. TikTok would be banned for plenty of good reasons.",7

Not mostly no. The change in behavior certainly helped lower crimes against children but crimes against adults are down too. If your theory was correct you'd see adult crime rates higher than the past and that is not the case. I say that because crimes statistically fall and rise together.
  
The reason you believe the world is scarier now is the same reason parents keep their kids in more than they did in the past - the 24 hour news cycle scares the shit out of the country. Technology gave access to 24 hr news and journalism quickly evolved to compete for their audience and reported on the most attention grabbing and provoking stuff, non-stop for 24 hours. Murders, scandals, crime, disasters, war, sex, etc...
  
There's plenty of research, articles, polls, and studies on this topic but the consensus is that public perception of crime does not match reality. People think it's getting worse while it's getting better. In nearly every case it's not from first hand experiences either, it's being colored by their media exposure. 24 hr news cycle were the start of this but it got even worse with the explosion of the Internet and smart phones.

Australia plans to introduce a law that sets the minimum age for social media use at 16. This law will place the responsibility on social media platforms to enforce this age requirement. However, the methods for enforcement are still unclear. While options such as biometric scans and database checks have been mentioned, they are not mandatory.

The opposition has called for quick action, even through an ongoing federal trial on age-verification technology. Penalties will be directed at platforms failing to comply with the law rather than underage users or their parents. The government is attempting to address parental concerns about online safety but has not yet detailed specific methods for enforcement.",1

Understand that there is little to zero domestic manufacturing of these components. 

Most Nvidia products come from Taiwan. But often it is believed that Taiwan receives a lot its components from China. So China still receives a lion share of profit. 

When goods enter into a Port of Entry in the United States, they are categorized/documented under a category of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Every category has a different percentage of the total value of the shipment that is applied as a maximum.

https://www.hillebrandgori.com/media/publication/duties-tariffs-and-taxes-what-s-the-difference#:~:text=It%20is%20compulsory%20and%20applies,by%20the%20importer%20to%20customs.

Understand that tariffs are not a negative and the importer does not always pay the upfront cost. It's typically negotiated as part of the purchase and baked in prior to purchase. Many of the goods we purchase from around the globe are brought in at a reasonable cost. However, if those goods flood the American Market at a significantly cheaper price-and therefore cause the domestic production base to try to compete at a loss, a tariff can be increased very quickly to stem the flow of those cheaper goods. Thereby keeping the domestic producers alive, instead of being driven out of business.

GoPro had a drone called the Karma. DJI came in and stole the design of that and called it the Mavic. GoPro couldn't compete and shuddered the manufacturing division for that product line.",1

Trump’s plan to dial back AI regulations isn’t about being reckless, it’s about avoiding the kind of heavy handed government oversight that usually stifles progress and innovation. Biden’s orders may look like it’s all about safety but in reality it creates barriers that only big corporations can handle leaving smaller more innovative players out. Government red tape moves too slowly to keep up with fast paced fields like AI and the people who best understand these technologies should be the ones driving progress not bureaucrats. On the tariffs, I think he mostly sees them as a negotiating tactic rather than a fully fledged policy. Sure, they might make some tech supplies harder to get but the goal is strategic, protecting key industries and keeping leverage in trade discussions. Think about it this way. If AI development in the US is built upon tech entirely dependent on foreign manufacturing, especially from countries like China, it exposes America to a strategic vulnerability. Truly independent and resilient AI industry requires secure domestic supply chains even if that requires short term sacrifice. As for Musk’s influence on Trump’s policy approach some see it as problematic suggesting that business interests might override public good. But Musk like other tech entrepreneurs represents valuable perspective. His companies have driven technological advancements that have benefited society broadly (from reusable rockets to electric vehicles). Unlike career politicians or bureaucrats, he faces the market’s pressures making his innovations immediately accountable to consumer needs and preferences. The alternative is to leave the direction of AI development solely in the hands of government appointed regulators, which would risk suppressing precisely the type of dynamism that historically set America apart.",1

Explains the vast majority of weirdness nearly everyone has noticed to some degree since 2016, possibly even Covid.

Long af thought:
The absolute victory nobody predicted is too perfect to be authentic.  It’s impossibly ideal without having been created, planned, and executed.  To manufacture this outcome would take the coordinated efforts of Russia and China, using the capabilities of Elon Musks starlink and x.  
I don’t even think Trump realized the scope of this attack and likely didn’t care.  He couldn’t have known anything beyond who would be behind it or he wouldn’t have been capable of doing it so well.  How he plays the victim was essential for all of us to believe it.  It explains the weirdness of his would-be assassin who literally made him the victim of a bullet wound.  If the shooter weren’t a member of the same party, our country could have gone to war with each other.   This theory explains the off comments he made like “don’t vote - we have enough votes” and “you never have to vote again if just do this time.

Elon was just reported to have been in ongoing contact with Putin and explains how all 3 are linked. Elon admits that one call is to be a request from Putin help China.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-know-about-elon-musks-reported-phone-calls-with-putin-and-why-it-matters

Why would Musk and Putin be so close that Vlad asked Musk to do the Xi a favor?  Because China could be the silent assassin, planting chips and physical tech they needed to pull it off even more precisely this time.  What could Musk gain in return for granting favors not to just 1 rival, but the quid pro quo given to leaders of our TOP 2 most powerful adversaries? Explains Trumps tariffs idea - a gift to China at our expense and FU to him on a personal level for the way he’s spoken about China in the past.  China may have even started Covid to blame on Trump so he wouldn’t be reelected in 2020.  This explains how Russia knew what China is capable of and how they could land an even more devastating blow working together.

It was outrageous then for suggesting Russia meddled in our elections, but given that it actually worked how they wanted and had no obvious consequence, why wouldn’t China agree to help them do it again.  If they had pulled Covid off, using Russias army of bots and closeness to Trump to plan an undetectable way it would need to be done to pass as the results of our election.  Russia needs us out of Ukraine now and China is free to take Taiwan and Tariffs, while Trump will be blamed again.
They rid the world of the United States and reap every reward of our demise.

DJT dodges jail/losing his fortune to instead, simply join their leaders and ascend to his dream role as Dictator/Supreme Leader of The USA.  Elon will have free reign and every resources PLANET EARTH at his disposal to do whatever he wants on the way to reaching Mars without a single roadblock or red-tape. The Power and Might of the USA is decimated when our 2nd and 3rd most powerful enemies just put us in their pocket to use as needed.

This is beyond a nuclear strike.  Our 2 greatest enemies have joined forces.  They have leveraged Musks cooperation with using starlink and X for whatever he needs or wants to get us to Mars.  They took the desperation of Trump, used the ease with which they can manipulate him, magnified the ease with which his divisive nature cripples our society, they have manipulated our elections to engineer their perfect outcome. With Trump as POTUS and solid senate/house majorities, there is nothing he won’t capable of.  They know that just like in 2016, one half will blame the other, American vs. American, the respective bias of each will cause them to reject the question as to whether outside influence could have manipulated the votes. Russia and China have given us the political poison we will inject directly into our common veins while Trump presides over our collective suicide.  They and the world will feast on the bloated carcass of what was formerly the USA.  

The fact that this is a possible, even likely scenario, should unite our country and ignite the same fire against Russia and China now as it would have in 2001 if each country itself were piloting a plane into the towers.",0

Getting rid of the CHIPS act makes perfect sense because in the long run it would always be seen as a major victory out of the Biden administration so getting rid of it prevents that from happening. Look what they did to the ACA. It's pretty much in shambles now with annual premium increases, fewer dollars available for tax subsidies and coverages shrinking and out of pocket costs rising. All because they repealed the individual mandate. ACA is getting to the point of flat out sucking and now that can be blamed on Obama. Why fix it if ultimately Obama would get credit for it?

AI is huge so tariff the GPUs. The importer will pay the tariff. That cost will be passed on to the wholesaler (if that's a different entity) with a little bump in wholesale price on top of the tariff price increase. Wholesaler sells to the AI company where another price hike is snuck in. All the people at the top stand to earn record profits off something like that. Nobody really knows how much was paid in tariffs for a given shipment so you just accept the price increase for your goods. But even beyond the tariff being passed on to the consumer, hidden price gouging is happening on top of it. That's another win for Trump because the wealthy business owners will donate to his cause because he helped them get richer.

A lower court dismissed the case, labelling it a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation), an effort to silence free speech. Now, X is appealing this decision. Organisations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and others argue that allowing X to misuse contract law and anti-hacking statutes to retaliate against criticism would threaten free speech rights.

A study led by Hong Kong Polytechnic University supports the theory of Mars' watery past, revealing variations in depth within this region and formations indicative of previous aquatic activity. Published in *Scientific Reports*, the research provides a model for how Mars' ocean may have formed, contributing to the ongoing investigation into the planet's geological history.",4

Everyone wins on this, the Chinese get a delicacy, American farmers get more money, and American consumers actually get cheaper meat because it spreads out the costs of producing meat. So Trump puts tariffs on Chinese goods and the Chinese retaliate by putting tariffs on offal. So the Chinese start buying offal from Brazil maybe Australia. This costs the American rancher money because he can't sell his offal at a premium he increases the cost of tritips, ribeyes, and hamburger to make up for the lost revenue. This extra costs causes an uptick in inflation and that folks is why Trump is a fucking moron. Want to know more because you are an econ nerd?

technology,1gl9cil,Trump’s 60% tariffs could push China to hobble tech industry growth,"I have a question to all Trumpers that currently struggle to get by each month but still love Trump for his tariffs: Why? I really don't understand the appeal if you already think the cost of living is high as fuck.

Imagine two chairs: One is made in Canada and the other is made in the USA. They are exactly the same chair. Same wood, same craftsmanship, comparable logistics, that nice finish and so on. There is only one difference: The Canadian chair costs 15 bucks while the American one costs 30 bucks.

Now say you need a chair. Which one do you expect most people will buy? Correct! The Canadian one because it's cheaper (remember: Chairs are exactly the same by any other metric).

Now here comes Trump. And Trump has a big fat tariff on Canadian wood for all them Canadians. HAH! Shows them. Feckin' chumps. It's to protect that 'Merican chair manufacturer and keep them from taking our jerbs! Maybe anger some libs over there as well.

So now that same Canadian chair suddenly cost 45 bucks due to more expensive wood, and this makes the US chair the cheaper option all of a sudden because that one still only cost 30 bucks.

Now say you need a chair. Which one do you expect most people will buy this time? Yeah, probably the chair from the good 'ol US of A. But there's a catch though. As you can probably guess, the cost of living just went up. Previously you were able to buy the same chair for 15 Dollars. But after the tariffs on Canadian wood, you now need to pony up 30 Dollars. And as you can imagine, some people might even wait a bit longer before buying that chair now in order to save up if needed. Economic velocity goes down. Inflation has risen. And in the grand scheme of things, jobs will actually be lost due to lowering demands. All because Trump tried to 'protect' the market.

So, I ask you again: Why are you a fan of tariffs if you're also afraid of the rising cost of living? It makes no economic sense to me.",15

For the tech industry, already burdened by the impact of tariffs on their supply chains, it has likely become a matter of “when” not “if” companies will start spiking prices on popular tech.

During Trump’s last administration, he sparked a trade war with China by imposing a wide range of tariffs on China imports, and President Joe Biden has upheld and expanded them during his term. These tariffs are taxes that Americans pay on restricted Chinese goods, imposed by both presidents as a tactic to punish China for unfair trade practices, including technology theft, by hobbling US business with China.”",2

These are Biden’s new tariffs for China: 

The tariff rate on semiconductors will increase from 25% to 50% by 2025.

The tariff rate on certain steel and aluminum products under Section 301 will increase from 0–7.5% to 25% in 2024.

The tariff rate on electric vehicles under Section 301 will increase from 25% to 100% in 2024.

The tariff rate on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5%% to 25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate on battery parts will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024.
 
The tariff rate on natural graphite and permanent magnets will increase from zero to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate for certain other critical minerals will increase from zero to 25% in 2024.

The tariff rate on solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules) will increase from 25% to 50% in 2024.

The tariff rate on ship-to-shore cranes will increase from 0% to 25% in 2024.

The tariff rates on syringes and needles will increase from 0% to 50% in 2024. For certain personal protective equipment (PPE), including certain respirators and face masks, the tariff rates will increase from 0–7.5% to 25% in 2024. Tariffs on rubber medical and surgical gloves will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026.

As President Biden says, American workers and businesses can outcompete anyone—as long as they have fair competition. But for too long, China’s government has used unfair, non-market practices. China’s forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft have contributed to its control of 70, 80, and even 90 percent of global production for the critical inputs necessary for our technologies, infrastructure, energy, and health care—creating unacceptable risks to America’s supply chains and economic security. Furthermore, these same non-market policies and practices contribute to China’s growing overcapacity and export surges that threaten to significantly harm American workers, businesses, and communities.
 
Today’s actions to counter China’s unfair trade practices are carefully targeted at strategic sectors—the same sectors where the United States is making historic investments under President Biden to create and sustain good-paying jobs",2

Trump idolizes Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jung Un. Why would he do ANYTHING to stress the “friendships” he has with them like impose financial stresses on them? Trump is wanting to ally with these people! 

Tariffs are locally imposed import taxes that are paid by AMERICAN CITIZENS to the U.S. GOVERNMENT! It’s a way to get more tax money FROM U.S. citizens into the coffers of the United States government! With that said, the United States government spent $141 million dollars to pay for Trump to travel and play golf, much of which was paid to the Mar A Lago golf course, owned by Donald Trump himself. 

Trump cares about his reputation and his relationships with his buddies. He does not care about the American people nor their financial struggles! The only “suffering” China will feel is the loss of income when all of the purchases from the U.S. dry up  because none of us can afford to buy their products due to being taxed further for them. 

Please understand what’s happening. Trump has depended on the stupidest people of the USA, their ignorance and their laziness. Their unwillingness to even read a god damned dictionary. All in an effort to get them to vote against their own self interests and wellbeing. This is why he’s removing the department of education. Educated citizens defend themselves and their interest.

technology,1gl9cil,Trump’s 60% tariffs could push China to hobble tech industry growth,"#A tariff is just a tax that is spelled differently.

So stupid, China is selling something (in this case tech), why would they pony up money to sell something to someone out of their own pockets? The person (company) buying eats the fee, they can't turn a profit if they're getting hit at 60% so they in turn pass that on to the customer.     

So say you need a toaster.      
$20 pre-tariff.      
$32 post-tariff.         

Presume 5,000 units a month being imported, that's $100,000 a month in toasters @ $20 / ea. but **bam** here comes the tariff and there's another $60,000 someone needs to pay to Uncle Sam. China for sure ain't paying that to be able to do business with the US, they can take their factory time and do something else in that case.       

So that $60k hike needs to be paid if a US company needs their goods. And they can't sell pretend toasters. They pony up the cash but they're not going to eat a $12 loss per item that sells for $20, so guess what they pass that on to us consumers.         

Your television service provider, your streaming or video game service, cloud stuff, AWS, Azure, etc. they need parts or servers guess what it now costs more. They ain't gonna be eating that price difference for regular old me or you that's for sure.    

Great job people who hates taxes, you *might* get a bit less taxes or a fatter return but you now have tariffs. And no one sprinkling that shit down on us regular Joes.      

Jobs in the US? No one making shitty $20 toasters over here. By the time the factory is setup and you hire people that's a $55 toaster with $15 toaster quality. The US isn't going to be making NAND chips, our own diodes and capacitors or none of that stuff. If lucky the US *might* import such parts and get automated machines to slap them into a PCB but that's not what we'd consider jobs for the masses since it's a robot doing it with imported goods to boot.",1

""Even with two years of tariffs on its competition under its belt, Whirlpool’s 2019 net sales still [tanked](https://s22.q4cdn.com/226840148/files/doc_financials/annual/2019/WhirlpoolCorp-Annual-Report-2019.pdf) by more than 5% compared to the previous year. And like its competitors, Whirlpool ultimately raised its prices to make up for lost revenue.

While it’s true that Whirlpool has been able to add 200 new jobs since the measures were first implemented, its foreign competitors have also made contributions to the U.S. labor force. Samsung and LG were both in the process of opening manufacturing plants at the time the tariffs were first introduced, and although it came as a major blow to their operations, these facilities created more than [1,500](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/trump-extends-tariff-rate-quotas-on-washers-hurting-samsung-lg) new jobs for Americans.

Although Whirlpool, LG, and Samsung created over 1,700 new jobs for Americans, which is welcome news, comparing those numbers against consumer costs paints a different picture. Because families ultimately bear the tariff burden downstream in the form of higher prices, import taxes on washing machines have cost Americans over [$800,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines.html) per job created.

It certainly comes as no surprise that Whirlpool [commended](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-washers/trump-extends-safeguard-tariffs-on-large-washer-imports-for-two-years-idUSKBN29J2SD) the Trump administration’s extension, proclaiming, “\[this\] culminates a nearly decade-long effort by Whirlpool Corporation to help ensure free and fair trade policies that benefit both our consumers and our 15,000 U.S. employees.”""",289

The DNC ran her out with trumps 2020 immigration policy. Biden fucked up by being in the primaries to begin with. 60 percent of Americans thought the country was heading in the wrong direction…. And then You put forth a person, and have her basically say she is the same damn candidate, with more regressive policy than the guy people are unhappy with. Everyone gets all libed up, and think they have it in the bag. And realize that the internet is for kids my age who don’t fucking vote.

And the last time America was promised shit by Obama, he didn’t come through with it. Yes it’s the republicans that gutted the ACA. But the neo liberal way is to compromise in the worst ways. Doesn’t fucking help that other shit was hidden in the ACA anyways. Promises compromised and broken.

People think the Dems are some bastion of fucking hope but they are republicans with better social values. Okay but how will they make my life better? What can they do. What will they do. I don’t agree with anything other than social policy that doesn’t affect me. I live with a fucking trans women who feels the same way.

The DNC blames the voters every fucking time they lose. But I am 29 and I have never been given something to vote for. Just against. 

I voted for Harris. But my vote was cast knowing I am basically voting for a republican. I fucking loathed it. But I have a black sister. I have a Mexican sister. I have more races i am half related to by blood than most races half the country has fucking met. So I did it. But I voted for 2016 trump who wasn’t a racist two days ago. (His policies where centrist back then if you remember)

The DNC does something really fucking cool too. When you ask them about anything like Medicare for all, corporate tax increases (which would still be lower than under fucking bush with the raise), social safety nets and how I can be helped they give you a little pat on the head and shush you like a child and tell you they’ll figure it out later. All my fucking adult life. Been awhile, ain’t shit happening.

I can't really explain it properly in a reddit post, but the gist of it is, US Treasury Bonds are currently considered one of the safest ways to park money on the planet. It's not *quite* as safe and liquid as just keeping your investments in cash, but it's damn close.


Because of this, investors buy Treasury bonds when they need to make sure their money is absolutely safe. Banks, Mutual Funds, Retirement Accounts, and Pensions are all heavily invested in treasuries.


If the U.S. were to default, it would trigger a panic that would make 2007 look like a joke. Bondholders wouldn't be able to redeem mature bonds, which would REALLY fucking suck if you're, say, a 70- year-old retiree who needs to make a withdrawal for their living expenses.


Now, you'd still be able to salvage some money by selling to speculators banking on the Treasury EVENTUALLY honoring the bills. But the bondholders would gave to sell them at way less than face value bc who tf is going to buy a $100 bond for $100, if there's no guarantee they'll actually be able to get that money back?


So essentially you'll have banks and retirees lose a substantial amount of their equity overnight. Nightmare scenario.


And that's not even the half of it. If the Treasury defaults, noone is going to touch new bonds, so their ability to raise money by issuing debt will be gone. So now the government won't be able to pay its workers, contractors, or retirees unless it prints money. Which, obv would be terrible.

Energy density is something that, outside of niche applications (like an air craft carrier) literally doesn't matter

> and I don’t think covering huge swaths of land is a good option

here's the fun part: it's not a huge swath of land. it's a fraction of the land we piss away on ethanol production

and we can mixed use the land as well.   Wind farms mix perfectly fine with farm fields, grazing lands, etc.   solar panels turn out actually work really well in a system called ""agrivoltaics"" where you plant crops under them, with a little extra spacing so the panels only block half the light - the panels and plants both end up benefitting.  

> The cost of production of the PVs and turbines (which need to be replaced at least every 15-20 years) seems under counted when looking at costs.

it may seem undercounted to you, but it's not under counted at all.  they're that cheap

Solar and Wind don't create CO2.  

anyone claiming they do is using the current power grid co2 costs and applying that to their construction, but that is *the current grid* not *The panels*.  once their factories are entirely renewable powered they those factories will be zero too

also you're totally forgetting that the construction of a nuclear power plant releases VAST amounts of CO2 in the concrete production - and that isn't just ""current energy grid"" that is literally an unavoidable part of concrete production.

Also biomass is a viable but limited source of energy. A few thousand tWh per year can be derived from waste streams without logging. This makes it slightly more relevant than nuclear for the global energy mix as it is very cheap to store and use as backup..

Even dedicated solid biomass farming isn't a total non-solution, it yields about 1W/m^2 which is like a very poor version of a solar panel that also sequesters some carbon temporarily if you replace livestock with it.

It gets lumped in with liquid biofuels and virgin forest burning which are both terrible though,",2

either way it's literally an amount that is a non-issue and goes away with decarbonization of transportation, steel production, and i think they even have a way to decarbonize concrete production.",1
technology,1glz2zx,Drought is hampering hydro generation by double-digit percentages in the U.S. this year,"Life extension is not really that typical for nuclear.

>40% of nuclear plants constructed are already shut down, and most of those shut down before 30 years (often at -2 to 0 years).

The existing trend would have to reverse significantly for the third or so of reactors under 30 to say life extension for nuclear is typical. Which seems exceedingly unlikely given that VRE + battery is approaching the cost of fuel.

Carbon free concrete is real-ish. We'll likely see it in wind decades before nuclear.

The easiest solution for wind is just prefab modular wind foundations. Remove 80% of the concrete in the wind foundation which is only there for mass and not strength, then replace it with dirt or rocks. This also makes carbon free concrete more realistic (as it ironically needs to be cured in a high CO2 environment).

None of this changes that 90% of the emissions from nuclear are unrelated to the island or containment, so you shouldn't suggest that they are (otherwise it can look like disinfo and feed the narrative). Point to deisel based mining or SO2 emissions from leaching/millingnfluids or energy in the russian enrichment system or emissions from sourcing HF for UF6 or copper in final contaijment if you must.",3

technology,1gleyir,Children under 16 to be banned from using social media,"I think you already know how. 

The **only** way to enforce this is for platforms to verify users by asking them to submit their IDs alongside with the photo. That or China style national internet id. Obviously, it's a very stupid solution. Obviously, it will actually lead to being heavily exploitable. And obviously if it's going to pass it will pass in this very skewed fashion.

PM of Australia has already said before that [rules of math do not apply in Australia](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140747-laws-of-mathematics-dont-apply-here-says-australian-pm/) after all.

Admittedly an actual solution is difficult. Not impossible per se but it requires educating parents, not children. Build a good and robust parental control software, offer it for free, teach parents how to use it, make it auto-block all social media by default (with ability to disable it of course). Will it stop kids from accessing these sites altogether? No. Will it reduce the scope of the problem? Drastically so. Especially if you were to also push platforms to start removing any ""child-oriented"" content so they would be less interesting to visit.

I would also consider the fact that while large scale social media is damaging the same cannot be said about smaller localized communities. Something has to replace the void that potentially removing Facebook/Twitter/TikTok etc would create. Such something existed in the past - small local forums, powered by the magic of PHPBB and equivalents. There's nothing wrong with a forum made for a single school class so they can share homework information for instance. The problem is that this kind of law doesn't reach past ""let's ban X"".

Funny thing is I am not even against the ban itself. If we could magically detect ""this is a kid using a computer, they are below 16, they want to go to Facebook"" then locking it... you know what, it kinda makes sense. But I am afraid we can't do that. So it's effectively a censorship law pretending to be about kids.",19

technology,1gleyir,Children under 16 to be banned from using social media,"Donald Trump is the only president in American history to attempt to overthrow the results of a free and fair election. In 2020, Trump declared victory before the vote count was complete, and then, 


# when it became clear that he had lost, he refused to accept the election results. He pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election


Trump himself has been found guilty of 34 felony charges in a trial that took place earlier this year over falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to adult actress Stormy Daniels as part of a scheme to influence the 2016 election. Additionally, he still faces three more felony indictments. Quite a few of his allies have also had criminal charges brought against them, including Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Michael Cohen.  


He has also praised Elon Musk for allegedly firing striking workers and bragged about not paying employees overtime. 


In office, Trump enabled corporations to amass more money and power at the expense of working people. He cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which led to a boom in corporate stock buybacks instead of ""trickling down."" **His administration also rolled back over 100 environmental regulations and deregulated food safety.***


The way that Trump talks about and treats women is, unfortunately, old news. From the infamous ""grab them by the pussy"" tape to the 27 allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Trump's words and actions show that he sees women as a means to his own sexual pleasure and little else. His choice of J.D. Vance, who seemingly can't stop saying weird things about women, as his running mate shows that sexism continues to be part of the Trump agenda.",1

technology,1gl3tgh,What a Trump win means for the FCC and telecom policy,"There is some positive here. USF does mean bills will go up, since USF exists on our telephone bills but not on Internet. If they manage to pull this off correctly, and help fund Fiber development to EVERYONE, rural, suburban, and urban, then that is a net positive for all. Our communications infrastructure is in fact falling apart, and the fact that people even consider 5G or Starlink as a viable primary Internet connection over Coaxial or Fiber Infrastructure is absolutely insane. While the USF does still benefit people, it has long been suspected/found to be lining the pockets  of Telecoms who don't need more money, so there needs to be hard restrictions on what the funds can go for. Which is again, Fiber, and getting Fiber to unserved areas. Not for shareholders. No data caps or throttling. No stupid AUP disconnects because you stream too much video. New York does something similar with state allocated funds for broadband expansion, and it has been instrumental in bringing Fiber into un-served areas. I have seen the results of it locally, and they have forced Spectrum to actually deploy Fiber instead of Coax, and to help smaller companies like Armstrong to build a modern network into deep mountainous areas.

As for the Rip and Replace project. Also valid concerns. Overblown (as of right now), but valid. Also a lot of tit-for-tat, because of US-made equipment being bugged on the way to other countries, so it's a case of reaping what you sow I guess. I think there are still a lot of efforts going on to remove Huawei equipment from smaller mobile networks, but held back by financial issues. However, something like this must also impact their spying apparatus. That means, no more using hardware from Israeli companies to unlock phones and wiretap networks, because that stuff is also super risky!

For the designation of risky companies, yeah, that's going to be a mess. The WeChat ban still needs to go through (has been mum for a while). The TikTok ban still hasn't happened yet. Are there alternatives to those who need WeChat to communicate with family or friends? Is there a viable replacement to TikTok that is actually good? Will the removal of Section 230 protections also apply to anything related to government or campaign operations? Are we actually going to focus on information security and data retention to reduce liability? What about all of the mess that is being caused by robots and AI?

It’s not really Trump we should be worried about. It’s the billionaires in the shadows and the foreign interest groups. It’s people like the Heritage Foundation, Thiel, the Koch network, Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc. Everything’s for sale now. Public lands, America, your health. All up for grabs.

I wanted Harris to win however I do think people need to realize that despite trump winning he can't do what people are thinking he might due to the fact we have the 22nd amendment. So to continue onward 

To answer your question on whats stopping him that is very easily answered. The States. I am not sure if you are familiar with the process of amending the constitution But below is something i quickly googled to illiterate my point. Below are all the ways to amend the constitution and you will quickly see as you read them why it is practically impossible to do any of these things due to the deep division in the united states currently. 

  
1. Proposed by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. Twenty-six of the twenty-seven amendments have been added this way.

  
The GOP would need 290 Votes to even being this process in the house and there is no way they would be able to gain enough democratic votes to process this process.  AND LETS SAY they had 290.  3/4 of all 50 states would then need to agree which means they would need several big key blue states to agree. So not going to happen

2. Proposed by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then ratified by specially called ratifying conventions in at least three-fourths of the states. This has happened once when the Twenty-First Amendment repealed Prohibition.

Agin HUGE HUGE hurdles to climb and they would need 2/3 of both houses which they don't have currently and once again the biggest hurdle being they still need 3/4 of all 50 states to agree. 

3. Proposed at a constitutional convention called by at least two-thirds of the states, then ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.

Self explanatory but no way any blue states going along with getting rid of the 22nd amendment. 

4. Proposed at a constitutional convention called by at least two-thirds of the states, then ratified by specially called ratifying conventions in at least three-fourths of the states.

technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,"Imagine a big cloud of dust particles with some small thermal energy. Because things are moving around, they're bouncing off each other which will sometimes produce radiation (photons). As this happens, the dust will begin to collapse in to a central region. This is aided by the fact that dark matter also forms gravitational wells or ""halos"". So far, no spinning, right?

But remember, at the beginning, all the dust particles were moving randomly. On average, there will be some small net angular velocity. That is, the cloud will be, approximately rotating. Then, as it collapses down, since angular momentum is conserved, as the radii decrease, the angular velocities must increase. This happens on the scale of galaxies but also solar systems and planets.

This is the same effect as spinning in an office chair with your legs out and then pulling them in towards the center to spin faster. Try it, it's fun and can help you understand some of the weirdness of angular momentum. A better example actually is the formation of tornadoes and hurricanes in the atmosphere.",37
technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,"Gravity in simple terms. As things combine, they make more gravity, more gravity means more things impacting the big thing. Some of that velocity is imparted onto the big thing by making it spin. Eventually the spin averages out and it pulls the small stuff into the same plane of the spin. Then it all just feedback loops until its mostly stable.",9
technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,I think the easiest visualization is how a figure skater can spin really fast by pulling their body in tighter around the axis of their spin.,2
technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,"Imagine two clouds of dust hit each other in space. Unless all the specs of dust hit each other absolutely dead-on they will always create a bit of spin. One will spin left and one will spin right.

In space, there is no friction to slow the spinning down, so they keep spinning. More bits of dust collide and bump and eventually you have a very large cloud of dust spinning clockwise and another cloud spins counter clockwise, and they both drift apart. This happens for millions of years until you have two very large clouds all spinning roughly the same way. 

Now here’s the important bit: when those specs of dust clump together and form rocks and planets and stars, they’re still spinning. In fact, they spin *faster* because they’re ’concentrating’ the spinning motion. It’s a bit like when a gymnast pulls their arms and legs in during a spin - they speed up because all that spinning (angular momentum) is concentrated into a smaller space.

In the case of this neutron star, all the momentum of an entire star is concentrated on something only 15km across, so it spins like a demon. Because stars, planets and galaxies all form largely the same way, they all spin.",3
technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,"Think of it this way: an asteroid is on a near collision course with earth, but misses by a fair amount. As it moves past earth afterwards, the gravity of the earth starts pulling it back. If the conditions are right & the gravity from earth is enough to prevent the asteroid from escaping, the asteroid falls back. 

If it misses Earth on the way back, at that point it’s in orbit. It will continuously be pulled back towards Earth, miss, move away, fall back, miss, etc. Now you have one mass revolving about another.  

Now apply that to a mass/cloud of tiny particles instead. Assuming the combined gravitational force from all the matter is enough to prevent the particles from escaping, they will all eventually “fall back” and orbit around its center of mass.  

Since stars & planets all original form from dense “clouds” of small particles/atoms, they all will naturally spin.",1

technology,1gliv44,Scientists just found a mind-boggling object in deep space | Mashable,"To answer this question, we need to calculate the speed of the neutron star's surface and compare it to the speed of light. Let's break it down step by step:

    Diameter of the neutron star: 7.5 miles (12 kilometers)
    Radius: 3.75 miles (6 kilometers)
    Rotation: 716 times per second

First, we need to calculate the circumference of the neutron star: Circumference = 2 * π * radius Circumference ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 3.75 miles ≈ 23.56 miles

Now, we can calculate the speed of the surface: Speed = Circumference * Rotations per second Speed ≈ 23.56 miles * 716 ≈ 16,869 miles per second

The speed of light is approximately 186,282 miles per second.

To express the surface speed in terms of light speed: Surface speed / Speed of light ≈ 16,869 / 186,282 ≈ 0.0905 or about 9.05% of the speed of light

Therefore, based on the information provided in the uploaded document, the surface of this neutron star is moving at approximately 9.05% of the speed of light.",4

I assume you mean reflective like a well polished ball.

From an optical perspective, a surface is rough and will be less shiny if the irregularities are bigger than the wavelength of light. Optical wavelengths are a few hundred nanometers. An atom is in the order of a few nanometers. So even when there are a few dozen atoms scattered in piles on a surface it will appear perfectly flat, optically. So if you now make it smoother, not only on an atomic scale but on a million times smaller scale, it doesn't change anything from an optically flat surface. So while the surface is likely much smoother than any normal matter object, that smoothness is not optically relevant.

However, interaction of matter with light, in particular reflection, is primarily governed by interactions with electrons. What the interaction of light with degenerate neutron matter looks like we can only guess.

I know it's fun to piss on Jack Welch, but he didn't invent any of this. Companies were beholden to their shareholders before. There were plenty of layoffs, mergers and funny business with the books.

This is the nature of public ownership of companies. Always has been. And before that it was the nature of private ownership of companies too.

My mom had cancer and stayed in my guest room and there was a sickly sweet smell that lasted for months after she was gone it( back to her own home not dead) I don’t know if that was treatment or something else.  I do think it would be possible for a dog to detect a smell we exhaled when we had lung cancer. ",1

technology,1glbsl2,Trudeau government bans TikTok from operating in Canada — but Canadians can still use it," I just read it, and realized I missed a very important point. It seems the Canadian government wants anyone who posts to any site, not just TikTok, to be extremely careful as to what he or she says in that post, but it has not actually banned anyone from using TikTok, at least not yet, as I said in my post. 

Children and teenagers, especially, must be extremely careful of what they post to TikTok, if in fact they are even allowed to post to that site at all. Does TikTok have specific age limits, for instance not allowing posts from anyone under a certain age?

 I am not certain, but I think Reddit does have such age limits, as should any social media website. Children under a certain age, in my opinion, should not post to these sites, as they have not lived long enough to know a lot about such subjects as politics or government; after all, this is why they are in school. If they do post to any social media website, they should have their parents read the post first, before it is put online; remember, once a post is put online, it cannot be removed from the site to which it was posted.",0

I don't think his voice stood out much in the sea of random product tie ins, child like horniness towards female characters, fantasy elements like characters that could harness lightning, telekinesis etc. 

Apparently  kojima never liked Hayter and wasn't particularly involved in the English language voice recordings, but you can't deny a massive portion of your fan base is English speaking and saw Hayter as an icon of the series. 

I think Kojima is just a bit hot and cold, obsesses with people then drops them like a sack of potatoes. He was all over Stephanie Joosten, the voice actor for Quiet, supposedly promised her the role of Fragile in Death Stranding - but then he got a ""real actor"" with Lea Seydoux and ghosted Joosten.

technology,1gm8n0w,Ensuring a bright future for diamond electronics and sensors by perfecting the growth process,"Quantum chemistry model of surface reactions and kinetic model of diamond growth: Effects of CH3 radicals and C2H2 molecules at low-temperatures CVD - Nov 2024

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925963524007908?via%3Dihub

> Abstract 

> The objective of this study is to explore conditions that facilitate a significant reduction in substrate temperature during diamond growth. 

> The typical temperature for this process is around 1200 K; we aim to reduce it to a much lower level. 

> To achieve this, we need to understand processes that limit the diamond growth at low temperatures. 

> Therefore, we developed a detailed chemical kinetic model to analyze diamond growth on the (100) surface. 

> This model accounts for variations in substrate temperature and gas composition. 

> Using an ab initio quantum chemistry, we calculated the reaction rates of all major gas phase reactants with the diamond surface, totaling 91 elemental surface reactions. 

> Based on this comprehensive model, we developed a reduced model consisting of 8 reactions. 

> This reduction enabled us to derive an analytical equation that describes the rate of diamond growth across a broad range of temperatures involving CH3, H, H2, and C2H2 reactants. 

> Consistent with previous studies, the model identifies that CH3 is a major precursor of diamond growth, and the contribution from C2H2 to the growth is significantly smaller. 

> However, C2H2 can also contribute to forming a sp2-phase instead of a sp3-phase, and this process becomes dominant below a critical temperature. 

> As a result, C2H2 flux inhibits diamond growth at low temperatures.

> To quantify this deleterious process, we developed a new mechanism for sp2-phase nucleation on the (100) surface. 

> Similar to the so-called HACA mechanism for soot formation it involves hydrogen abstraction and C2H2 addition.

> Consequently, optimal low-temperature CVD growth could be realized in a reactor designed to maximize the CH3 radical production, while minimizing the generation of C2H2 and other sp. and sp2 hydrocarbons.",2

IMO ChatGPT was a temporary, descriptive name for a proof-of-concept that blew up way too quickly.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they eventually lose the trademark someday. OpenAI already tried trademarking the term GPT, which was rightfully denied for obvious reasons, but it also would have cemented their ChatGPT trademark if it had been approved, which was likely their intent.

Their ChatGPT trademark is really weak from a trademark law perspective, since it’s just a GPT (technical term) trained on conversation (chat), hence Chat+GPT.

Technical Sounding: The name is quite technical and could feel alienating to people unfamiliar with AI or tech jargon. “GPT” is an acronym for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” which might not resonate or convey meaning to a general audience.

2.	Lacks Personality: The name “ChatGPT” emphasizes “chat” and “GPT,” which don’t create an emotional connection. For a product intended for personal interaction, a name that feels warmer or more relatable could help foster trust and interest.

3.	Limited Scope: By focusing on “Chat,” the name implies it’s solely for conversation, potentially limiting the perceived scope of what it can do (e.g., generating ideas, assisting with coding, or providing summaries). A name that implies versatility might be better.

4.	Branding and Differentiation: “ChatGPT” sounds more like a technology feature than a standalone brand. Stronger product names usually create an identity that sticks out and is easy to remember, like “Siri” or “Alexa,” both of which are unique and humanized.

	5.	Difficult to Pronounce and Remember: Acronyms, especially those not well-known, can be harder for the average person to remember or talk about, which is a hurdle for word-of-mouth marketing.",-8

technology,1gl91yn,Huawei trying to poach TSMC employees with 3X salary,"That makes sense.  
Our perspectives are different.  
   
I run a large hardware and asic engineering team that builds complex things. We all need to work very closely together to make sure the team doesn’t screw up.   We invest years of long hours to build what we build.  It is a miracle it all works in the end (and the last 5% of fixes is agony).   

It’s a brutally hard profession, but merit-based so it is a pirate crew of scruffy people, rough-edged personalities and many ESL immigrants (mostly in fact, including me).   We regularly work 60+ hour weeks and sometimes 70-80 during sprints.  
   
I am not sure what I will say to my daughter if she expresses a desire to follow my path.  I will be very real with her what it costs.  
   
That said, working closely with people for years breeds a fierce sense of esprit de corps.  Even though we are intensely data-driven engineers, we have to trust each other to do our parts because if one fails, the team fails.  People help others without haggling so the team finishes on time.  
   
We all have families who rely on the fruit of our labor to eat and thrive.  I live to build my daughter’s future.  
   
When industrial espionage was happening in our profession, that trust was broken.  I was still young and it hurt me deeply.  I now work much harder because my elders sold out our advantages for a few coins, ignoring that it would curse us to longer hours going forward.

You need a device that is completely independent from phones/tablets/pcs in order for it to have a chance, and it has to be something that everyone has a reason to own.

The Apple Watch is pretty much the only device they have that could fit that category, except there's not much of a reason to own one unless you're a fitness nut in most cases, and aside from the rabid apple diehards, most people wont be willing to pay that much when they could get something like a Fitbit.

Make it so the console gets popular like nintendo switch. So the new games come not only for pc, ps4/5 , xbox s/x, Nintendo switch, but also for the ""apple one"" console.

These products have opened new markets and generated significant revenue, proving that innovation can still thrive without a singular visionary at the helm.

The company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing user privacy are examples of forward-thinking strategies that align with modern consumer values. And while a new product like an “Apple One” handheld console is an interesting idea, it’s also essential to consider market saturation and competition. The gaming console market is highly competitive, and entering it would require significant investment and risk.

By making it simple to use and connecting it with iTunes, Jobs turned the iPod into a cultural phenomenon that put ‘1,000 songs in your pocket’ and changed how we listened to music.

Then he did it again with the iPhone, not just by creating a smartphone, but by envisioning it as a handheld computer that could seamlessly integrate with apps, music, photos, and the internet. Apps are indeed a huge part of the iPhone’s success, but it was Jobs’ vision for a device that brought everything together in a sleek, intuitive way that made it a hit. He showed that people don’t just adopt new tech—they embrace tech that simplifies, enhances, and transforms daily life.

While it’s hard to imagine what could surpass the iPhone, Jobs proved that by solving real problems and creating a great experience, a new tech product can feel indispensable.

AVP didn't share that same appeal and even if it did own a fraction of the potential market could afford it.

Is it great? No. It is pricey. It is too heavy. And right now they've done very little to create functionality that users demand. In that way it really is like the Lisa. A niche product, even one only for experimenters or developers. One that is large and expensive. But it does show a big part of what would be successful if it could be done more affordably and smaller. That's how it's like the Lisa. Or for that matter the first iPad.

It's not hot garbage. It's just a non-viable product due to the current hardware limitations and cost of even getting that hardware into a box.

I think you really missed what the video is about.

Will Apple end up ""cashing in"" on what Vision Pro promises? It's hard to say. For me it's even harder to say yes. It's just really hard to see how the average user will need a VR headset at all.

But same thing happened with the iPad. It was widely seen as a ""third screen"". If you already have a phone and a computer and have money burning in your pocket then maybe get this. Tablets were so disdained that Android made a special version of Android just for it (Honeycomb) and didn't really put a whole lot into that. It worked like crap and the hardware made by most companies worked like crap. Makers of tablets by and large exited the market, leaving pretty much only Apple and Samsung. Then Amazon got in too.

And then things started to reverse. Tablets found their market and now they sell a lot of them. They have started to *replace* computers for a substantial number of people (not a majority, by far).

Like I said, I can't forsee anything like that for VR helmets. But I guess it's possible.

> If you run a simple C/C++ compiler as a developer to build your app without specifically parameterizing it, it will use your machine's CPU instruction set as the target

Most Mac apps are made with Apple's compiler. It was emitting ARM code about a year before Apple even shipped ARM Macs to customers (they leased units to developers ahead of time). And Apple's compiler did not by default emit AVX. You could turn it on, but it used SSE as a default. See CLANG_X86_VECTOR_INSTRUCTIONS at the link below for a somewhat oblique reference to this not being on by default.  I also believe it doesn't target your exact CPU by default. The default is set by OS release basically . It does select your CPU in a broad way (x86_64 or ARM) but not your extensions, as far as I know. I know targeting your CPU is the common case on UNIX and other platforms but Apple does some things differently and this is one thing they control differently. So yes, you can make an app that doesn't work. But it's nothing like you make it out to be.

Define ""app"". Afaik. it is just a synonym for any software application that runs on the system.

Maybe you mean ""programs installed from Apple's App store""? If so, that's misleading. Almost every single program I use is from **outside** their app store. Productivity apps like IDEs, desktop extensions, editors, office tools, chat apps, etc. are all outside their app store.

Not in software engineering spaces. Most programs I use are from Github and are cross-compiled, often by build systems that are not run on MacOS.

Right. I say app because you said ""any program"". Not every program is an app. Rosetta 2 is only for apps.

I'm not sure what a desktop extension is. It sounds like not an app. If it's not an app it isn't covered. All those other things are. And they run. And the vast majority did before Apple even released ARM Macs to customers, because they (as I mentioned) released them to developers significantly in advance of customer release.

> Not in software engineering spaces.

You're mistaken.

> Most programs I use are from Github and are cross-compiled, often by build systems that are not run on MacOS.

The programs I use from github and the ones put on git hub are not cross compiled. Even the cross-platform ones. Things like KiCAD (an example, it's not actually on github but gitlab)? The Mac versions are compiled on Mac.

> You've got to be joking if you think needing to download zip files and run .sh executables yourself to even enable an experimental support is ""perfect"" emulation.

So you didn't look? Because according to that there's nothing to turn on. That link is people who wanted to use the Sequoia support on pre-Sequoia OSes. If you have Sequoia it just works. At least according to what I read.

> I'll look at it in a few years when they maybe release it as GA

""GA"" was in Sequoia and Sequoia came out two months ago. You really gotta back off from your ""fact"" claim if you won't even read the link provided well enough to see what it says, let alone look for yourself to see if AVX support was released with Sequoia.

I really don't know where you're coming from but it isn't trying to set anything straight. You're just making up wrong stuff. Why is it so important you get across that Rosetta 2 doesn't work when it does? When it does even for AVX starting 2 months ago? How did it become so important you get out this (now wrong) info, more important than actually ensuring the information was correct? Who comes out ahead from you doing this? Anyone?

> Cross compilation is a thing.

Unfortunately, that response doesn't fit what I was asking.

Here's what I asked:

> (you) and 99% of developers running x86 hardware have AVX on their laptop, whether it's MacOS, Linux or Windows.

>> (me) What does any of this have to do with other than MacOS?

Why does it matter what developers who are using other than MacOS are using on their laptop? Rosetta 2 runs on MacOS, not those other things. Why does it matter what Rosetta 2 can emulate on platforms it doesn't run on?

It doesn't have anything to do with cross compilation, it's about where Rosetta 2 runs.

> and I'm pretty sure lots of Github projects don't.

You should have looked. It can be done, but it's rare. Partly because of Apple's signing requirements, packaging requirements, etc. Apple uses Mach-o, nearly everyone else uses ELF (linux) or StandardPE (Windows). It's hard to make an app for Mac and not compile it on Mac. Can it be done? Yes. Is it usually done by Github projects? No.

I think the issue here is you don't understand Apple actually planned ahead on this. In a way it seems Microsoft maybe didn't do. They squeezed everyone onto their tools. They controlled what their tools emitted to maximize forward compatibility. On iOS they even forbid developers to use anything but Apple's compiler for a while (this was eventually ended).

technology,1gl7iri,The Secret System Behind Every Call You Make Is About to Change Hands,"Seems like a pretty easy fix, assuming you can get congress to do it.  Simply pass a law, or amend existing laws, with language that specifically empower regulatory agencies to expand regulations to meet current needs and technologies within the purview of the agency's scope and mandate, with the exception of explicitly contradicting the letter of existing laws/regulations. 

That is to say, the FCC *can* expand regulations to include authority and whatnot over new technologies within their realm unless the regulations they are attempting to impose directly contradict what's actually in the law. 

Then, if congress wants to control regulations or restrict regulation on something, they have to pass laws that do those things. 

That way, there's no issue caused by the separation of powers as Congress, who are solely granted the power to make laws according to the constitution, is officially granting authority to those agencies and delegating limited rights to expand the law/interpretation of the law to those agencies, which is within the power of Congress to do.",8

technology,1glqyuc,"Matter 1.4 tries to set the smart home standard back on track | The new spec brings much-needed fixes for interoperability and Thread network issues, along with new device types, including Wi-Fi routers, heat pumps, and solar panels","Some key points below:

>However, the launch of the Matter 1.4 specification this week shows some signs that the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA, the organization behind Matter) is using more sticks and fewer carrots to get the smart home industry coalition to cooperate.  
>
>The new spec introduces “enhanced multi-admin,” an improvement on multi-admin — the much-touted interoperability feature that means your Matter smart light can work in multiple ecosystems simultaneously. It brings a solution for making Thread border routers from different companies play nicely together and introduces a potentially easier way to add Matter infrastructure to homes through Wi-Fi routers and access points.
>
>Arguably, these should have all been in place when Matter launched. But now, two years later, the CSA is finally implementing the fixes that could help move the standard forward.
>
>Matter 1.4 also brings some big updates to energy management support, including adding heat pumps, home batteries, and solar panels as Matter device types.
>
>Disappointingly, security cameras didn’t make it in this time. The CSA’s CTO, Chris LaPré, tells The Verge that while support for cameras is still part of the plan, there’s no timeline for a release. However, he points out that with 1.4, Matter now covers almost every other device category in the home. Which should provide a solid foundation to move the standard forward.
>
>...
>
>One of Matter’s main promises is interoperability between platforms — if your smart plug is Matter-compatible, it will work with Apple Home, Alexa, Google Home, et al. But multi-admin, as this is called, stumbled out of the gate. Not only were there frequent setup frustrations for users when trying to pair a device from one ecosystem to another, but each ecosystem has a different flow and naming convention for the process, making it hard to figure out. It’s almost like they didn’t want you to use it.
>
>Now, “enhanced multi-admin” aims to fix this by automatically adding a Matter device you pair to your main platform to any other smart home platform you’ve authorized. Daniel Moneta, the CSA's marketing chair, explains that this is enabled by something called Fabric Sync, which allows you to authorize different Fabrics (the name for an ecosystem in Matter) to talk to each other.

It's good to see some further developments on this standard, and hopefully adoption by the industry will be sufficient to make this a useful one for end users. Having a useful standard that allows for device interoperability will be beneficial to those setting up these systems as it gives them flexibility with the vendors and devices that they might want to use.",8

technology,1gkyyow,"Google has no duty to refund gift card scam victims, judge finds","Usually, CC companies, Zelle, banks, etc differentiate between ""fraudulent activity"" where transactions are made without authorization and the scams where the stuff is being legitimately paid for by the cardholder/account holder but they're being tricked into it. There are a lot of protections in place for situations where transactions are made without authorization, but laws and policies are still kind of catching up to scams like this where the person is (occasionally very insistently) making authorized transactions on their own accounts but under false pretenses.

But yes, there could be more protections on this and I'd imagine sooner or later there will be, especially if companies are held more accountable for it. In general I feel like people falling for dumb and easily researchable scams are ultimately responsible for their own choices and actions even as victims, but like you said there could be more mitigations. People haven't typically had too much sympathy for, say, people buying ""overstock speakers"" out of the back of vans that turn out to be junk/fake, or giving money to fake beggars, even if they're technically victims too and this is just another example of having some street wisdom.

That said, a lot of these scams are multilayered with mules and other people tricked into things, like the check deposit/money forwarding people who are actually laundering stolen money without being aware of it. If there aren't already people being tricked into doing it, it wouldn't be hard to set up a ""work from home"" job scam where a person redeems gift card codes and forwards the cash places (or buys things with it and ships them places, where maybe another layer of the scam sells/returns them), maybe getting to keep some percentage of each as their salary or bonus. So it may be difficult to geographically block these. And with botnets and VPNs it would even potentially be difficult to flag, say, someone redeeming $40k of gift cards all at once from the same place.",2

If you mean the card's specific brand owner, then I'd say maybe a bit more but still limited. Like you said they're just another substitute for cash and aren't sold intending to be any sort of safer alternative (like, for example, the old American Express Traveller's Cheques that were specifically intended to be an insured way to travel with decent amounts of money). I don't mind and figure they probably should have a bit better fraud detection, like a wad of gift cards bought in the US being redeemed in China, but at some point if they're going to provide a service and a person is going to go out of their way to bypass the protections already in place I'm not sure how much more card providers can even do. Potentially something like region lock gift cards to prevent them from being redeemed out of their area but that might hinder some legitimate uses. And it probably wouldn't be too terribly difficult to set up botnets or mules to redeem them in-region anyway.

I'm generally somewhat against gift cards as a concept, really - by and large they only exist because society frowns on direct money gifts and gift cards are a way to give someone money a step removed.

But if the gift card remains unspent, that company should give it back to the victim and cancel the gift card. In this case, everyone is made whole and returned to their original state. 

Clawing back their money from the gift card company would be like the victim demanding money from the bicycle shop—this makes no sense. If whoever purchased the bicycle from the thief must return it to the original owner, then same goes for gift cards.",0

If a thief scammed a gift card from you and then used it to buy a tv from best buy, why shouldn’t you be able to reclaim your money from best buy?

Again, if someone stole a bicycle from you, no one is going to reimburse you a new bicycle (ignoring insurance for a second). The bicycle shop is not going to give you a new one. But, and this happens today ALL the time, if you find out that someone purchased the bike from the thief and you can prove the bicycle is yours, you are legally allowed to reclaim your bicycle from them. And the only way for that person to get their money back is to find the thief or whoever stole it from them. 

And again, I’m not saying that the gift card issuer is on the hook here. I’m saying that whoever accepted the scammed gift card money is on the hook, similar to whoever purchased the stolen bike.

The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is developing a comprehensive network of spy satellites built by SpaceX to provide continuous global surveillance. This enhancement will improve the NRO's ability to monitor adversaries in near real-time. 

Unlike the previous approach, which relied on a few expensive, giant satellites, this new ""proliferated architecture"" will consist of at least 100 small satellites, utilising SpaceX's Starlink production capabilities. The expanded network aims to decrease the time it takes to revisit and image specific areas, thereby improving responsiveness and resilience, particularly in the face of potential satellite attacks.

technology,1gl4hfm,Narrative Intelligence: Detecting Chinese and Russian Information Operations to Disrupt NATO Unity ,"TLDR 

The article discusses how Russia and China utilise information operations to spread narratives that divide NATO and undermine Western interests, particularly in conflicts like the one in Ukraine. These countries exploit social media, state media, and proxy outlets to influence public opinion, create distrust, and diminish support for U.S. policies. 


Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and AI-based analysis, or narrative intelligence (NARINT), play a crucial role in detecting and countering these tactics.

technology,1gl4hfm,Narrative Intelligence: Detecting Chinese and Russian Information Operations to Disrupt NATO Unity ,"As geopolitical conflicts are increasingly shaped by misleading and deceptive information, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has become an indispensable tool in understanding adversarial information operations and being able to compete in the information environment. Noting the value of OSINT, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently published a framework for the intelligence community to leverage commercially available information. Competition in the information environment among major powers is not new or unique. Today, Russia and China strategically employ information operations as part of their attempts to undermine US interests. China has actively used information operations to generate favorable strategic outcomes in Africa. Russian and Chinese messaging is also aligned in exploiting how the Israel-Hamas conflict is characterized. In this competition space, the distinction between signal and noise is more heightened than ever. As the volume of data increases, so does the challenge of identifying what matters — the relevant information that can be synthesized into actionable intelligence. This makes OSINT crucial for tracking and analyzing security threats as well as for monitoring the ebb and flow of online narratives that can influence public opinion and shape national security policy.

Derived primarily from online content published by malign actors, narrative intelligence (NARINT) is an increasingly critical tool of OSINT analysis. It refers to the study and analysis of disinformation and propaganda surfaced on social media platforms, news sites, internet forums, blogs, and the dark web. By thoroughly assessing these materials, analysts can gain a clearer understanding of the narrative tactics foreign entities are using to create hostile divisions and erode basic trust in the nation’s institutions. NARINT is particularly critical to detect, analyze, and compete against adversarial information operations that attempt to undermine US national security interests. It can parse through news, blogs, forums, social media, the dark web, digital broadcasts, and other sources to provide insights that are critical for early indications and warnings. Moreover, it can show how narratives shift and affect public sentiments and opinions about conflicts.",5

This follows the EU’s €1.84 billion (around $2 billion) fine imposed on Apple in March. After investigating a complaint from Spotify, the EU Commission ruled that Apple restricted developers’ ability to point users to cheaper purchases outside the App Store in March — a practice that’s illegal under the DMA.

To expand on this a bit, the only reason these bubbles occur is because private equity/VC's are pouring shitloads of money into these companies, which means these companies can hire and expand super fast and just continue build momentum for the hype-train. But like you said, when people start to realize that these AI tools aren't all they cracked up to be the companies will start losing customers/revenue and the investors will stop pouring all this money in.

The second that VC's/PE think their money is at risk they will cash out. At that point the companies will collapse (you need money coming in one way or another) and it will sort of be a domino effect as more investors cash out and more companies collapse. Thus the bubble bursts, the market crashes, and tons of people lose their jobs. It will be a mess.

The investors and execs will be fine, they have golden parachutes, but the employees of those companies will be standing there holding a bunch of useless 'equity' in the shitty start-up they were working for, no job and nowhere to go because all the competitors just went out of business too.

You're partially answering your own question right here. You're saying that LLMs have made you more productive in writing SQL and regexes. What's cheaper, paying a senior dev to write basic SQL queries and regexes, or have a junior do it with the help of an LLM? Sure, if you want highly optimized stuff then you pay a senior, but the point here is that you can find marginal productivity gains by giving juniors an AI assistant.

Extend this beyond your job. How many non-tech people need to interact with tech on a daily basis? Everyone in the business world struggling with excel formulas, text editors, powerpoint, BI interfaces, other various business software.

By the time it's actually at the 'write the code' step sure, it could be handed off to basically anyone, including probably an LLM- except you don't hire junior engineers specifically for productivity. you hire them so you can have senior engineers in the future.

indian devs arent inherently more or less skilled, what they are is cheaper. massively cheaper.

right but i'm moreso contesting the valuation. >3T nvidia... yet where are the X00B revenue AI based companies? Is the productivity gain enough to mass layoff workers at big tech to move the needle? because you'd need to absolutely decimate headcount for that ot be the case.

>What's cheaper, paying a senior dev to write basic SQL queries and regexes,

anyone experienced with these things probably could've thrown them together in a few minutes.

>or have a junior do it with the help of an LLM?

but the point of having juniors around is mostly for the pipeline. if the junior can be more productive... okay, but that's not really the point. If the junior relies on LLMs for say SQL and regex what happens when they are asked to solve a problem with SQL and regex and they're basically starting from square 0.5 with their understanding because the LLM theyre using is not producing good results?

>Then you have the next tier, business or finance majors, people dealing with more advanced BI who probably did some in school but are nowhere near as proficient as an experienced dev. People who deal with minimal coding as part of their job. And on and on and on.

I mean i guess this is somewhat quantifiable productivity gains, I'm just really not seeing where the benefit of 'use the LLM' greatly exceeds... just plain competency. The front loaded cost of becoming competent is high, sure, but across a career is there actual productivity gain? The first SQL query might take me an hour or two, but that's because its not 'make the SQL query' but 'learn how SQL works AND make the query'

if all you end up with is considerably less capable workers (when LLMs fail) the long term gain is not actually good right?",1

They dig people into echo chambers and feed them ever more simplistic, ever more less nuanced ragebait. The information content becomes practically masturbatory in its rage, even to the exclusion of *correct* information, let alone *actionable* information.

Shit on Twitter all you like. Seriously, don't let me dissuade you from that at all. But why is no one talking about increasing the character count? ""Because that's just not what Twitter is""? Well then Twitter is built from the ground up to destroy nuanced conversation, even before getting to the algorithm. And on the topic of their algorithm, Facebook's is already publicly known to promote angry reactions 7× more than likes, and there's really no good reason to think Twitter doesn't similarly preferentially promote ragebait. Where's the conversation about forcing these companies to change their algorithm? Through the law if necessary. Or, beyond that, why are they able to train up algorithms whose purpose is to hack the psychology of its users while keeping the details of both the training data and the training goal private or even obfuscated? Because blah blah ""private property""?

And the N word. The broad notion being, “just let the marketplace of ideas decide what goes up and what goes down.” 

Replacing twitters moderation team with a single guy didn’t do anything to create a marketplace of ideas. It just changed the weights of the market to align with one persons principles, a person who has no sounding board.

I know that there is this campaign line of ""nuance"", but let's be real: the US has immense leverage over Israeli military operations that it is refusing to use. It has been _over a year_ now, with not only no concrete progress from Biden, but not even an indication of _what_ exactly they're negotiating over. We keep giving Israel more bombs, they keep committing atrocities, and the very bravest dems will say ""it's tragic that Hamas made them do that, but we must remember the victims of October 7th"". This is not a ""nuances"" stance, this is just semi-vocal support as opposed to plainly saying the same thing.

And the thing is, it would be _so fucking easy_ for Harris to say _anything_ substantial beyond ""we're working on a deal"" before turning back to fully supporting Israel, but for some reason she hasn't.

I think where we're differing is that I do not view ""getting A to win"" as the ultimate and only goal. The goal is good policy; getting a candidate to win is a proxy for that goal, but only as long as the candidate has a motivation to pursue good policy.

When the candidate can convince you that your goal *isnt* policy, but instead a party win-- then they have no reason to pursue good policy, as much as they have an incentive to win votes. This could be spending extra time campaigning (instead of doing their job), or it could be the blatant vote-buying handouts that we've increasingly seen over the last several years.

Whatever it ends up being, it's rather bad for policy, and my interests, and I'd rather take an approach to voting that punishes that and provides an incentive for them to win back my vote. In any event, *my* duty is to vote for a candidate that I can actually endorse and if I cannot do that with one of the major candidates I will not be bullied into doing so by some false, imposed obligation to stop the other guy from winning.

technology,1gkgiyb,"Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% staff, drops advocacy division.","It's time to fork Mozilla - we've been watching this decline for a while.

* Firefox has gone from nearly 30% marketshare to closer to 5% since its peak around 2008

* In 2020 Mozilla laid off 25% of its total workforce (about 250 employees) including its entire Servo (next generation browser engine) team and all engineers working on Rust (programming language).

* Since acquiring Pocket in 2017 Mozilla has incorporated an increasing amount of data collection, ads, and sponsored content into its products. Pocket was originally an optional extension that was then baked into Firefox and made very difficult to remove and its code was never open sourced.

The reality is that Mozilla is in rapid decline and unlikely to recover at this point. Its reliance on Google always meant that it at best had ""one foot in one foot out"" of corporate tech and has predictably been turned into something that is just a slightly less shitty but also considerably less profitable tech company, not a sustainable alternative to big tech.

In my opinion it is time that the open source community came together to ""fork"" Mozilla's ethos and its projects and give them a home in a new organization that is built to withstand the years and pressures of big tech.

I think the open source community has large and well financed orgs and listed a bunch of them including The Linux Foundation, Wikimedia, EFF and others.

To me, Mozilla was on par with The Linux Foundation in terms of doing fantastic work on a major project that is foundational to modern digital life. The web browser is as big or bigger than the kernel when it comes to importance to people's ability to use computers and the internet to benefit their lives.

Unfortunately, I think unlike The Linux Foundation which has managed steady, divdrse, and robust funding all these years, The Mozilla Foundation never expanded beyond its search engine deals with Google. So in that sense I don't know that they've ever really made the Mozilla Foundation a sustainable project that can truly challenge and provide alternative to big tech - it's effectively a back-drawer Google side project and we know how much they love to cancel their back-drawer side projects.",1

Forking a project is expensive. ""Open source community fork"" doesn't magically make everything possible. Especially something as complex as a browser. It's not a one person or even a one team job. It's a company job. 

That requires a LOT of money. You have provided absolutely no solution. You basically said the equivalent of ""can one of you people with a garage build a space ship so we can compete with Space X?""

So no, your plan to forget Firefox and just fork them is garbage. Unless you have a billion dollars for starters. Then it's worth talking about.",-3

technology,1gkgiyb,"Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% staff, drops advocacy division.",the issue with Manifest V3 is one particular limitation which I know some browsers are removing. I'd have to dig in to figure out if Vivaldi was also removing it.,-1
technology,1gkgiyb,"Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% staff, drops advocacy division.","> So it's not about blocking or not blocking adblocks, it's about maintaining a rather costly procedure to enable adblockers to work.

Manifest only affects plugins.

Manifest changes don't affect these browsers, not because they're maintaining older version of Manifest, but because their built in adblock is agnostic to it.

Besides, considering the two big Chromium browsers that people would be looking at (Brave and Opera) have so many features pumped into them that you don't really *need* plugins I don't think it's going to be hugely impactful to those making the jump.

What we need is the wider FOSS community to meaningfully invest in not just maintaining Firefox and Gecko, but actively developing and advancing browser technology to meaningfully compete with Google and Chromium.

I believe both Rust and Servo (former Mozilla projects) were incorporated into the Linux Foundation after Mozilla laid off their engineering teams who worked them. I think that could be a good home for forks of Firefox and Gecko if Mozilla adopts Chromium.

There's a reason a company with incredibly deep pockets, huge engineering teams, and the ability to bundle their browser as a default on Windows scrapped their layout engine (Trident).

It's because web browsers and layout engines are incredibly huge complicated pieces of tech. Maintaining marketshare and feature-parity with Chrome/Chromium is just an incredibly expensive endeavor. It is so much more profitable to just outsource that tech to Google so you can get users into your browser and then monetize their data. It's none of the overhead with all of the revenue.

Agree with most of your post but on this point it bears mentioning that this appeal is at most partially contributing to their less than 5% and dwindling market share. It's arguably the primary appeal to a user like me but it's just not enough to ensure that they can stay in the game.

We're creeping up on a downward spiral here because the less money and engineers they have to invest in Firefox the more it will lag behind Chrome in features which drives away users which drives away how much effort web developers put into testing and and supporting their site on Firefox which in turn makes the entire project less sustainable for Mozilla to continue development on.

As a user I see sites that tell me they don't support Firefox and that I should use Chrome or Edge. As a web developer Firefox's tech is consistently older and weirder and harder to get my sites working on.

I still use it and will advocate for it as long as it's not Chromium but I really think we need to admit there's a problem here, we could lose Firefox and Gecko and the open source community needs to start to work on solutions now rather than dragging our feet until worse news forces us to take action.",3

The WebUSB API comes to mind, so does the Picture-in-Picture API (To which Firefox eventually said ""fuck you"" and did their own thing, which is arguably better since websites can't just prevent you from using PiP if they don't like it).

Shouldnt the NSA, FBI, CIA, etc, be able to put those sort of accounts to a stop pretty quickly, especially when X is owned by Musk? Is there anything at all that points to China being involved with this that you can show me? Putin is just an oligarch puppet. I wonder which oligarchs are funding him?

It isn't government overreach to shut down foreign agents comitting malicious actions to influence the US population. That is the very purpose of those agencies. So if you ask me, the clearest answer to why it happens en-masse is that it is a domestic operation, with Russia and China being the scapegoat.

My points are logical, so if I'm a bot, what are you? You haven't provided any logical points to back up your claim of it being Russia/China, other than them being ""known to do that"", at which it applies to the US as well.

If you genuinely believe it is due to Russia or China, do you really think it's government overreach to be taking stronger action? Especially when these accounts are potentially negatively influencing the american population? Eliminating an online threat is much simpler and not nearly the same as striking a target with a missile.

As someone who lives in Corning, we tend to hear stuff about what goes on with gorilla glass. Everyone knows someone who works at Corning Inc. so rumors tend to spread, and at one point there was a story about Apple, who at one point left and started using Sapphire glass (remember the memes about dropping your iPhone an inch and the screen shattering?) Apparently Sapphire said they were just as good at a lower contract price. Apple met with Corning execs, and wanted to go back to gorilla glass. I wouldn't go as far as to say they're the best, but from my understanding companies are welcome to switch, just don't expect the same contract price if you go back to gorilla",2

Jesus wept. I have telecommuted since it was called ""telecommuting."" I always knew I had opportunities to take breaks whenever I wanted to, 2 hour lunches, quick shopping trips...provided my throughput was measurable, obvious, and made visible. This is the failing of the old-school ""gotta-be-in-view-at-all-times"" execs who think we sleep all day and it's all mouse jigglers. So: 

\- Ensure reporting, expectations, processes and tracking methods are all place, with whatever tools you use. You have the tools. Use them.  
\- Assign tasking. Simple or complicated: it's my job. Tell me what to do.   
\- If I am falling behind, I will provide status updates that clearly show why. Same with being ahead of schedule. If you're my boss, you'll be on calls, or get minutes, but you'll know and be aware if I was working a 5 hour task on a day with 6 hours of mandatory back-to-back meetings...including status calls that you might want to read the minutes of.  
\- Um. How can you not?  
\- Am I getting the job done?   
\- No? Uh oh. Hello unemployment.  
\- Yes? There you go!  
\- You have no way to measure throughput? Bummer. I mean, you will also have no way to measure throughput if I \*am\* sitting in your offices. 

We telecommuters get upset when the boss says ""I don't know what you're doing."" This shows a lack of trust, but that's irrelevant.

People saying RTO is some covert layoff are conspiratorial idiots, seriously. Amazon can fire or layoff anybody they want to at any time, they don’t need to do this roundabout approach which wouldn’t even make sense to begin with as there is a possibility that most people accept the new situation. It isn’t about “press”, the press is bad either way, and in fact, actually worse by RTO being the catalyst. 

I know you all like getting the pitch forks out for every possible thing, but again, if Amazon wanted to do layoffs or fire people, they would simply do that. Why would they take the route of least predictability and greatest resistance with the supposed RTO approach you all believe to be happening, and just hope for the best? They’re not idiots, they would take a systematic approach and make cuts if the end goal here was just simply lower headcount. 

They want people in the office. That’s their goal. If layoffs or fewer people was the goal, they would just layoff or fire low performers. They are undoibtly aware that this decision will result in some people leaving, but they’ve made the decision and accepted that the risk of some leaving does not outweigh the benefits of RTO.

Is it all one sided?  Of course not. CBD’s and small commercial businesses (in particular food and entertainment based) have suffered a lot from WFH.

technology,1gkhcvk,Amazon CEO denies full in-office mandate is 'backdoor layoff',"My contract (and for that matter, my entire team’s contracts) with Wondery was not renewed, and it expired 1 week after Jassy made the RTO announcement. I was encouraged to apply for positions on the Wondery team, of which I made it past the final interview for two positions. I confirmed with the hiring managers that my job could be done from home, and even provided work samples that “exceeded all expectations” (according to the hiring managers) that proved that not only could I do the job but that I could also do it well from my home office. 

Due to RTO, it was a requirement that Jassy himself signed off on my position remaining remote. I was told in no uncertain terms that a clear decision would be made in no more than two weeks and that paperwork was on his desk. I received no communication whatsoever. I inquired about why RTO was a high focus item for Wondery, to which the recruiter told me “I don’t know, I don’t understand it.”

The answer comes down to money. There is no money gained or lost directly by remote work (except for commute savings on the workers, and potentially lower healthcare costs), so the only answer is real estate. Amazon owns a ton of it, and going in utilized means they would need to sell. Real estate investments are considered some of the safest investments possible, and Amazon refuses to make decisions that will cost them.

Let's suppose you've invented some software that takes a very difficult problem requiring 100 teraflops and reduced it to 1. Certainly, this removes the need for quantum computers in some applications but 1:1 you've *also* increased every quantum computer by the same factor. Everything just gets better, faster, running more efficiently. These are not competing technologies: hardware and software evolve together.

**Every** problem described in this article was said about and can be applied to solid-state silicon gold transistor computers 70 years ago. The modern computer operating system has completely eliminated any need for the end user to worry about memory addressing (not size, literally assigning space for your inputs), hardware capability or drivers. Quantum computers today don't even have reliable firmware let alone a proper O/S that can compartmentalize programs away from the hardware, so the idea that this is going to stop them is ridiculous. This is what technology is. It's a circuitboard of expensive laser diodes and photonics in the same way old computers were a circuitboard of expensive transistors and electronics. Ultimately these devices are just a big logic chain/path through a breadboard, that's what electronic engineering is ultimately is.",0

Could possibly still happen. There is still a switch emulator or two under active development, and a team almost always comes out of nowhere when a new console comes out.

Not necessarily. That was true of the Gamecube/Wii, but otoh, the GBA/DS/3DS maintained backwards compatibility by carrying the older chipset forward as part of each new console's design. Ie, the 3DS had its own unique hardware, but also had the DS chipset inside for compatibility.

They know and we know that the Switch 2's backwards compatibility will still be inferior to emulation. All they've done is try stamp out the superior option.

technology,1gknjn4,"Nintendo Switch’s successor will be backwards compatible with Switch, Nintendo confirms | Information about the console will be revealed at a later date.","Fair. 

But I think that's pretty unlikely and not much of an option for modern consoles anymore.  You can't have an entire switch 1 plus switch 2 chipset on the same mobile handheld, with both space, size, power and cost constraints. It'd just be too impractical.  Especially when the new one is going to be powered by the successor in the same family of Nvidia chip designs.

I have seen rumours of increased copy protection and perhaps anti emulation tech inside the console itself, but Nintendo has never really been that technical so I'm not necessarily confident them in putting some pioneering DRM advances in.   So keeping the Switch 2 similar to switch has so many advantages for Nintendo (in terms of cost) that I'd be shocked if they did something different.",5

What they *did* do was figure out a way to bring it to the consumer in an economic and very-playable way. The Game Boy was not the first handheld console. It wasn't even the first handheld console with a backlight. Joysticks had analog sticks before Nintendo put one in a console and the DS wasn't the first thing that had a touch screen.

Nintendo machines tend to be less computationally powerful, but with more polish, longer battery life and better games, plus or minus a gimmick or two.

Boeing machinists ended a seven-week strike after approving a new contract, with 59% of the votes in favour. The agreement includes a 38% wage increase over four years, improved retirement benefits, and bonuses.

You really overestimate how attainable generational wealth type assets are.  True generational wealth is beyond all but the highest paid engineers and executives.

I've NEVER heard of Boeing as a place to build that kind of wealth.  Just a place that was stable and good to it's employees.  That was the past, now.  Boeing isn't competing to be the best any more.  They're competing to make money for the shareholders.

The other issue is allocation of the labor which is the number one complaint about Boeing. You might have a hard covering a machinist into a quality inspector with all the union protections.

Because it's dumb to make promises that you can't guarantee you can keep? Pensions from non-government entities are by definition a fallacy, **no company** can know that they will still be around and successful 35 years down the line. 

Pensions also create a dangerous dynamic where the company can effectively hold you hostage over your pension. I've read countless stories from people where they got fired a year away from retiring on full pension, and so on. Aside from that, even if a company is treating you decently you can't chose to move to a different company or you lose your perfect pension dream. 

Same deal with companies mismanaging pensions. Doesn't need to be fraudulent (syphoning money out of the pension fun, or dipping into it during hard times), just making bad investment decisions that (in some cases) no one could have foreseen. With a 401k this can also happen, but it's on you because you can choose how it's invested. 

401k aren't perfect and I imagine companies generally pay less towards them than they would have to do with pensions. But you have full control over that and the ability to move to a different employer if you so chose without ANY downsides. 

Anyway... I think 401k or something equivalent where your retirement is in your hands is an infinitely better option over pensions, even for governments.

A pension takes that responsibility out of the employees hands, there is not opportunity to take the money and spend it.

technology,1gk501e,Boeing machinists end strike after approving labor contract with 38% wage increases,"This reply got way longer than it probably should be, but here goes:

Yes. By _far_. Because that wage is yours the second it is paid, and the company no longer has any bearing on what happens to that money. It can go to your IRA, it can go to your beer money, it can go under your bed for all anyone should care. The core difference here is that it is cold hard cash in your possession that you are not beholden to a company remaining solvent for to access. If your company goes under and you are getting a wage, you can just get another job. If you are getting a pension? Well, tough shit.

And the money paid into retirement as part of a pension isn't free either, you are literally just giving the company a low interest loan because they only have to come up with the money during your retirement instead of right now. The returns in the long run are horrendous compared to even a very conservative 401k with an employer match, which is what everyone outside of the trades and other 'traditional' jobs have.

With a generic non leveraged index mix in a 401k, you only 'lose everything' if the US as a country fails, in which case your pension is already gone as well. The largest risk is in people giving control to predatory fund managers like Edward Jones getting people to make bad investments with their 401ks because they aren't financially literate enough to know otherwise.

And this isn't hypothetical. Sears and Yellow pensioners got utterly screwed during their bankruptcy proceedings. Even the recent SVB failure lost massive amounts of money for local teacher's union retirement funds.",1

technology,1gkzkg0,The EU is looking into Corning for alleged anti-competitive practices / The company is the dominant provider of glass to smartphone manufacturers.,"TLDR 

The European Commission is investigating Corning, the manufacturer of Gorilla Glass, for suspected anti-competitive practices. The EU alleges that Corning requires smartphone manufacturers and glass processors to purchase nearly all their alkali-aluminosilicate glass exclusively from them. Additionally, Corning offers rebates to those who comply with this requirement and prohibits them from considering competitive offers. According to the Commission, these actions reinforce Corning's dominant position in the smartphone glass market.",2

technology,1gkzkg0,The EU is looking into Corning for alleged anti-competitive practices / The company is the dominant provider of glass to smartphone manufacturers.,"The analogy to ASML would not work imo. Corning is doing exclusivity deals and even giving discounts to certain customers. How is a competitor to rise up if their potential customers are already blackmailed by Corning. ASML has competitors left and right. The only advantage of ASML is EUV for cutting edge chips. For other nodes there is Canon, Nikon etc. ASML is not blackmailing anyone to buy their machines.

technology,1gkzkg0,The EU is looking into Corning for alleged anti-competitive practices / The company is the dominant provider of glass to smartphone manufacturers.,"Yeah that could be a way they could use to get the regulators off their backs. In the case of ASML, the EU could split it up in 2 companies so they could start to compete with each other if it finds that they are a monopoly. But just as you said ASML could also ""invest"" in some competitor if it takes the entire market.",2

It's unnoticeable in most cases. The issue is aliasing and just general clarity of virtual screens - Quest 3 is just approaching the ability to do 720p TVs. Apple Vision Pro is at around 1080p level. 

> I just want to be able to completely isolate myself, lay down and watch a movie. Something about that has always sounded amazing.

I still hear from Apple Vision Pro owners that it's amazing even at a perceived 1080p resolution just because of how grand of a spectacle it is compared to a tiny living room TV.

 \---

Both VR (monitor replacement) and AR (smartphone replacement) seem like they are a decade or more away from starting their exponential growth cycle.  On the display resolution side AVP seems closest.  That said, AVP still needs to have

* an affordable price (the current value for money spent is way too low).
* 8 hour comfort
* more software evolution (e.g. infinite virtual screens for your MacBook)

  
I predict there will be no *killer app* until the product is better.  I don't see both the price coming down and the HMD getting comfortable enough to wear for work.  While engineering can help with comfort, a big part of this is making the device lighter which takes technological advances beyond simply replacing aluminum and glass with plastic.

not to mention more subtle things

* fixing accommodation / vergence conflict
* a complete field of view (not critical for screen work but still valuable.  Peripheral vision is a potential input)
* a mature haptic solution",3

technology,1gkxgpp,"Meta is reportedly rethinking its VR strategy, cutting funding for some studios",How do you watch movies with friends in VR?,1
technology,1gkxgpp,"Meta is reportedly rethinking its VR strategy, cutting funding for some studios","The way that generally works is, a company invests in a development studio to make the product for their platform.


The incentive for developers is that they have little to no out of pocket development cost, but the investor takes a sizeable chunk of the profit. So the developer will want it to be successful so they can earn a large return while they had a safe ability to create it, and the investor spends a lot up front with the expectation for a large return on investment.  


So the important thing to understand is that it doesn't really matter if these games are amazing or not, if the return on investment is less than developing on another platform it just doesn't make sense for most dev companies to risk.


Not only would it be a very different approach to game design and development, meaning it's likely going to be a rougher development cycle, but they'll likely make a lot less from all the work they did even if it's really good.


It isn't like there aren't great games on VR already. But none of them are massive hits, it's just not possible. Half Life Alyx is an obvious example. If Valve made a Half Life 3 instead it probably would have netted a fuckton more money, but Valve had a secondary incentive which was to sell their headset (Valve Index), hence why it was also bundled with it for a time.
