Programming,1chs4ib,The State of the Subreddit (May 2024),653,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/,151,"Hello fellow programs! 

**tl;dr** some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam. The most notable are: banning **listicles** (""7 cool things I copy-pasted from somebody else!""), **extreme beginner articles** (""how to use a for loop""), and some **limitations on career posts** (they must be related to programming careers). Lastly, I want **feedback** on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to **vote** and **use the report button** when you see posts that violate the rules because they'll help us get to it faster.

r/programming's mission is to **be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day**. [Last time we spoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/173viwj/meta_the_future_of_rprogramming/) I introduced the rules that we've been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, quality on the subreddit while not perfect is much improved since then. Since it's still mainly just me moderating it's hard to tell what's objectively bad vs what just annoys me personally, and to do that I've been keeping an eye on a few forms of content to see how they perform (using mostly votes and comment quantity & health).

Based on that the notable changes are:

* üö´ **Listicles**. ""7 cool python functions"", ""14 ways to get promoted"". These are usually spammy content farms. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.
* üö´ **Extreme beginner content** (""how to write a for loop""). This is difficult to identify objectively (how can you tell it from good articles like ""how does kafka work?"" or ""getting started with linear algebra for ML""?) so there will be some back and forth on calibrating, but there has been a swath of very low quality [""tutorials""](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chogwb/first_program_of_java/) if you can even call them that, that I very much doubt anybody is actually learning anything from and they sit at 0 points. Since ""what is a variable?"" is probably not useful to anybody already reading r/programming this is a quick painless way to boost the average quality on the subreddit.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Career posts must be related to software engineering careers**. To be honest I'm personally not a fan of career posts on r/programming at all (but shout out to [cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)!) but during the last rules revision they were doing pretty well so I know there is an audience for it that I don't want to get in the way of. Since then there has been growth in this category [all across the quality spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/domain/eng-leadership.com/) (with an accompanying rise in product management methodology like ""agile vs waterfall"", also across the quality spectrum). Going forward these posts must be distinctly related to software engineering careers rather than just generic working. This isn't a huge problem yet but I predict that it will be as the percentage of career content is growing.

In all of these cases the category is more of a tell that the quality is probably low, so exceptions will be made where that's not the case. These are difficult categories to moderate by so I'll **probably make some mistakes** on the boundaries and that's okay, let me know and we'll figure it out.

Some other categories that I'm **keeping an eye on** but not ruling on today are:

* **Corporate blogs** simply describing their product in the guise of ""what is an authorisation framework?"" (I'm [looking at you Auth0](https://www.reddit.com/domain/a0.to/) and [others like it](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cgx739/what_is_ai_infrastructure_software/)). Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that's okay when it's ""writing a good article will make people think of us"" but it doesn't go here if it's just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don't spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.
* **Generic AI content** that [isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chll2o/ai_still_hasnt_figured_out_branding_yet_heres_why/) technical in content. ""Does Devin mean that programming is over?"", ""Will AI put farmers out of work?"", ""Is AI art?"". For a few weeks these were the titles of about 20 articles per day, some scoring high and some low. Fashions like this come and go but I'm keeping an eye on it.
* **Newsletters**: There are a [few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cho9ye/big_tech_digest_15_introducing_meta_llama_3_at/) that post every edition of their newsletter to reddit, where that newsletter is really just aggregating content from elsewhere. It's clear that they are trying to grow a monetised audience using reddit, but that's okay if it's providing valuable curation or if the content is good and people like it. So we'll see.
* **Career posts**. Personally I'd like r/programming to be a deeply technical place but as mentioned there's clearly an audience for career advice. That said, the posts that are scoring the highest in this category are mostly people upvoting to agree with a statement in the title, not something that anybody is learning from. (""Don't make your engineers context-switch."" ""Everybody should get private offices."" ""Micromanaging sucks."") The ones that one could actually learn from with an instructive lean mostly don't do well; people seem to not really be interested in how to have the best 1:1s with their managers or how you went from Junior to Senior in 18 hours (though [sometimes they are](https://www.reddit.com/domain/highgrowthengineer.com/)). That tells me that there's some subtlety to why these posts are scoring well and I'm keeping an eye on the category. What I don't want is for ""vote up if you want free snacks"" to push out the good stuff or to be a farm for the other 90% of content that's really just personal brand builders.

I'm sure you're as annoyed as I am about these but they're fuzzy lines and difficult to come up with objective criteria around. As always **I'm looking for feedback** on these and if I'm missing any and any other points regarding the subreddit and moderation so let me know what you think.

## The rules!

With all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.

‚úÖ means that it's currently allowed, üö´ means that it's not currently allowed, ‚ö†Ô∏è means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.

* ‚úÖ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.
* ‚úÖ Academic CS or programming papers
* ‚úÖ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.
* ‚úÖ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. These must be related or specific to programming/software engineering careers in some way
* ‚úÖ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.
* üö´ Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male.
* üö´ Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.
* ‚úÖ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub
* üö´ Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.
* üö´ AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.
* üö´ Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.
* üö´ Surveys and üö´ Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.
* üö´ Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).
* üö´ Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security ""blogs"" that syndicate stories like this. Pretty much all listicles are disallowed under this rule. 7 cool python functions. 14 ways to get promoted. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme beginner content. What is a variable. What is a `for` loop. Making an HTPT request using curl. Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them, but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.
* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly üö´ Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and üö´ Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.)
However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.",2024-05-01 17:37:38

Programming,1gq605g,Seeking Feedback on Starting an Open Source IoT Automation Project,0,http://www.home-assistant.io,0,"I‚Äôm considering starting an open source project aimed at creating a flexible, easy-to-use IoT automation platform in the JavaScript ecosystem. While there are two popular automation platforms‚ÄîOpenHAB (Java-based) and Home Assistant (Python-based)‚ÄîI believe there‚Äôs a strong opportunity for a similar tool built around JavaScript, given its large community and ecosystem.

The vision is to develop a platform similar to Home Assistant, but focused on automating a wide variety of environments, such as farms, homes, greenhouses, and gardens. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the project scope and goals:

Technology Stack: The backend will be built with Node.js, while the frontend will be developed in React. This will allow us to leverage the strengths of JavaScript across the stack and cater to JavaScript developers.
Device Integration: The platform will provide examples and SDKs for connecting end devices, especially popular and affordable microcontrollers like ESP8266 and ESP32. These devices can act as sensors, switches, and controllers, expanding the project‚Äôs use cases across various applications.
Customizability and Ease of Use: A key goal is to make the software highly customizable and intuitive, so users can easily set up and automate tasks with minimal configuration.
Hardware Affordability: The software should be lightweight enough to run on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi, allowing more users to deploy it without major expenses.
I‚Äôm looking for feedback and suggestions on a few areas:

Architecture: Are there specific patterns or frameworks that would help make this project scalable and maintainable? What are the best practices for handling device communication (e.g., MQTT, WebSockets)?
Funding: What are some potential funding sources or strategies for sustaining an open source project like this? I‚Äôm considering options like Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, or crowdfunding.
Community Input: Is there an interest in a JavaScript-based automation platform for general-purpose automation across different environments? Any feature ideas or specific use cases that would make this more impactful?",2024-11-13 05:41:23

Programming,1gnew38,Modern Java Book,195,https://javabook.mccue.dev,44,"This is a book intended to teach someone the Java language, from scratch. 

You will find that the content makes heavy use of recently released and, for the moment,
preview features. This is intentional as much of the topic ordering doesn't work
without at least Java 21.

Right now I have several key areas where I could use some help:

* Writing Challenges. Most of the early sections have challenges students can do to test
their understanding of the topics covered and for practice. I've shifted my focus away from
these to make more progress on the main content of the book. Any assistance would be appreciated.
* Theming. A lot of the chapters are...bland. Purely technical. I find that when I have the imagination to ""theme"" the subjects they become higher quality and more engaging overall. See
an anime you liked recently and think you can make the math chapters use the characters from it?
Give it a shot!
* Fixing Mechanical Issues. I don't have an editor and I don't often proofread. If you find mechanical errors
in my grammar or find issues with the way topics are ordered I would welcome fixes.

Notably I do not want to open the floodgates for contributions on the main chapter content
just yet. This has the downside of slower progress but the upside of a more coherent result.

My primary goals with this are

* Get the ordering of topics right. By this I mean that every topic covered should have had its prerequisites covered in the topics previous. While ""lesson 1: Inheritance"" is clearly wrong
in this regard, some things are more subtle.
* Be a template for other people. This is a book. Not everyone likes books, some like youtube videos, some like over priced udemy courses, some attend College, etc. Everyone has different learning paths. I hope this to be of use to anyone looking to make a more up to date Java
curriculum and hope that the vague order of things (which I consider superior to the content
produced with the Java of years' past) is carried through.
* Write as if the newest Java wasn't new. It's obvious when a book was written before Java 8
because it always has newer additions with ""addendum: brand new stuff in Java 8."" But 
the order language features were introduced is hardly a good order to teach them. You have
to pretend that Java 23+  has always been *the* Java. Does it really make sense to show terrible
C-style switch statements way before switch expressions?
* Write as if the words Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, etc. didn't exist.
While I understand that these all have definitions and are useful concepts to know about, introducing them early seems to lead to either dogma, rejection of said dogma, or some
mix thereof. None of them are actually needed to understand the mechanics of and motivation
behind what we would call ""object oriented"" or ""functional"" techniques. They certainly don't
work as justification for adding getters and setters to every class.

My immediate short term goal is to get this ""ready to go"" for when anonymous main classes is in a stable Java release. Thats the point at which we could start to:

1. Have actual students go through it without also needing to explain the `--enable-preview` mechanism.
2. Use the topic order to build other sorts of non-book resources like videos, curriculums, projects, etc.
3. Convince actual teachers to change from ""objects first"" to something less insane.

I haven't integrated `println` or `readln` yet, but will do so eventually.",2024-11-09 17:16:13

I checked docs and with copilot chat itself and there is no way to have a configuration file, local or global, to instruct copilot to not read files, like a .gitignore

So, in the case that you retain untracked files like a .env that populates environment variables, when opening it, copilot will send this file to the cloud exposing your development credentials.

The same issue can arise if you accidentally open ‚Äúad-hoc‚Äù a file to edit it with vsc, like say your ssh config‚Ä¶

Copilot offers exclusions via a configuration on the repository on github https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/setting-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization/excluding-content-from-github-copilot

That‚Äôs quite unwieldy and practically useless when it comes to opening ad-hoc, out of project files for editing.

Please don‚Äôt make this a debate about storing secrets on a project, it‚Äôs a beaten down topic and out of scope of this post.

The real question is how could such an omission exist and such a huge security vulnerability introduced by Microsoft?

I would expect some sort of ‚Äúexplicit opt-in‚Äù process for copilot to be allowed to roam on a file, folder or project‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt you?

PR Review Tool - making code reviews way easier üíª‚ú®

Yo dev fam! Just built a CLI tool that does all the boring review stuff and writes up PR descriptions automatically. It uses AI to check out your Git diffs, breaks things down, and gives you a solid review or description. Basically, it‚Äôs saving me from endless code reviews and awkward explanations in team meetings 

It‚Äôs anything new, but is actually helping me in daily basis.

What it does:
- Auto Code Reviews ‚Äì Gives you a quick rundown on issues, best practices, and improvements
- Easy PR Descriptions ‚Äì No more struggling to explain changes; it even makes diagrams üôå
- Three Modes ‚Äì Full review, short summary, or just a quick ‚Äúthis is what‚Äôs up‚Äù option
- Clean Diff View ‚Äì Organizes changes by file so you don‚Äôt get lost in the details
- Logs Everything ‚Äì So if something goes wrong, you know exactly where to look

To run it, it‚Äôs as simple as:
- pr-reviewer -b feature/your-branch for a basic review
- Or pr-reviewer -b feature/your-branch -m description -t main if you want a detailed PR write-up

Bonus: you can totally customize this as much as you want. The only thing you need is an OpenAI API key, and you're good to go.

Check it out here: pr-reviewer on npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/pr-reviewer

Would love any feedback! Let me know what you think, and feel free to suggest features or changes üôèn",2024-11-03 17:09:03

Programming,1gg4yc1,Just learned why Rust doesn't allow multiple mutable references. Not what I thought.,0,https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/,17,"I'll start off by saying that I am professionally a web developer and never really learned systems level languages in school. So I've been on a journey to learn systems level development and some embedded development too. It's been a bit difficult as I made assumptions when learning higher level languages about how things worked under the hood. Had to unlearn all of my assumptions.

But I taught myself the basics of C and made a very basic http server, only single threaded, not very impressive. Then I started learning Rust. Learning C first really helped but I still had tones of gaps. I finally got to the bottom of almost all of the memory safety issues in C and how rust prevents them, but there was one I didn't understand. Why can you not have multiple mutable references, even in a single thread. 

At first I assumed it had to do with some sort of concurrency issue, and maybe it technically wasn't unsafe in a single threaded context, rust just did have a good solution for this case. And since Rusts rules are exhaustive it just blocked it for that reason.

But in the end it comes down to a concept in C called restrict pointers. I won't pretend to fully understand restrict pointers, but basically a restricted pointer tells the compiler that no other pointer will be used to reference the underlying data. So I learned in Rust all references are the equivalent of restricted pointers in C. Now I understand the rule, but I still don't understand why.

So restricted pointers are used to actually optimize the output assembly from the compiler. It's just for optimization, but rust enforces this optimization. It's totally fair anyways, I have never been in a situation when I needed multiple mutable references anyways haha!

There are a few other reasons that we can't have multiple mutable. For example the Rust enum type can hold values, and that causes some particular issues for references. As well as iterator invalidation. However both of these seem to be able to be solved if reference were not treated as restricted. But I could be wrong. Would love to hear other opinions on this!

Not sure if other people had the same question that I did, but it took me months for me to even stumble on restricted pointers in C after reading portions of the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) which I understood maybe 20% of lol. Hope this helps someone else on their journey!",2024-10-31 03:04:10

I recently came across an AI Reddit bot on Product Hunt that can search Reddit and use AI to reply to certain posts. I thought it was a really cool concept, so I decided to try building my own version‚Äîeven though I had no prior experience with Python, machine learning, or AI.

After some trial and error, I managed to create and publish a CLI tool that lets anyone easily build a bot directly from the command line. The bot can search for specific keywords and automatically leave comments on posts that match those keywords.

It‚Äôs still an early version and definitely needs more work, but I‚Äôm excited about the progress so far. I‚Äôd love to get some feedback from this community, so let me know what you think. 

Thanks!",2024-10-24 11:05:28
Programming,1gb0epd,Bunch of advices for junior and mid devs,0,https://example.com,9,"I‚Äôve just realized I wasted time on commenting on some YouTube random video. However it turns out my thoughts are the ones I‚Äôd like to hear 10 years ago so I decided to share it here as well. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find it helpful some day. Criticism is welcome too!

13 years of commercial exp here. Some advices from me:
1. Stop leetcoding, stop doing tutorials, stop chatGPTing. Instead: read docs, write free software that people wants and be patient - it needs a lot of time! Build projects that seem to be ""a bit too hard"".
2. Companies tend to promote you too fast on higher levels to make sure you'll stay with them for a longer time and you'll fail interviews for senior roles knowing that you're not a senior. Keep it in mind.
3. Learn how computers work. No matter what language you pick.
4. Learn both client and server side software engineering. 
5. Learn how to deploy your apps on VPS/Dedicated server. Optimize and automate it too.
6. Whenever you face a difficult error: stop asking chatGPT, copy-pasting stackoverflow answer. Think! Understand what's the problem, why it occurs, how can it be solved. These moment are the ones that make you better SWE
7. Whenever something is really slow or costs too much: learn how to optimize, research for better architecture, analyze you infrastructure.
8. Play with new promising but unstable technologies. You'll learn a lot when facing difficulties on configuring it. Just do the same as in point 6.
9. If you're brave enough: Change jobs and projects often. Especially when they become boring or too easy.
10. The easiest way to win any tech discussion is by showing numbers.
11. Every code has one purpose: trash - just a matter of time. The other story is with data. Know the priorities.
12. Learn to say ""no"". If someone complains: see point 10.
13. Be responsive for your work.
14. Security is important. Always.

(Below are things I didn‚Äôt agree with this video, but I find this helpful enough to include here too) 
1. Taking the scrum master role: unless you want to stay in the company forever it's waste of time. It builds up your ego, and that's pretty much it. It might sound cool when you're a team leader, however it should be a side effect only. Otherwise, you'll end up having many useless meetings, and no time for SWE.
2. Quick replies to urgent requests: it depends. Priorities first. Hard to swallow pillow: it's more important who you help, than what you do when it comes to resolve urgent tickets. Don't be a guy who works 24/7. No one will remember you (maybe only your kids when you're at the office all the time). Do things that MATTER.

And last advice:
if you have DEMO session in your company, it's - literally - the best way to promote yourself. Don't just show work you've done. Explain why it's important, what's the impact of your change, compare old and new (yours). Just be a f*** Steve Jobs on every DEMO session. This is the EASIEST way how to get promoted. Don't impress your boss - impress their boss.

enjoy and code,
cheers",2024-10-24 11:33:13

Programming,1g9qa77,[Open Source] SwarmGo: Build Scalable AI Agents with Go (MIT License),0,https://github.com/prathyushnallamothu/swarmgo,0,"
I‚Äôm excited to announce that I‚Äôve just open-sourced SwarmGo, a Go framework that makes it easy to build, coordinate, and manage multiple AI agents. Inspired by OpenAI‚Äôs Swarm framework, SwarmGo is designed to help developers quickly implement AI-driven workflows with customizable functions and agent handoffs.

Key Features:

	‚Ä¢	Agent Handoffs: Agents can pass control based on context, making it perfect for scenarios where multiple capabilities need coordination.
	‚Ä¢	Custom Functions: Define specific functions or tools that agents can use to perform tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight and Scalable: Designed to handle independent agent interactions without complexity or bloat.
	‚Ä¢	MIT Licensed: Free to use, modify, and contribute to!

If you‚Äôre working with Go and AI or exploring AI-driven workflows, I‚Äôd love for you to check it out and let me know what you think! üéâ

üëâ https://github.com/prathyushnallamothu/swarmgo

I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions, get feedback, or hear ideas for future improvements. I built this package to contribute back to the Go and AI communities, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it can be used in real-world applications.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!
