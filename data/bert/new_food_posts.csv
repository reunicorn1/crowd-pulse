You basically make a standard cheesecake recipe but for the sweet potato, I roasted them, let them cool, then added cinnamon and nutmeg and just folded it into the cream cheese filling. 

The pecans were also roasted, then I melted down a little sugar and water to toss them in. Once they were cooled, I sprinkled a tiny bit of salt on them. 

The caramel was from a jar though.... Who has time to make caramel and a cheesecake? Come on now üòÇ

food,1gq60rw,[Text] The worst hot sauce experience I've ever had.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1gq60rw/text_the_worst_hot_sauce_experience_ive_ever_had/,2,"I wrote this for a stupid YouTube comment from Tom Scott on his Hot Ones mockup video - figured I would share it here, since it got... a little bit overboard. Go watch it, the video is (somewhat funny) but still great.

  
Around 11pm, I was hungry and in town, so I went to a Mexican taco place in the middle of `average small shitty canadian ""city""`. I'm no newbie to spicy food, so I decided that the ""hot"" salsa might be a good idea, assuming that it would be by Canadian spice standards as usual. I then drive down to a community strip of grass thing, like a park, with no lights holding my fish soft taco. Immediately, I take a massive bite, then a few more. It was completely fine - good, even, for the first minute or so. I get about half the taco down. Mind you, the sauce was spread pretty well around the entire taco, so I assumed it was to be the pleasant sting I was expecting. I pause for a second for a breath between mouthfuls, and notice the pain begin to grow. I take a sip of the Jarritos (a Mexican pop) sitting next to me, lime as always, and notice it starts to sting... more? Of course the carbonation wouldn't help. Conveniently, there's a 3 liter jug of water in my trunk, mostly full. I keep it on hand for hydration, to wash things off, and after that one incident where the coolant in my engine decided to blow a fitting and vaporize.  
  
One gulp of said water later, the situation didn't seem to improve. I could feel it stinging, more analogue to horseradish with its vinegary assault than a slow, burning pepper sauce - getting to the upper limits of my tolerance. Then the ""face melting"" begins. A blush, pulsing through the veins in my face, began to form - surely more water will help with that? I stand up. Worry begins to form - it isn't starting, it isn't slowing down. Soon, I begin to feel in actual pain. Worse than a kick in the shin or the balls, probably a worse pain than I had felt in a while. I've been consistently taking gulps of water, and am now starting to feel the water sloshing around. I'll have to spit the water out - naturally, though I attempted not to, it ends up soaking my shirt and pants throughout.  
  
At this point, I'm beginning to get vocal. If you've ever heard the sounds a pufferfish makes out of water, think of that, then amplify it about fifteen times and pitch down a few octaves. My face must be fully red at this point, and the sauce begins to level off - but I'm in the most pain I can remember. I continue to shriek like a dying wild high lung capacity animal for what felt like a very long time. During this, a random guy, maybe 20, 25 years old walks up. I have to communicate to them that I am in fact not on hallucinogenics or similar drugs, and have indeed just eaten a VERY hot taco, which takes a long time in between pitched-down hyena wails and cups of water splashing everywhere on the pavement.  
  
After some time, it begins to calm down, and the shaking. Oh my god, the shaking starts - I'm practically vibrating, partially in relief, partially in anxiety for if it comes back, even though I know it won't. It doesn't settle until I'm long out of there, trying to find a towel. Never again... I wonder if the Indian immigrant working the counter wanted to ""teach me a lesson"", me being a white male.  


oh, by the way, I didn't waste the other two tacos, I managed to take the fish and rice out and eat it - the sauce was mostly on the lettuce above. The tacos were quite good sans concentrated hydrochloric acid. And yes, I still like spicy food. My tolerance is around homegrown habanero and cayenne level - tabasco is easy. I'm sorry you had to read this.",2024-11-13 05:42:26

I am looking for recommendations for apps that can eliminate our current ""punch card"" system. We have a Square POS but we are not allowed to take card payments. All transactions must be cash. This eliminates all the software options from Square (to my understanding). Since my square is running on an ipad I would like to be able to just have a different app that I could access on the same ipad to track these purchases.   
I need the app to keep track of a balance for each person separately. Tracking how much was paid and on what date, dates and amounts of purchases, and have the ability to calculate a running balance.   
Bonus points if it can email a weekly transaction report. Ease of use is a must!!",2024-11-12 21:58:44

Today on ""Will it Blackstone?"" Pork Lo Mein & Chicken Fried Rice (for my üêï) 

The pork was marinated overnight in gochujang, tamari, mirin, pear, ginger, garlic, shallot, and red chilis.

Lo Mein Sauce
1/4c tamari (can sub soy sauce)
1/4c brown sugar
1/2tbsp cornstarch
1tsp olive oil
2tsp mirin (can sub white wine or sake)

Start with soaking the noodz while you prep so they're soft and noodly when it's time for them.

Spread some butter around on medium heat and toss on your mix of veggies. I used broccoli, carrots, snow peas, sprouts, pepper, garlic, scallions, and shallots.

On the other side drop some plain chicken for your dogs ü§£

Cook the veg mix until everything starts to soften, you might have to add a little butter or oil if they start sticking. Then drop noodz üòÖ I like to squirt a little broth on them but water will also work. 

Once noodz are done, mix in the veggies and lo mein sauce then set it all aside. Add more sauce and toss as needed. 

Brown the marinated pork and mix it all together, use an old takeout container for fauxthenticity üòÇ top w/ fried wonton strips, scallions, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and enjoy!

For the dogs, it was rice with tumeric, carrot, sweet potato, and celery mixed with chicken üòÜ",2024-11-10 19:23:22

So this time i got it right, i got white bread, toasted it longer in my small oven, mixed butter, salt and pepper in the beans on the hob and buttered the toast.  It tastes SO good!  It tasted so much better than the first time. The beans tasted better, the bread was crunchy, it was so good. I ate it in less than a minute it tasted so good

I added cheese on the second one it was ok i didnt taste the cheese much, its still good

I love salads, loaded nachos, some soups, stir frys and loaded pastas, and flavor wise I like really spicy or sour like Chile lime or lemon pepper or creole. If there isn't anything crunchy in it like a soup or pasta or, I add chips or crackers. Anyone have any recommendations for foods like these? I like most vegetables and meats as well. I can cook most things but I don't really bake or bread things. ",2024-11-10 02:45:44

I made this stock in under 3 hours. Roasted 4-5 pounds of turkey necks, a frozen chicken carcass, leeks, carrots, and celery and tossed that in the pot with bay leaves, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, and a head of garlic.  

The picked-over meat has plenty of flavor, and the carrots are incredible. The stock is going to sit in the fridge for a couple of days before I freeze it in Souper Cubes silicone molds (1-cup and 2-cup) and then vacuum-seal for storage.

6 egg yoke.
250g grated Parmesan (yes should pecorino)
Grinded fresh black pepper (to taste, I like a lot)
500g guanciale 

Pasta I find tagliatelle works best the sauce sticks better.

Seperate the egg yokes from the whites into a bowl (discard the whites) mix in the grated Parmesan (pecorino of you prefer to be more original, I actually prefer Parmesan with this recipe) grind in some fresh pepper and mix well.

Put a grill pan to high heat and cook your Guanciqle until crispy (you can do this will the pasta cooks).

Now strain the pasta and whilst it it still hot and a bit wet put it in your bowl with egg yoke, pepper and cheese and mix well! (You can add some of the fat from the Guanciqle pan at this point and stir again.

Place the pasta in bowls and then share out the Guanciale evenly on top!

Start with the usual bacon and onions üòÇ I also threw on some frozen fries. The lingui√ßa dogs and veggie burgers were for other people but if it fits it cooks ü§£

Set the bacon aside when cooked and brown both sides of the marinated pork in the bacon fat, it cooks pretty quick because it's thin. Top with cheese, I used cooper sharp american, assemble, and enjoy!

I'm not the best cook but for the past 2 years have been really trying to get better at it that's why I'm asking so far in advance so I have time to make it a few times and hopefully improve so it's actually good in a month and a half.


So if youre not a vegetarian but have some vegetarian dishes you like I'd love some suggestions

food,1gkmel1,[homemade] Spicy Sesame Noodles with Ginger Chicken,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkmel1,0,"Another great recipe from Half Baked Harvest. Dish is Spicy Sesame Noodles with Ginger Chicken and the ingredients directions are:

Ingredients

- 1/3 cup, plus 2 tablespoons peanut or sesame oil

- 1-2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes

- 1/3 cup raw peanuts, roughly chopped

- 2-3 strips orange or clementine peel

- 8 ounces Chinese egg noodles or ramen noodles

- 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce

- 3 tablespoons pomegranate juice (optional)

- 2 tablespoons honey

- 2 tablespoons raw sesame seeds

- 3/4 pound ground chicken

- 3 cups shiitake or cremini mushrooms, sliced

- 1 inch fresh ginger, grated

- 3 cloves garlic, minced or grated

- 2 cups roughly chopped kale or green cabbage

- green onions and pomegranate, for serving

Instructions

1. To make the chili oil. In a large skillet, heat 1/3 cup peanut or sesame oil, and the peanuts over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until the peanuts turn golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and very carefully transfer the oil to a heatproof bowl or glass jar. Stir in the red pepper flakes and orange peel.

2. Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, pomegranate juice (if using), honey, and 1/3 cup water.

3. Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.

4. Place the skillet used to make the chili oil, over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons peanut or sesame oil and the chicken. Season with black pepper and brown all over, breaking the chicken up as it cooks, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, ginger, and garlic, and cook another 2-3 minutes. Slowly pour in 1/2 of the soy sauce mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the sauce coats the chicken and the meat begins to caramelize and get crispy, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining soy sauce mixture, the greens, and sesame seeds. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

5. Stir in the noodles and 2 tablespoons chili oil. Remove from the heat. Serve the noodles warm, topped with additional chili oil and green onions. Enjoy!",2024-11-06 00:55:53
