solotravel,1exwxsa,"Seasonal Holiday Travel Megathread, 2024 Edition",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1exwxsa/seasonal_holiday_travel_megathread_2024_edition/,93,"Hi everyone -

Around this time of year, we start getting a lot of submissions asking about travelling during the winter holidays. Good locations to travel to, what the experience is like, etc.

So this megathread will serve as a hub for the subreddit to discuss seasonal holiday travel plans. Feel free to share stories of past holiday travels, questions about your travel plans for this year, etc.

Some examples of topics you can post about in this thread include:

* Where should I travel to over Christmas / New Year's / the holiday season?
* What is X place like over the holiday season?
* What to do for the holidays while you're travelling?
* Suggestions of Christmas markets or other holiday-themed destinations?
* Stories of past holiday travels

While the most common questions relate to the December/January holiday season, this thread can be used to ask questions about any holiday or seasonal travel.

For inspiration, here's a link to [last year's holiday discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/16x7w9j/holiday_solo_travel_megathread_2023_edition/).",2024-08-21 18:21:13
solotravel,1gq67wy,Trip report: A week in London!,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gq67wy/trip_report_a_week_in_london/,6,"I posted here a couple months ago asking for advice on my first trip to London. [Here is a link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f24jsf/please_critique_my_tentative_solo_london_itinerary/)to the post for anyone interested.

My trip was amazing, and I definitely utilized the advice I got here! I went into a lot of detail about my travel style and preferences in the previous post, but just to summarize: Female early 30s, like to wander and explore neighborhoods, don't really like churches or nightlife, vegetarian. I like to mix up my meals with market food, some nicer or unique restaurants, and local chains. I also LOVE checking out local grocery stores, and this trip did not disappoint!

* Day Zero (Saturday)
   * I landed at Heathrow around 1 pm. Set up my esim and navigated to the Elizabeth Line pretty easily. Citymapper was an absolute must for this trip - I used it everyday for all kinds of public transit.
   * Transferred to a bus at Paddington to get to my hotel (normally is accessible by the underground but there was planned maintenance that closed the station closest to my hotel for the first couple days I was there). I ended up at Paddington a lot this trip and it was not my favorite lol, just very big and busy.
   * Checked in at the [London House Hotel](https://www.londonhousehotels.com/). Overall this hotel was fine and fit my needs - good location, clean, not expensive. The only real downside was that the walls were very thin. I could hear everything happening in the hallway outside my room. This didn't end up being a big issue other than one night where I was woken up by some loud people in the hallway.
   * After getting situated at the hotel I went out to explore! Notting Hill is so cute, I loved the whole vibe. I went to the Portobello Road Market, but pretty quickly moved to quieter side streets as it was too overwhelming in my sleep-deprived state (spoiler I ended up going back later.)
   * Had an early dinner at [Rosa's Thai](https://rosasthai.com/), which was lovely. At this point I was ready to crash so I went back to the hotel for the night.
* Day One (Sunday)
   * I got up nice and early to get in a full day of sightseeing! I started with a coffee and pastry from [Blank Street](https://www.blankstreet.com/), both of which were great.
   * I took my coffee to go and had a long meandering walk through Hyde Park. Absolutely loved this, it was so beautiful and peaceful in the morning - that is, until I started noticing more and more groups of runners starting to congregate. Turns out this was the day of the Royal Parks half marathon! I think this particular area of Hyde Park was the start of the race. The running route was all through Westminster, so I kept coming across it as I made my way around. This was slightly annoying as certain crosswalks were blocked off, but because it was so early the race hadn't actually started yet. This meant no cars and no runners, so I was able to stand in the middle of the road and get some nice pictures. Eventually the race did start, and it was actually really fun to watch for a bit and see everyone cheering for the runners.
   * I went from Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace, then walked down the mall to Trafalgar Square. From there I went down Parliament Street hoping to spot Larry the cat at 10 Downing (no luck). Took some pictures and admired Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.
   * I crossed Westminster Bridge and took my time walking along the south side of the Thames. I timed this so that I ended up at Borough Market right after it opened - no lines! I spent a long time looking at everything before getting the mushroom risotto, which was so good! At this point it was getting busier so I found a curb on the edge of the market to sit and eat.
   * After eating and just chilling for a bit I went to the London Bridge City pier to catch an uber boat to Greenwich! I bought my one-way ticket using the ThamesClippers app, but I think you could just do contactless tap like the underground(?). The boat was nice, it felt good to sit lol. The ride to Greenwich was not long, maybe 20 or 25 minutes? That could be wrong but it was definitely not long.
   * I walked up the hill through Greenwich Park and checked out the Royal Observatory, which was very cool (if you're into that kind of thing). I spent a decent amount of time looking at everything, and then spent like an hour and a half sitting in the cafe because I needed a break. 
   * I then wandered around Greenwich with no real aim. It's such a lovely place! I ended up at the Greenwich Market, and checked out some of the chain shops - Waterstones, Boots, etc. I know this probably seems funny to those in the UK but I just find it so interesting to see how they differ from my usual stores!
   * This was also my first Marks & Spencer experience and you guys, I get the hype. I wanted to buy so much of the food. I decided to try some classics so I got a bag of Percy Pigs and some mini Colin the Caterpillars. Don't hate me - I didn't love the Percy Pigs. They were fine, but I've never been into gummy candy. I do love chocolate, so Colin was my favorite of the two.
   * Finally, I went to have Sunday roast at [Richard the First](https://www.richardthefirst.co.uk/)! I chose this pub specifically because it had good reviews of its vegetarian Sunday roast. Everyone was friendly and I was served quickly. The food was great and I'm happy I got to try something (somewhat) traditional!
   * I took the DLR back into Central and then switched to the underground. I knew nothing about the DLR but it came up on Citymapper as the quickest option back so I went with it. I love when cities have lots of transit options!
* Day Two (Monday)
   * This was the only day I had to deal with some bad weather, which I know was pretty lucky. It did cause me to rearrange some plans but it wasn't a big deal.
   * I had an amazing breakfast at [Tab x Tab](https://tabxtab.com/). I got the grilled halloumi, poached eggs and avocado on toast, which I highly recommend. I took my time here and had a couple lattes as it was raining and I wasn't in a hurry.
   * I used the rain as an excuse to check out Waitrose and Tesco. My biggest takeaway: the meal deals!!! I knew about them already but it was different to see in person. So many options! I also love how there's so many ""meal for two"" dinner specials. Also, Heinz has a much more expansive set of products than I ever knew about. Who knew Heinz made pasta sauces? Not me.
   * It was still raining so I decided to postpone my original plan of walking along the mini Venice canals and instead went to [Daunt Books](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/) in Marylebone. This is a must for book lovers, I really enjoyed it!
   * The weather had calmed down a bit so I took the tube up to Hampstead to explore. I can totally understand why people recommended Hampstead, it was picturesque! I wish the weather had been better so I could spend more time wandering around. I did have a lovely afternoon pastry and coffee at [Heath Street Bakehouse](https://www.heathstreetbakehouse.com/).
   * I then walked over to the heath, and made my way up Parliament Hill to check out the view. It was all so beautiful and again, I would've spent more time here with better weather.
   * I took the bus into Kentish Town to get a late lunch at [Queen of Sheba](https://www.thequeenofsheba.co.uk/). This was a recommendation I got from my previous post and it was great! Ethiopian food was new to me and I really enjoyed it.
   * From here I went back to the hotel to chill for a couple hours, then get ready for my evening plan, which was seeing Book of Mormon! This was one of the best experiences of the trip, it was such a great performance. It was at Prince of Wales Theater, which was small enough that even my seat in one of the last rows had a great view.
   * I ended up not having dinner this day as I was still full from the late lunch. However, I didn't know about the West End tradition of ice cream at intermission! I couldn't pass that up.
* Day Three (Tuesday)
   * I originally had this day set as a day trip in my itinerary, but I decided I needed more time in London.
   * I started the day at [Layla Bakery](https://laylabakery.com/) for a coffee and pastry. This place is so cute! Probably my favorite bakery of the trip. They had just reopened with their fall menu and I got a pumpkin and manchego cheese pastry - amazing!
   * I did some more wandering around Notting Hill and admiring the cute houses. I also ordered some empanadas from [De Nadas Empanadas](https://denadas.co.uk/) to go so I could take them to my next destination, Richmond!
   * The tube out to Richmond was a little more complicated, I had to get off and cross the street to a different station(?), but still on the District line. Again, Citymapper made this easy and I had no problems.
   * I'm a Ted Lasso fan so I was excited to see Richmond. I went out to the Richmond Green and ate my empanadas on one of the park benches. 
   * Someone on the Ted Lasso sub put together a self-guided walking tour that hit a bunch of the filming spots, so I used that as a guide. It was a beautiful walk around such a cute little place! I also hung out at the riverside for a while which was nice, but I did have to deal with a drunk guy who wouldn't leave me alone. This is pretty par for the course as a solo female traveller but still annoying. 
   * I dipped as soon as I could and went to [Kiss the Hippo](https://kissthehippo.com/) for an afternoon coffee. From there I went to the Ted Lasso souvenir shop, and finished up with a gelato at [Gelateria Danieli](https://www.gelateriadanieli.com/). 
   * I made my way back to the hotel and accidentally took a nap, lol. It was time for dinner by then so I pulled myself together and went to [Govinda's ](https://govindas.london/?gad_source=1)in Soho. I was looking forward to this as the reviews online were great. The food lived up to the hype, delicious and cheap. However the restaurant itself was packed and very warm, so overall pretty uncomfortable. I ate quickly so I could escape the heat. I ended the night just walking around Soho. Even on a Tuesday night the streets were crowded and I found it pretty overwhelming. I went back to the hotel and ate some Colin the Caterpillars for dessert.
* Day Four (Wednesday)
   * Started the day with a coffee and pastry at [Gail's](https://gails.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorS5m0kOpHcRlS0IxuZDPAQsafyFd8tGk7C5xpWzHGdQyB8niDe). I then took the tube out to Tower Hill. I was a bit early for my Tower of London reservation so I walked along the river a bit and just admired the view.
   * I did the free Yeoman Warder tour to start, which was great! Definitely recommend. I then explored everything else on my own, which I think took a couple hours. I found all the history interesting, but I imagine someone more into it than me would take more time.
   * It was roughly noon when I left the Tower of London, so I walked to [Roti King](https://rotiking.com/food-drink/) for lunch. Wow, this place was amazing! So simple, just roti and dahl, and so so good. Also, where has milo been all my life?! 
   * I walked around Spitalfields Market for a while, just checking everything out. I then went to the [Brick Lane Vintage Market](https://www.vintage-market.co.uk/), which I really enjoyed! I bought a sweater and some candles.
   * I then walked over to [Horizon 22](https://horizon22.co.uk/). I booked my ticket ahead of time but I'm not sure how necessary that was. The view was beautiful and I enjoyed it. It was a bit crowded but the space was big enough that it didn't really matter.
   * I was tired of walking at this point so just went back down to the river and sat for a while, just people watching. I also got an ice cream from a cart outside the Tower of London but I can't remember what it was called!
   * I then made my way over to [Tayyabs](https://www.tayyabs.co.uk/) for dinner. So so so good, highly recommend! I wished I was with more people so we could order more and share everything.
   * Back to the hotel for the night, finished off the Colin the Caterpillars.
* Day Five (Thursday)
   * This was my day trip! I booked a tour of some of the Cotswolds and Oxford through [London Walks](https://www.walks.com/). Most of their walks are for a few hours around various areas of London, but they have some longer trips that go outside the city as well. This was a nice break for me from planning and navigating. I had a great time, even though most of the others on the tour were in couples or groups. 
   * We went to Minster Lovell and Burford in the morning and Oxford in the afternoon. I'd love to go back and see more of the Cotswolds. I'm really glad I took a day to see more of England outside of London.
   * On the train home I placed an order at the [Pizza Pilgrims](https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/) near my hotel. Picked it up on my way back and had a hotel room feast (something I consider a must on vacation).
* Day Six (Friday)
   * This was my last day, and I didn't have any real plans. I went to [Arome Bakery](https://www.instagram.com/aromebakerylondon/?hl=en) for breakfast and got probably the prettiest pastry I've ever had (chocolate and pistachio escargot). I think it has to be a tie between Arome and Layla for best bakery of the trip.
   * I then walked through Regent's Park and walked for a bit along the canals like I had planned to earlier. It was a very misty and quiet morning which made for a lovely walk. 
   * I then went to check out Camden Market. I can understand why people think its too touristy and commercialized, but I still enjoyed walking around. Also got the craziest masala fries from [Funky Chips](https://funky-chips.com/)! I didn't know before going but I guess this place has gotten pretty popular on tiktok. I can understand why, the portions were huge and I still ate almost all of it.
   * From here I decided to go back to Hyde Park, since I enjoyed it so much earlier. I also went to Tesco for a candy haul (a truly embarrassing amount of candy). Afterwards I went back to the hotel to get a head start on packing up all my stuff and to chill for a bit.
   * I then went back to truly check out the Portobello Road Market. It was crowded but definitely worth it, I loved looking at everything! I bought a print from a local artist, which is something I try to get everywhere I go.
   * I had a reservation this night to have dinner at [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/). It was delicious and the atmosphere was great (I went to the Kensington location). Again, wished I was with more people so I could've tried more things.
   * From Dishoom I walked to [Oddono's](http://www.oddonos.com/) for some truly great gelato (on par with what I've had in Italy).
* Day Seven (Saturday)
   * I checked out of the hotel and booked a taxi to St. Pancras using the Freenow app, which worked really well. Definitely recommend if you're planning to use taxis in London.

And that was my trip! I know I didn't hit a lot of the usual museums and galleries, but they just weren't my top priority. When I go back (and I will someday!) I'll check some of them out. There was just so much to do and see! Public transit was amazing and made everything so accessible. 

I know this is a massive post, but I hope it helps someone else planning a London trip, just like the other posts I found here did for me!

solotravel,1gq6q3g,Insight/Advice on My 3 Week Itinerary for Vietnam?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gq6q3g/insightadvice_on_my_3_week_itinerary_for_vietnam/,11,"Hi all - I'm (28F) heading out to Vietnam for 3 weeks in January and I'm finally putting together my itinerary. Based on my research, here's how I'm thinking my journey is going to look:

**Day 1:** Arrive in Hanoi (late)

**Day 2, 3, 4:** Hanoi

* Stay: The One Hostel Hanoi

**Day 5, 6, 7, 8:** Ha Giang Loop

* Tour: Mama's Homestay

**Day 9:** Day trip from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay or just head straight to Ninh Binh?

**Day 10, 11:** Ninh Binh

* Stay: The Banana Tree Hostel

**Day 12, 13, 14:** Hue

* Stay: a-maze house OR Shark Homestay? (open to suggestions)

**Day 15, 16:** Hoi An

* Stay: SnapStay Hoi An OR The Cuckoo's Nest Hostel and Bar OR Hoi An LoveLy Hostel OR Wanderlust Hostel OR The Seaside Bungalow Hostel and Bar (clearly can't decide -- open to suggestions!)

**Day 17:** Hoi An (morning), Da Nang (afternoon)

* Stay: Rom Casa Da Nang

**Day 18, 19, 20:** Ho Chi Minh City

* Stay: Saigon Rooftops Hostel

**Day 21:** Depart

Some questions I have:

* Overall, how does my allocations of days look in each place?
* Is it worth doing a day trip to Ha Long Bay (esp in January)? Or should I just head to Ninh Binh
* Is it worth going over to Da Nang to check out that area or should I just spend 3 full days in Hoi An before I head to the airport for HCMC?
* Any insight on the accommodations I've picked out? Only one I have booked is the first one for Hanoi - I'll be overlapping for NYE and wanted a partier vibe. The rest of my trip I definitely want social with the option to party if I want!
* Any other advice, suggestions, insights, can't-miss places/activities welcome! I really love everything from nature to culture and museums to shopping and food. My goal budget is $2500 for the trip but I'm not super pressed if I don't stick to it.

solotravel,1gq5fka,Salento/Cocora Valley solo hike during rainy season,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gq5fka/salentococora_valley_solo_hike_during_rainy_season/,0,"Hello everyone!

Im coming to Colombia next week (mid-late November) and am planning to visit Salento to do the Cocora Valley hike. 

But the forecast looks like it will be raining non-stop. Will I be able to do/enjoy the hike? Will the trail be closed due to mud slides? Will I be able to see the valley views properly or will it be ruined by fog/rain etc.

I will also be doing this hike solo. Is that advisable given the weather conditions? I think Salento will be quiet in November so I’m not sure if I’ll find that many solo tourists to befriend and tag along with.

Any insights will be very helpful! Im not able to find a proper answer online. I was planning to stay in Salento for 2 nights. Should I skip this for another city that would be better worth my time and money?

solotravel,1gq7c9e,Planning my first solo trip to Colombia ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gq7c9e/planning_my_first_solo_trip_to_colombia/,3,"I have a week off in about 2 months and have narrowed it down to Colombia for a solo trip. I know alot of well traveled individuals but oddly enough, nobody has been to colombia so no direct recommendations. I was considering a 5 day trip, flying into medellin and then Cartagena. The coffee region has piqued my interest so now considering a 7 day trip,  into medellin, then Salento area, then Cartagena with about 2 days in each. I'm looking to experience the city with a nightlife and restaurant scene, and area less touristy where I can take in nature and hike, and honestly selected Cartagena just to throw in a beach town. I would love to be able to be in areas where I can meet and strike up conversation with ppl. That said, I don't force those and am comfortable on my own just taking in the ambiance. I'm an amateur photographer interested in historical sights, architecture, events, landscapes, and animal shots. I would look to stay in hotels or abnbs and prefer to fly between towns just in the interest of time. I'm aware of dangers present but I'm an older Hispanic male (35), fluent in Spanish, and grew up in an area where you had to keep your head on a swivel. Also grew up spending alot of time in Mexico so feel like I'll be familiar with the main things I'll need to watch out for. 

Wondering if anyone has visted with a similar itinerary that may have recommendations? Thoughts of how easy it is to get from town to town? Or any city/town that may be more highly recommended as I have not finalized itinerary yet?

solotravel,1gplwx4,Trip report: Scotland and England for 2 weeks in autumn,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gplwx4/trip_report_scotland_and_england_for_2_weeks_in/,3,"Just got back almost a week ago from my 2 week trip to Scotland and England! Thought I share my trip since I [asked for the sub for advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f6zj0h/advice_for_2_weeks_in_the_uk_in_autumn/) and got some helpful comments (and sadly some unhelpful ones). After the sub’s advice, I restructured my trip to be: Edinburgh (3 nights) > Glasgow (3 nights)  > Manchester (2 nights) > London (5 nights).

**A bit about me:** I have solo travelled quite a bit but it was my first time in the UK. I'm a history and museum buff, enjoy nature/hiking, craft beer and craft cocktails.

**Transport:** Used public transport (trains, buses, the Tube) only as I’m not comfortable driving by myself. Despite all the sub’s comments on the UK train system, I only had 1 train cancelled (Manchester to Hope) and I just hopped onto the next one 1 hour later. Also experienced a few delays but none too long. In fact only two delays were long enough that I could apply for delay repay. The bus system actually turned out the most problematic for me!

**Accommodation:** Stayed in hostels mostly (won’t go into details here but feel free to ask), but I booked a room above a pub in Manchester to give myself a breather from hostels and it was nice!

**Highlights of Edinburgh:**

* Arthur’s Seat! I took the easier/long way up, and only at the very top did things get a little rocky/difficult. Quite a nice climb overall and the weather that day was great too so I could really see the whole city from the top. The last part really requires shoes with good grip though. 
* Trying different types of whiskies. I was a big whisky hater before this trip but hey since I’m at the mecca of whiskies, I might as well try some good ones. I went to The Ensign Ewart, and The Bow Bar, as well as Royal Mile Whiskies and all gave me some really good recommendations! Happy to say I’m a whisky convert now and I even bought a bottle home. 
* The Real Mary King’s Close. Very informative historical tour about how people lived in the past, so amazed that some of them are still so incredibly well preserved. 
* Day tour of Glencoe and Loch Ness. After the sub’s advice, I gave up going to Inverness and booked a day tour instead. I loved going to the Scottish Highlands so much! The only downside is that because it’s a day tour from Edinburgh, a lot of time was spent on driving and I only had a short time at each place.
* How walkable Edinburgh is - don’t think I took any public transport other than a bus to get from the airport to my hostel. 

**Things I didn’t enjoy:** 

* Edinburgh Castle. I realised I’m not into the UK’s history before WWI, and the Castle focused a lot on that. The castle was cool, but a little underwhelming.
* Long waiting times for popular restaurants especially on weekends. I didn’t realise it was so crucial to place a reservations for popular restaurants, especially during weekends.

**Highlights of Glasgow:**

* Isle of Arran - only had time for the Glen Rosa hike but omg it was stunning. Think I teared a little bit from the beauty of it all. Love to be back one day to explore the rest of the island. It’s quite a journey as I had to take a \~50 min train and a \~50 min ferry to the island but it was worth it! A note to anyone taking the ferry: they tend to sync the train to Ardrossan Harbour timing with the ferry setting off so there is some time allowance, but the ferry going back to Ardrossan, they stick strictly to all passengers being onboard 10 min before setting off time. Missed my ferry back because I arrived 3 mins after the 10 min mark and had to take the next one 2.5 hrs later T\_T
* Loch Lomond - I only had time for the Conic Hill climb and took the ferry across to Luss. Such a gorgeous place! I also went there during exceptionally good weather so it was even more beautiful. If you are not into the Loch Ness lore, just skip Loch Ness and go to Loch Lomond instead. Just wished the whole loch was more accessible by public transport as I would love to explore other towns/areas of the loch :( This was also where the bus system failed me. I was waiting for the 5.40pm bus back to Glasgow from Luss for 30 mins and it never came. Went to a local cafe for help and they said the bus was cancelled without warning, and the next direct bus was at 3 hrs later. Ended up taking the 7pm local bus to the nearest train station and getting a train back - a really tiring and frustrating process! Was so tired after this long journey back that I missed my alarm the next day and missed my train to Manchester as well.

Immensely thankful to the redditors who recommended these 2 places, they are the highlights of my entire trip :’)

**Things I didn’t enjoy:** 

* The city of Glasgow itself. Doesn’t seem to have much interesting stuff in the city itself to explore compared to Edinburgh. I only had time to go the Kelvingrove art gallery and museum and it was meh to me.

**Highlights of Manchester:**

* Peak District! That was my whole purpose for going to Manchester (not into football at all, sorry football fans). I did the Stanage Edge to Bamford hike for Day 1, and the Mam Tor and Cave Dale hike for Day 2. Enjoyed both hikes very much even though there was foggy weather on both days and didn’t get to see much of the view. After all, hiking is about the process ;) Both hikes were quite beginner-friendly and were well sign-posted and/or only had 1 path most of the time so it was obvious where to go. For the Mam Tor hike, I went the anti-clockwise way (Mam Tor first then Cave Dale) and so thankful I did that because I rather it be steep going up than going down. Both hikes were nearish the train stations as it was a good 20-40 min walk to the nearest train station from the hike starting point. Manageable at the start but becomes tiring after the hike.
* The city of Manchester gives off hipster vibes and I would have loved to have more time to explore the city, but the few hours before and after the peak district - I really enjoyed walking around the city centre 

**Things I didn’t enjoy:** 

* Surprisingly, nothing!

**Highlights of London:**

* Harry Potter WB Studio Tour. As a millennial who basically grew up with the books and then the movies, I loved every single minute of the studio tour and I was there for almost 5 hours! Lots of photo ops, and the queue wasn’t too bad for each photo op. I was also there during their Dark Arts feature so got to see the Death Eaters performance too. A must do for every HP fan! Wished I had dressed up a bit to be on theme. The merch shop was quite disappointing though, I didn’t buy anything as I thought everything was either too ugly and/or overpriced.
* West End musicals - caught Les Mis, The Lion King and Hamilton and as a new musical fan, all 3 shows were so great! Only wished that the Hamilton theatre wasn’t so far out from all the other theatres
* Churchill War Rooms and HMS Belfast. Both museums were incredible and packed with information. I can’t believe how well-preserved both places are. Feels a bit surreal to be in places that were so key to WWII.
* Gin bars! I went to Mr Foggs Gin Palour and City of London Distillery, both excellent gin bars. 
* Hampstead Heath and Kenwood House. Went to Hampstead Heath when I was so sick of London’s crowds and it was a really nice walk. Kenwood House was such a surprising find and it’s interesting to see how lords of the past lived. 

**Things I didn’t enjoy:**

* How crowded London is. Compared to other cities I was in, London was so overwhelmingly crowded, feels like I was dodging people left and right through crowds. I arrived on a Friday so that made things much worse. In the city centre, popular restaurants were at least an hour wait, and I couldn’t even find a seat for 1 at pubs! I come from a very crowded city and I can’t believe London is much worse.
* How expensive London is. Especially with the exchange rate, it was so expensive to take the bus, take the Tube, to eat out. I walked more than half the time, even for 40-50 min. I knew London was expensive but didn’t think it was THAT expensive. Tesco/Sainsbury meal deals were basically my best friend. I don’t mind spending on good food, but I felt that most of the food was mediocre for the amount of money I was paying for it. 

At London, I was experiencing a bit of travel fatigue and I think I didn’t really plan my time properly as now I think back, there were lots of things I wanted to do but forgot somehow. Like how I should have went out on a day trip out of London but I was too tired to plan a day trip then. I also didn't go to a single Guy Fawkes celebration as I couldn't find one in London that had a really large bonfire - I wasn't really interested in seeing fireworks and only wanted to see a huge bonfire.

Clothes: the MVP of the trip is my decathlon waterproof hiking boots (NH150), which held up so well during my hikes! Note that I only went for hikes with bog level 2 as rated on WalkingHighlands, so can’t judge my shoes for boggier walks. I also wore a pair of waterproof pants, and had a fairly water-resistant Kathmandu ultra lightdown jacket. The jacket held up most of the time against the usual misty and light rain, but in Loch Ness, it rained moderately for an hour and I felt that the jacket was beginning to get wet. I also had a proper rain jacket, but (un)fortunately it never rained properly when I wore the rain jacket, so I never got to test how good it was. I also found UK to be a bit warmer than I thought, as I was in NYC last year during the same time period and found it to be colder than the UK. 

Overall, I really loved the Scotland and Manchester parts of my trip, London...not so much. I also LOVED the pub culture in the UK and fell in love with cask ales. I think I had a pint (or 2...) almost every day. I can see myself returning for an Ireland and Scotland trip, and then stopping for 2 days in London before flying off. ",2024-11-12 14:27:04

I come from a very poor upbringing amd limited upbringing so growing up prevented my siblings from experiencing things in life and having a social life similar to people our age. 

This lack of life experience kept up until I graduated college and had first career type of job. 

But being behind life experience snd socialization I haven't traveled as much as one should have and social experience. I've been trying to ""catch up"" over the past decade. 

Now being 40 I hqve way more ability to do things and travel than I ever gave but because people my age are mostly married with kids mist friends focus 99% of their time with their family and it's been hard to get them to wanna do sfuff let alone travel. 

As I get older I'm realizing if I want to do things I'll have to accept doing it alone including travel. 

I'm not afraid of traveling alone and have no problem meeting new people but I don't enjoy traveling alone and ""meeting"" new people and having surface level interactions while traveling. 

I could do tour groups type if traveling but again it's still surface level type of socializing. 

Any idea how to combat these two issues whike traveling?",2024-11-12 02:16:53
solotravel,1gpi90w,Advice: Travelling solo to South America next week ,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gpi90w/advice_travelling_solo_to_south_america_next_week/,25,"Hi everyone, 

I’m a 26 y/o male from England who is going travelling in 6 days, starting with a 1 way flight to Uruguay and my plan is to work down Argentina then back up Chile, then Bolivia and Peru. 

I have no idea how long I’ll be but I have enough money to last me 9 months. 

I’m usually a confident guy but I’m nervous as hell. I’ve only ever solo travelled for a few days at a time. So I guess I’m concerned that I’ll end up lonely and fed up which will make me want to go home. After making such a big fuss and quitting my job for this, it’ll end up not being worth the sacrifices I made. 

Even though it’s just me on this trip, I feel a pressure for it to go well. And if it doesn’t then it’s a waste because I know people would love to have the luxury of being able to do this. 

I also have a (minor) pre existing condition that no insurance providers will cover. So If that flares up then I may have to get on a flight home. 

I’ve been so excited about this for months, now I’m days out I feel a sense of fear about the whole thing. Can anyone relate? ",2024-11-12 11:04:47
solotravel,1gpxxi5,Back home after a solo trip of one year,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gpxxi5/back_home_after_a_solo_trip_of_one_year/,3,"I (38M from Spain) have travelled for almost a year solo in Asia and it has been a wonderfull experience. Met people from all around the world and learned a lot about myself. At some point I felt like it was enough and returned back home. I was able to return again to my old job, but I´m having some difficulties finding an appartment. 

After two months being home, I´m starting to doubt if this is the life I want to live again. Everything has stayed the same during my absence and I feel like there should be more to life than this. This feeling has made me think about my near future. My original travel plan for a year was to do 6 months in (South East) Asia and 6 months in Central America, but I loved Asia so much that I decided to stay there during my whole year. Now I feel like I should do also my solo trip through Central America and even a bit of South America. Since I spend less than I estimated in Asia and I still have enough savings, I can easily do a year of solo travelling again and get back home with still having some savings . 

My mind is now in doubt about what to do. Fill my backpack again and go for a solo trip to Central America starting in January already and this time leave my job definitely and go find my luck in the world OR stay at home and try to make a more pleasant life here. Social pressure of family and friends is also an issue, since they don´t understand why I´m not buying a house and stay put to get a wife and kids. 

It´s a battle of heart and mind right now. I understand that the backpackers lifestyle is not sustainable indefinitely, but I feel like now I have the option and I want to enjoy life the most I can. Life is short and we don´t know when it can suddenly end. I loved the feeling while travelling of waking up in the morning and not knowing what I´m gonna experience that day and what people I´m gonna meet. Also, I would love to meet someone to share my life with and right now I feel I have more chances of meeting new people travelling than back home.  Out there I also felt like a different person: more open, more secure and liking this version of me. That´s everything my heart is telling me. My mind is telling me to try it again in Spain or even move to a new city in Spain which is a bit more international (living in a small city) to build a new life here. Also, to work on myself to make a good life and to apply everything I learned while travelling about myself. 

I want to make a decision for January since that would be that a good month to start a trip from Mexico to South America weather wise. Of course, in the end it´s my decision but I would like to hear some experiences of other people after returning back home from a long solo trip and how their life changed or even stayed the same like before.

solotravel,1gpxhvs,First time solo travelling advice in the UK/Europe,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gpxhvs/first_time_solo_travelling_advice_in_the_ukeurope/,2,"I am Canadian 23M planning to solo travel and live in the UK or Europe next year in mid July 2025 after travelling for a few weeks with family. Which will be mostly Dublin and parts of both Republic and N Ireland, parts of Scotland close to or in Edinburgh, also York and London.

After that I am planning a Contiki trip around Europe for end of July that is about a month long, but after that I don't know what else I want to do apart from visiting heritage railways, the tattoo festival and just roaming cities. I also plan on getting a youth mobility visa that the UK offers. Budget is in the works but about 5-7g Cdn is the range depending on visas and other expenses before trip. I do have family who live in the UK (mostly in towns north of Edinburgh and some in London), but are second or third cousins and don't want to heavily rely on them. (will stay with them for a few days at most but nothing more than a week).

Looking on advice about groups and stuff to do. I enjoy historical (any era before Cold War, especially early industrial, Victorian, World Wars periods.), cultural, and nature stuff. 

Major countries/cities apart from Ireland and UK I would like to visit are: Portugal (especially Madeira and Lisbon), Madrid and Seville, most of Italy, Austria , Hungry, Czechia, Switzerland, Benelux region, Berlin, Rhine and Bavaria regions in Germany, major cities in Poland, Scandinavia, France (Breton and Normandy regions, Bordeaux, Lyon, Paris, Vimy Ridge). Balkans are a bit iffy for me at the moment (do want do a Romanian/Moldova or a Greek trip as well as visit Istanbul at some point)

 Also advice on accommodations would be great. Also any idea on finding work over there would be great also ( I am looking on job board and UK government site) I am willing do labour and kitchen work but also looking into transportation and admin/econ sectors. I have a major in Business admin and minor in economics. Also what visas I need for Europe apart from the new one they are introducing next year. 

Also if their are better reddits/blogs for this, send them my way please!

Ps. I don't plan on going any where close to Russia atm. Tho I do want to visit the Baltic's, Ukraine, Belarus and Finland **if** the situations does improved. Also all of this doesn't have to be one trip, it can be multiple and later in my life. Just want get some ideas of whats possible and whats not. ",2024-11-12 22:30:47

I'm experiencing intense guilt that I thought I could spend 7 days in kazakhstan without telling them.

I have spent $846 USD for non refundable flight tickets and now wanting to cancel the trip because of the intense guilt.
other fears also came up such as:
- i just read about the smog and air pollution https://www.reddit.com/r/Kazakhstan/s/BQ5wmVCZpi 
- im afraid of dying during the 7h flight

I feel so stupid for being impulsive in buying those flight tickets.
please help me what to do from here:

option A
fly there without telling my family

option B
a week before the trip, tell my family and insist on going whatever they say

option C
my flight will go from SG to KL (1hr flight), KL to almaty. and return flight is astana to KL, KL to SG. im thinking i can go to KL without going to kazakhstan? but im not sure if this is allowed. im visa free in KL but my flights are supposed to for transit only in KL, im not sure if anyone will question me

option D
try to ask airasia if i can convert the tickets to credits, although im unsure if its possible

please advise, losing sleep over this. i feel so dumb

solotravel,1gpra8v,"Solo, self-driving safari in Kruger National Park",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gpra8v/solo_selfdriving_safari_in_kruger_national_park/,1,"Hello, 



I've planned a solo, self-driving safari in the Kruger Park. I've already booked accommodation inside the park but as the trip was not planned far in advance, I had to book the rest camps based on their availability during my visit and tried to make it as reasonable/doable as possible but while I was double checking the plan, I realized that I might have under estimated the distances between rest camps. 



My plan is as follows: 



1st night in Skukuza

2nd night in Lower Sabbie

3rd night in Satara

4th night in Letaba

5th night in Tamboti 



On check-out day I also need to drop off my rental car in Skukuza Airport and take a flight to Cape Town at 11:40.



My questions are:



1- How long should I expect to travel between each camps? I've checked out the PDF showing distances and times between camps (which is very useful) however it estimates travelling speed at 25km/h. I am planning to drive between camps during lunchtime so my main concern will be to reach the next camp as fast as possible ( I will be doing game drives early in the morning and before sunset/guided night drives). So how long does it take to travel between these camps?



2- If I am not mistaken my longest drive will be from Tamboti to Skukuza Airport and I should be dropping off the rental car latest 10 am to catch my flight, which means I need to be at the airport around 9.30 to complete formalities, fueling up the car etc. So my question is what is the earliest time I can leave Tamboti camp to get to the airport around 9.30?



3- As I will be visiting during wet season, I think there is a high chance of heavy rainfall. How is the driving condition during/after rainfall? Should I expect sand roads to get muddy so much so that it's not possible to drive? This is particularly important on my last drive from Tamboti to Skukuza Airport, getting stuck in the mud and missing the flight would be a terrible experience after having a taste of Eden in the Kruger National Park!

  
Plus, any and all kind of (even if they are random ones) tips for this self driving safari trip is highly appreciated.

  
Thanks you in advance.

I think it's a pretty common route and set of activities, so I'll spare you the long and detailed trip report, but just as a very brief summary the things I enjoyed most were: the scenery in the Ha Giang Loop and Trang An (spectacular limestone karsts and mountains surrounded by lush greenery and emerald rivers), the temples in Angkor (I could have walked around them for days), and the street food (as a vegetarian, this was probably the first trip I've been on where I could enjoy proper local food, although it wasn't always easy). There were no major issues on the trip, I just had a few minor issues: I was sick on the day I planned to go to the Halfmoon party in Koh Phangan, some of the day trips were very touristy and a little underwhelming, and I nearly got caught out a couple of times with the travel (booking last-minute bus or train tickets wasn't quite as easy as I thought it would be).

Anyway, I just thought I'd make this post in case anybody else was planning a similar trip, and wanted to ask me about my experiences or general reflections on the places I visited. I'd be happy to share my thoughts, recommendations, and details of the costs, if that would be useful. ",2024-11-11 19:39:05
solotravel,1gpb5mp,January in Banff without skiing,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gpb5mp/january_in_banff_without_skiing/,8,"I’m deciding on a last minute trip in January and Banff is high on my list. I’m not much of a skier, but I love to hike/snowshoe. From my googling it seems like hiking with spikes solo or on a tour is feasible, but curious about first-hand experiences. Will hiking at lower elevations be a reasonable expectation? Will I be able to fill my time as a non-skier? Loosely thinking I can skate/snowshoe/find a dog-sledding tour, but don’t want to plan too far without knowing the vibes.",2024-11-12 03:09:27
solotravel,1gp3j1n,A Quick Sprint Across Peru (Trip Report),14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gp3j1n/a_quick_sprint_across_peru_trip_report/,18,"*About Me* 

M25, Canada, non-Spanish speaker. I’m a pretty experienced solo traveler (this was my fourth solo trip in three years, my previous ones being Germany & BeNeLux, Spain & Portugal, and Japan). I had 8 days of vacation remaining for the year, plus a day off in lieu due to taking a training course for work over a weekend, so I started looking for how to use them up. I ultimately decided on Peru as it was a new continent, seemed relatively safe and easy, sounded like a cheap country with cheap flights (more on this later), and I created an itinerary that saw everything I wanted to do in exactly the number of days I had to take off work, so I just booked it! 

*Budget:*  

I expected to spend around $4000 CAD on this trip. I ended up spending around $5500 CAD. There are a few reasons for overspending: 

1) Google Flights advertised that roundtrip flights to Lima would be around $850. However, it pulled these prices from those sketchy booking sites, not from LATAM directly, and those sites seem to have pulled their prices from LATAM in USD without converting to CAD. Flights ended costing around $1100 CAD. 

2) I got 6 Vaccines/Drugs for this trip (Yellow Fever, Typhoid, Tetanus Booster, Dukoral for Traveller’s Diarrhea, Anti-Malaria Pills, and an emergency Traveller’s Diarrhea), and I’m a healthy individual that doesn’t have any other prescriptions, so I didn’t hit my insurance’s deductible and had to pay the full $500 out of pocket. 

3) I booked several guided tours which is not something I’ve done for other trips. In particular, the Inca Trail tour was very expensive due to the permit required, and my Nazca tour was with a private guide. 

4) I bought $230 hiking boots for this trip that I included in these costs, but this is an investment I will continue to use for years to come. 

Despite these large expenses, overall Peru was extremely cheap. I joked that the prices in soles were often would I consider to be reasonable for the same product back home in CAD. For example, one day I had a fried trout for lunch for S/.16. Now, this meal would be completely reasonable at home for $16 CAD. But S/.16 is worth $5.90 CAD, almost a third of the price. 

I took S/.1500 with me, which lasted me until my second last day, when I had to withdraw S/.200 from an ATM. I then bought a bunch of souvenirs and had to withdraw \*another\* S/.200. I used ATMs at Banco de la Nación, which I don’t think charge any fees. You will probably get S/.100 bills, which are nearly impossible to spend since everything is so cheap. You also may end up with S/.0.10 and S/.0.20 coints, which are also impossible to spend because only psychopaths price things in fraction of a Sole. (Also shoutout to the hostel receptionist who give me my S/.30 change entirely in S/.1, S/.0.20, and S/.0.10 coins. I hope your pillow was warm that night.) 

*Trip Length*  

13 days including flights 

*Destination(s):*  

Lima (1 day), Huacachina (1 day), Nazca (1 day), Arequipa (2 days), Cusco (5 days including 2 day Inca Trail), Lima again (1 day) 

*Accommodation:*  

Pariwana Hostel in Lima, Banana’s Adventure in Huacachina, Arequipay Backpackers House in Arequipa, and Viajero Kokopelli Hostel in Cusco. I had no issues with any of the hostels. Bonus points for Viajero for having a filtered water dispenser! (S./7 for unlimited refills) 

*Activities:* 

Ballestas Islands: since I was short on time, I found a tour that only included the boat tour and not a tour of the Paracas Natural Reserve. My tour operator arranged transportation for me to and from Huacachina with other tours. I agreed to pay $20 USD for this, but no one ever asked me for the money so I never paid for it? (not complaining). Saqw lots of seabirds penguins, and sea lions, but I was honestly slightly underwhelmed by the amount of wildlife we saw. 

Huacachina Sand Buggy & Boarding: What a thrill! It was an intense experience and so much fun! I bought a face cover from a local seller and I was really glad I did (I still had sand din my teeth even with it). I booked this tour with my hostel and we were a small group of 6 (the sand buggy seats around 14). I wore my hiking boots for this and the next three times I wore them I was \*still\* pouring sand out of them. It was kind of depressing to see the piles of trash and water bottles at the bottom of the sand dunes, so please keep a hold of these items while riding. 

Huacachina in General: Huacachina is very nice and feels like a backpacker’s paradise. However, there isn’t enough to do to keep someone there more than a day or two. It would be the perfect spot to have a mid-trip rest day, but it’s proximity to Lima means that everybody there is either just starting or wrapping up their journey through Peru. 

Nazca Tour: I found a tour that included a Nazca flight and a private tour guide for Cahuachi, Chauchilla Cemetery, and the Cantalloc Aqueducts. It was the only way I found to visit all 4 attractions in one day. It cost  $189 USD, which I thought was very reasonable considering the flight on it’s own is $100 and I had a private guide for almost 6 hours. The flight was extra special because it was on a plane that only carried 2 people (most operators use planes that carry 6-10). Coincidentally, the other person was also on my bus from Huacachina to Nazca! She unfortunately suffered from some bad motion sickness on the plane, but I was completely fine. Nazca was such an interesting place, an entire civilization disappeared without leaving any written language, but the harsh desert protected the little evidence of their existence that remains today. 

Maria Reiche Planetarium: I just wanted to shout out this planetarium I happened to discover in Nazca. The man that runs it is just super passionate about astronomy, the Nazca Lines, and Maria Reiche, the woman that devoted her life to preserving the Nazca Lines. The show was very informative and I would highly recommending attending this show before your flight if possible to understand more about the lines and their discovery. 

Colca Canyon Tour: I took a one day bus tour of the Canyon. The tour starts at an ungodly 3am. It started off roughly the night before, when I started have stomach pains and diarrhea. Thank god the diarrhea ended before I needed to get on the bus, but the stomach issues got worse to the point I was dry heaving into a bus (fortunately there was nothing in my stomach to even throw up). Fortunately, my stomach issues started to clear up after breakfast, but then my altitude sickness started to kick in. I experienced a bad headache, lack of hunger, easily fatigued, and an inability to focus. My tour stopped at a hot springs to give us some time to soak, and this really helped clear up my symptoms. Unfortunately, the hot springs were at the bottom of a large staircase, and climbing the stairs brought all my symptoms back. I also bought some Coca candies but I did not find them to help. My illness had subsided by the time we returned to the lower altitude of Arequipa. Overall, it’s a very tough day, but I think it was highly worth it to see the views. I would have liked to trek the canyon instead of the single day bus tour, but there was no way I could have done it with my altitude sickness. 

Cusco FC Football Game: I went to a football game with some friends from my hostel in  Cusco. It was really fun! Tickets were only S/.10, general admission. There were a couple brass bands playing in the stands. People selling snacks and drinks in the stands, and I got a meal at halftime for only S./8 (some sort of beef & potato in sauce, served on rice and with a fried egg on top). Alcohol is not served. The game wasn’t very good, but hey, I’ve paid more to watch toddlers play. My friends more familiar with the sport noted that the game was much more violent than in Europe, and even I thought there were a couple blatant missed calls. The stadium in Cusco is also gorgeous. Curiously, you’re not allowed in the stadium with a belt, but a bar across the street was running a coat check for S/.2. One of my female friends laughed about this afterwards, as nobody checked her fanny pack which had a pocket knife inside. Cusco FC also has an awesome looking jersey (gold with the outline of Machu Picchu on it), I kind of regret not buying one. 

Sacred Valley Tour: An easy way to view the four Inca Archaeological Sites outside of Cusco. It’s nice because each site is at a lower elevation so the day gets easier as it goes on. It’s also the cheapest tour I took. You have to buy the tourist pass to access the sites separately, but you can upgrade to the full tourist pass that gives you access to other sites in and around Cusco. I bought this one and visited a few when I was back in Cusco. Honestly, those ones were pretty underwhelming, but I guess you can thank the Spanish for destroying every Inca monument they got their hands on. But the Sacred Valley is beautiful, you need to do one of these tours. 

Short Inca Trail Hike: the highlight of my trip! I didn’t have the time to do the full 3 day hike of the Inca Trail, so I did just the one day hike with Alpaca Expeditions. I chose the option that involved camping overnight, which Alpaca is the only operator (the other options stayed in hotels). I was slightly disappointed as I was hoping we would be camping on the trail, but we actually went to a campsite near Aguas Calientes instead. Alpaca was also the only operator who cooked a fresh meal for us on the trail for lunch (the other tours only got boxed lunches) and the food was amazing and the meals were huge. My group was small, only 4 people. I couldn’t imagine trying to hike in a group of up to 16. I actually found the hike really easy. Where I’m from, hikes usually involve climbing a mountain, which means consistent elevation gain. However, the Inca Trail has many flat sections, and we hiked at a slower pace than I’m used to, so it’s actually one of the easier hikes I’ve completed. I also didn’t have any issue with the elevation. It rained in the afternoon, and when we got the Sun Gate, Machu Picchu was obscured by clouds. However, just before we were about to leave, the clouds cleared, and we got to see the complex. And at the classic viewpoint, the clouds kept coming in and out, obscuring and revealing Machu Picchu. This was almost magical, having the cloud reveal Machu Picchu as if personally rewarding us for completing the hike. 

Machu Picchu: Our day in Machu Picchu had perfect weather, not a cloud in site. Our guide said we were very lucky, as it’s usually foggy the morning after a rainfall. It did make it hot and sweaty for our tour, but the views were amazing. I also booked the hike up Huyana Picchu, the mountain behind Machu Picchu. \*This\* hike was way more difficult, as it was constantly gaining elevation and involved multiple steep and narrow staircases. This hike is definitely not for those scared of heights, but it was definitely worth it! I forgot to check how long it took me to complete it, but it took me around a couple hours. 

*Transportation:* 

I did not use public transportation apart from the BRT on a walking tour to the historic centre. Uber was cheap and easy to use, so I used that when I needed to. 

Flight Home-Lima: there were no good flight options for me to get from my home to Peru. They all either involved like a 9 hour layover, a 1 hour layover in the busiest airports in America, or arrived at like 5am. I ended up taking a red eye from Calgary-Toronto, followed by Toronto-Cancun and then Cancun-Lima. I chose this option because it had layovers of comfortable lengths (\~3hrs each) and got the red eye out of the way first so I could go to bed when I got to Lima and start my trip fresh. Cancun SUCKS to connect in, never do it if you can help it. First, they make you pay the entry tax to Mexico, even if you aren’t staying in the country (they’ll check for your receipt when you depart). Then, I had to switch terminals, which involved a bus ride. There is a free shuttle every 20 minutes, but as soon as you leave the terminal you get swarmed with scammers trying to convince you that the shuttle is terrible and that you’re going to miss your flight if you don’t pay them $50 to drive you over (Meanwhile the shuttle was sitting RIGHT THERE at the terminal). They confused me enough to miss that shuttle, but I got my bearings back and refused their offers even as they haggled down to $20. I caught the shuttle, it was a 4-minute drive to my terminal, and I did not miss my flight. There is no potable water so you need to buy their overpriced bottles, and the wifi logs you out automatically every 30min. All three of my flights ended up being short haul narrow body flights, so despite the 18 hour travel day, I did not get a single meal on any of the flights (apart from a shitty sandwich on the third). Finally, they never checked for my tax receipt. I used Quickllama Shuttle to get to and from Lima Airport, it was only S/.20 and dropped off in Miraflores literally around the corner from my hostel. They were good except this irst flight, when they were delayed due to a traffic accident. 

Lima-Ica Bus: I went with a 6pm Cruz del Sur. I was going to book on PeruBus as it was cheaper, but I preferred the departure time of this Cruz del Sur. Their website would not work with my details, so I booked on Busbud instead and it worked fine. However, they cancelled my bus and put me on another one an hour and a half later without telling me. This really pissed me off, because I specifically booked this bus for the departure time. Plus, if I had been notified earlier, I would have gone to another museum in Lima, and the bus depot is in a rougher area of the city so there’s nothing to do except wait for 90 minutes in the bus station. They do have a luggage check, you get a receipt that they check at your destination so they can make sure it’s actually you grabbing your bags. There is no Uber in Ica. There were taxis waiting to pick me up inside the bus lot itself, and there was a sign with predetermined prices to different areas of the city so that you don’t get scammed (S/.20 to get to Huacachina) 

Huacachina-Nazca Shuttle Bus: I found this Wayki Bus that picked up directly in front of my hostel. It was just a small passenger van that was a tourist shuttle. It even included a stop at the Nazca Lines tower (included admission). I was sitting up front beside the driver. At one point the driver did the sign of the cross, which kind of freaked me out. \*We’ve been fine on our own for the rest of trip, what’s about to come that NOW we need God’s help!?\* (it was a single lane tunnel and a very narrow switchback down into a valley). Overall, this shuttle was super convenient, and the only option I found online to get me from Huacachina/Ica to Nazca in the morning. 

Nazca-Arequipa Bus: Another Cruz del Sur. This was a 10-hour overnight bus, and honestly, was amazing. The seats are very wide in a 2-1 layout, and reclined almost flat to 160 degrees. I took my melatonin and conked out for most of the night. They gave us a pitiful snack bag with a juice box, saltine crackers, and some chocolate quinoa bar thqat was honestly the best granola bar I’ve ever had. I did not like that the bathroom had a urinal that was right in your face while sitting on the toilet 

Arequipa-Cusco Flight: Pretty typical early morning 1-hour flight. In hindsight, I probably would’ve taken the bus instead (approx. 10 hours overnight), as it was cheaper, didn’t involve waking up early for, and I just didn’t expect the overnight bus from Nazca to Arequipa to be as great as it actually was. I chose the flight because I wanted an extra evening in Arequipa, but I didn’t end up doing anything that evening anyways. Although some people I met that took the bus on this route did not seem to have as positive experience as I did on the Nazca route, so maybe it is better I took the flight. 

Cusco-Lima Flight: A typical, 90 minute flight. No way would I replace this flight with a bus (\~20 hours). I arrived at the airport, pulled up my boarding pass to go through security...and discovered that my flight was cancelled. Fortunately, there’s a flight between Cusco and Lima like every 10 minutes, so I was only a half hour later. 

Lima-Home Flight: This time I connected through Los Angeles. So, it turns out that there are no restrictions on liquids on flights in Peru (would have been nice to know for my other flights). HOWEVER, for flights to the US and Canada, large liquids are not allowed on the plane period, even if purchased after security, so I had to chug my bottle before getting on the plane. Other than that, the flight was fine. US Customs asks too many questions and the line was too long. 

*What Went Right:*  

Except for that one night, I had no stomach issues. I got to see everything I planned to. I got to try Grilled Alpaca and Guinea Pig and enjoyed both (Alpaca has the texture of a beef steak and the taste of a porkchop. The guinea pig was like chicken dark meat except way more flavourful, lots of little bones though).  

For the most part I stayed in the touristic areas and felt safe the entire time. I once wondered out of the touristic historic centre in Lima, and the only thing I noticed was that people stopped trying to sell me stuff. I was worried about waiting for my bus after dark in Nazca, as I didn’t have a hostel there to hide in if things ended up being unsafe, but all those fears were dispelled when I saw tons of kids paying in the main plaza. Someone even had these neon lit motor cars that kids could drive around the plaza. 

Altitude Sickness did not impact me as much as I feared it would. I come from a city located at about 1000m. In Arequipa (2300m), I felt a little more tired climbing stairs than normal. Colca Canyon (3600-4900m) was where it was worst. In Cusco (3400m) I would get super tired climbing stairs but I recovered quickly. And I didn’t have any isues on the Inca Trail (2600m) at all. 

*What Went Wrong:*  

Holy shit drivers in Peru are INSANE. Lanes don’t matter, honking all the time, drivers don’t stop for pedestrians, cutting corners on the highways over double yellows, passing fuel trucks only to cut back over before they’ve fully passed it so you don’t hit a truck in the opposite direction head on... I don’t know how they do it! I met some people from other South American countries if their drivers were as crazy as Peru, checking to see if it’s just a South American thing, and they all agreed, no, Peruvian drivers are just uniquely bad. 

Be prepared that everyone is trying to sell you something. Snacks, drinks, souvenirs, tours, their restaurant. I don’t think any of them are trying to scam you, they are just very insistent with tourists, and I just found it very overwhelming. (also, the people with folders of paintings they are selling for S/.1, it’s a drug front. Use that information as you wish). 

I don’t know what I was thinking, but I massively underestimated how much data I needed and had to top up my eSIM twice (I ended up using 6GB) 

*Recommendations:*  

If any site you visit has guides for hire, do it! The price is usually reasonable and they provide so much better information than you’d be able to find on your own. Especially at Saqsaywaman in Cusco, my guide was able to point out all the animals in the stones I would have never found otherwise and shared some compelling conspiracy theories on how the temple was built. 

I think my itinerary would have been improved with one extra day, and pushing my Huacachina and Nazca schedule back half a day. I would also have flown from Cusco to Lima earlier in the day. This is because I didn’t really have any evenings in Lima, so I didn’t get to fully enjoy the nightlife there. 

*Final Verdict:*  

Peru is an amazing country with a huge variety of landscapes and climates available within a relatively small geographical area. It has lots to offer for nature lovers, adventure seekers, archaeology geeks, and everyone in between. It’s very cheap once you actually get here, and is still relatively safe and easy to visit. I would highly recommend this country as anyone’s introduction to South America.

Hey everyone! I’m planning a trip to Spain and could use some help fine-tuning my itinerary. Here’s the plan so far:

Arrival: I’ll be landing in Madrid on November 22nd.

Departure: My flight back to the U.S. is from Madrid on December 3rd at 6 AM.

Madrid Game: I’m planning to attend the Real Madrid game on December 1st.


Current Itinerary Ideas:

I have about 11 days and am looking to explore a few key cities in Spain. Here are the destinations I’m considering:

1. Madrid – Of course, I’ll be spending some time here at the start and end of my trip.


2. Seville – High on my list for its culture and beautiful landmarks.


3. Toledo (maybe) – Not sure if I’ll have time for a full day trip here.


4. Malaga – Interested in the beaches and relaxed atmosphere.


5. Granada – Primarily for the Alhambra.


6. Valencia – Want to explore the City of Arts and Sciences and possibly the beach.



Questions:

Is this itinerary realistic for 11 days, or should I consider cutting a city?

Any other cities you’d recommend adding or swapping, especially considering I’ll be going to the Madrid game on December 1st?

Tips for transportation between these cities (train, bus, or car rental)?

Must-see spots or unique experiences in these cities?


Thanks in advance for any insights or recommendations you can provide!",2024-11-12 07:59:38

Edit: thank you for all the responses! I just wanted to clarify what’s on this list aren’t things I have to do. Just general ideas. I usually pick a focal point in a location and go there and then have my day just organically happen from it. I appreciate all the concern of me trying to do to much though.


Hey hey! I'm stoked to have joined this sub. I’m finally traveling independently after realizing that I don't have to wait for others.  I started venturing solo within the U.S. last year, and I’ve discovered that I love it! Now, I’m heading to Madrid to kick off my journey of international adventures. I’ve seen others post their travel idea lists here, and I’d love to get your feedback, tips, or anything you think could be helpful.

A bit about me: I’m a 35-year-old mental health therapist, so I’m very comfortable with conversation and making connections—maybe a little too comfortable at times! I’m passionate about food, and drinks, exploring new places, and dancing at clubs and shows (EDM, rap, metal, hardcore). I also love going to parties, diving into film and art, going to places that encourage presence and mindfulness, and exploring off the beaten path. So Far I just have the flight booked. 

Here are the notes I have so far. I am still working on how much clothes to pack as I tend to overpack haha

many  
**Trip Overview**

* **Dates**: March 18th–27th (9 days total: 7 days for sightseeing, 2 days for travel)
* **Arrival**: March 19th
* **Departure**: March 27th

**Lodging**

* **Primary option**: Airbnb
* **Consideration**: Hostel (for socializing and meeting people, but note I’m a light sleeper. I use earplugs and a sleep mask, but sometimes that’s not enough).
* **Check-in**: March 19th
* **Check-out**: March 27th

**Travel, Packing, and Tips**

* **Food**:
   * Avoid paella in the city center (likely frozen)
   * Don’t order sangria in touristy areas
   * Raciones are large plates of tapas (they’re more expensive than typical tapas)
   * Watch out for your wallet and bag—keep it on the front
   * Don’t skip the ""menu of the day"" (great value for a full meal)
   * Skip buying bottled water in Madrid (tap water is excellent)
* **Transportation**:
   * Walk around, but use the metro for longer distances. Consider getting a travel card (10 rides for €7).
   * For airport transport, a cab is typically better than Uber.
* **Money**:
   * Hit an ATM for cash (there’s usually a fee, so only withdraw what you need).
   * Consider using a budget tool for Madrid: [The Savvy Backpacker’s Budget Guide](https://thesavvybackpacker.com/city-guide/daily-costs-visit-madrid/).
* **Safety/Health**:
   * Bring a ziplock bag for your phone (in case of rain or spills).
   * Consider a cut-proof crossbody bag for extra security.
   * Turn off the clock on your phone when traveling to avoid jet lag. Once breakfast is served on the plane, brush your teeth, wash your face, and act like you're starting the day. If you're tired, take a short nap (90 minutes max).
* **Jet Lag Trick**: Turn off your phone’s clock or hide it in a random location. Avoid looking at clocks to help adjust.
* **Miscellaneous**:
   * Copy important documents (passport, travel insurance, etc.) in case you lose them.
   * Pack an RFID money belt for extra security.
* **Bag I am bringing**
* Carryon osprey sojourn porter 40L or just a large backpack with multiple pockets. I haven't decided yet.

**What I am packing**

**Food to Try**

* **Arroz Caldoso** (traditional, made fresh)

It is my first trip outside Europe, so it’s a kinda big deal for me, but I’m glad I did it because I was able to challenge myself that way. I am learning a lot about myself and my ability to adapt to new situations.
The other part that I am working on is to be able to connect to others. I tried to take part of tours, or simply go to a bar to listen to live music. At most, I will exchange a few words with some people and that’s it… then I have the feeling to be considered an alien, because I’m by myself… in my bubble… 

There is still this side of me that is shy. Probably others around feel it and this is causing this sort of mental block, I don’t know… Thanks god I know a few people from work that live here so we could go for a meal or a drink, but I can’t expect them to be with me at all times…

Have you been through that and how did you cope? I’d love to hear about your own experiences… 

Thank you and happy trips to all! ",2024-11-12 04:30:29

* When you're on the road, how do you capture your best moments?
* What makes a photo a special memory for you? Is it the spontaneity, the analogue feeling, or something completely different?
* Would you rather use a camera that is simple and spontaneous, or do you need a device that takes more professional pictures?
* How important is it to you that you can see the photos straight away, for example with a Polaroid or digital camera, as opposed to developing them later with a disposable camera?
* For those who have used disposable cameras: What did you love about them? Are there things you miss or would do differently?

I’m currently planning a solo trip around West Africa, I have both the UK and Irish passport as I currently live in Northern Ireland.

My current Itinerary is… Morocco (Marrakesh and Casablanca), Mauritania (Nouakchott), Senegal (Dakar), The Gambia (Banjul), Guinea-Bissau (Bissau), Guinea (Conakry), Sierra Leone (Freetown) and Liberia (Monrovia).

I like fast paced travelling only staying in the one city for 2-4 nights before moving the next, just wandering if anyone has any tips or information about how difficult or easy their experience getting Visa’s were, or if there is any recommendations for cities I should stop at on my travels.

Budgeting on this trip is not a huge problem and just like to experience and explore without thinking too much about the cost of it. I prefer the atmosphere of hostels but understand these are not widely available in this part of the world yet. 

In terms of travel I’m not sure what is most convenient; whether or not to fly where I can or experience the local buses from city to city.

solotravel,1go61fl,"Short 3 day trip to Bucharest, Romania",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1go61fl/short_3_day_trip_to_bucharest_romania/,7,"Booked a very last minute short solo 3 day trip to Bucharest Romania with Ryanair when they had flash sales and this is what I did. Might help someone thinking of a similar short trip. My itinerary included only key major landmark attractions, and excluded the museums, restaurants to try and thermal spa due to time. All in all very enjoyable, and there’s definitely room for improvement in investment and marketing in the Romanian tourism industry.

**Practical info** =  
100 Lei (£18) withdrawn from local ATM (any bank is fine and avoid Euronet/airport exchanges). Revolut contactless card widely used, including some market stalls. Felt safe throughout my whole trip but of course be vigilant as you would be normally.

**Day 1** = Flew out of Stansted airport arrived Bucharest around 8.40pm. Took the No 100 bus which is literally outside of the ground floor arrivals hall. I paid 3 Lei on the machine inside the bus, making sure all lights were green and you hear a beep. Journey took 40 minutes to Piata Romana, close to where the majority of the hotels are, and walkable to Old Town area. Grabbed dinner at a burger joint from across the hotel.

**Day 2** = I booked a day tour with GetYourGuide. It was an extremely long but worthwhile day. Bus pickup from Piata Universitatii, at 7.15am. There’s a couple of toilet break stops during the entire journey at service stations which was useful. 

First stop Peles Castle – we waited no more than 10-15 min as we were quite early and helps it was on a weekday. Have read stories where queues could be up to 3 hours long. Our guide was really good explaining the history of the various rooms, which were really grand and opulent. Now the tour only covered the first floor. For 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) floors, additional tickets have to be purchased separately. The outside of the castle was unfortunately covered in scaffolding in one section, but beautiful nonetheless. Mountain views were breathtaking.

Next stop Bran Castle. Call it a tourist trap with all that tacky Dracula connection but I enjoyed and just rolled with it. Still had leftover Halloween decorations. Its small but the castle history is quite interesting. In the market area outside, you have your usual souvenir gifts and food vendors.

Last stop Brasov. Beautiful small town, has its own Hollywood type sign on the mountains, a massive black church, town square, main promenade has assorted eateries, shops, cafes, money exchange. From there it was a 3.5 hour drive back to Bucharest, arrived at the same pick up point at 9pm.

**Day 3** = Took the metro to the Village Museum, which showcases the historical Romanian village life. Many of the buildings were locked, but there were a few that allow you to look inside and take pictures. Spent just under 2 hours here. Then a quick wander around Herastrau Park. 

Then it’s off to Palace of Parliament (did not do tour, only took pictures outside), Stavropoleos Monastery, Revolution Square, Old town with its variety of restaurants, cafes and shops. If you prefer, there’s always a free walking tour you can join. After a late lunch, then back on the No 100 bus to the airport.

Foodwise ate ribs, sausages, cabbage rolls, papanasi, and drank Romanian wine, coffee, based on random google searches for restaurants.",2024-11-10 17:36:55

I have never traveled by myself before. The election has reminded me of my love for history, specifically learning about the US presidents and the history of our country in general. I have been to DC once on a school trip ten years ago and have always wanted to go back, especially now that I can appreciate it more as an adult. Would DC be a good place to have your first solo trip? 

 I plan to go for about 3 or 4 days. I want to go on a guided tour of the city, visit the holocaust museum, and im still looking into other activities I can do there. 

 I’ve never traveled alone but im tired of waiting for someone to go with me. Ever since I was a kid I have wanted to travel and was never able to unless it was a school trip or a friend invited me on their family vacation. Now, as an adult, I have the money to do so, but not the guts to do it by myself. Over the years I have asked every friend I have to go with me to numerous locations (all in the US and some that were not even all that far away) and every single person I asked has told me no. Ive also asked every family member I am close to, and they too, are unwilling to go anywhere. I’ve decided I can’t just sit around letting other people dictate what I do with my life. I can’t spend another year or 2 or 3 sitting around hoping someone will finally tell me yes. It’s depressing and sad. I can’t rely on other people to fulfill my dreams and this is something I want to do, but as a young woman it just makes me nervous. However I feel that if I do do this, it will bring me so much confidence.  

 3 years ago I actually did go on a 3 day trip to NYC with a friend. I planned everything out and was kind of the one “in charge” of the trip so to speak, and it went good. We didn’t get lost (at least not for longer than 20 minutes lol), I even had to deal with a man that was harassing me and I think i handled the situation as best I could. However it brought me peace of mind knowing I wasn’t completely alone and that if something went wrong I wasn’t all by myself. 

Basically I guess im just asking for solo travel tips (and motivation to actually do it)  and wondering if DC is a good place to go by yourself. ",2024-11-10 16:42:45

**Day 1-4** Santa Marta & the North. My flight lands in Cartagena in the early afternoon, so I’ll need to bus 4-5 hrs to Santa Marta that evening or early morning on day 2. I want to do an overnight stay in Parque Tayrona for sure, and either spend a night at the Rio Hostel Buritaca or spend a night in Minca (don’t think I have time for both).

I know we don’t have Bogota or the lost city hike scheduled in. Unfortunately I just don’t think I can make those happen on this trip.

* How would you do the first 4 days? Is Minca skip-able if I have so much time in the coffee region later – it seems like they offer similar activities? Is Rio Hostel Buritaca worth it? Any way I can do both??

* Doing a floating sauna is a must. Highlight of my trip

* If possible, I'd aim to see an opera or ballet at the Opera House - it was not so expensive and it was marvellous

* Kon-tiki museum, Fram museum and Maritime Museum were not very interesting to me. I'd skip them. The cultural history museum, however, was worth it just to see the Gol Stave Church

* The food is insanely expensive. I ended up just having street and fast food u- but I really enjoyed Max and had plenty of hot dogs and waffles. Freya chocolate is also quite nice!

I am traveling to Angkor Wat this January, and had a question about logistics/planning.

I plan to head over from Phnom Penh and to stay in Siem Reap for 3 in total. Ideally I would spend as much time at Angkor Wat as possible in this time.

The earliest bus with Giant Ibis leaves at 8:45 and takes 6 hours, so assuming minimal delays I would get there by 2:45/3:00 PM. Is this enough time to make it to Angkor Wat by sunset and see some temples? I am assuming not but wanted to ask.

The other option of course is flying, which would get me there for 9:20 and leave me more time during that same day to explore. I would like to avoid flying if preferable but this may be the better option.

Lastly, there are overnight buses but some reviews online suggest to avoid these. Does anyone have experience with an overnight Giant Ibis bus? Would save a bit of money and allow me to avoid having to fly, but if it's going to be noticeably more uncomfortable then it wouldn't be worth it.

I lived in Korea for a few years, but I learned a lot of Korean before I went. Whenever I'd try to talk and couldn't express myself properly, I would get really embarrassed. At that point, I would give up and use an app to translate, I would give up and leave, or they would start speaking English. From what I've heard, Korea is one of the better countries at English in Asia, but there were still plenty of people that weren't capable of communicating. 

This language barrier caused me a lot of anxiety and made me feel ashamed of myself. I had friends who went to places like Mongolia and Turkey and Greece. But I don't see how they could've gotten around or done anything without speaking to people.

solotravel,1gmkdyi,Why has couchsurfing dwindled so much as a social norm?,334,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gmkdyi/why_has_couchsurfing_dwindled_so_much_as_a_social/,281,"Perhaps this is an esoteric take, but couchsurfing is such a beautiful idea in principle. It is the antithesis of voyeuristic tourism. Couch surfing has enabled me to directly engage with the locals and to explore their cities through their eyes. The few times I used couchsurfing apps (warmshowers primarily) this past year had given me some really positive, memorable, eye-opening experiences. 

This leads me to wonder: why has couch surfing dwindled so much as a social norm over the past decade? While I don't know the exact data around number of couchsurfers over the years, couchsurfing has definitely [declined in its cultural relevance](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=couchsurfing&hl=en) with its peak in 2013.

People argue that Airbnb is one of the main drivers of such decline. But Airbnb provides a different functionalities than couchsurfing platforms. Professionalized vacation rentals sells privacy, comfort, and predictability; whereas couchsurfers use couchsurfing platforms to seek out and to befriend locals. Airbnb's ease and budget-friendliness has taken away couchsurfers who only couchsurf to save money, which I imagine is a lot of people. But surely there are still millions of people who want to couchsurf primarily as a way to meet others? Would love some reality check here. 

The huge fumble by [couchsurfing.com](http://couchsurfing.com) also can't possibly be the main reason why couchsurfing has lost its entire appeal either. Several alternatives that are community-driven, non-profit, and free exist today, like [couchers.org](http://couchers.org), [bewelcome.org](http://bewelcome.org), and warmshowers.org. None of these platforms have successfully revived couchsurfing despite their improvements and are focused on a small community of users.  

Maybe couch surfing had always just been a niche way to travel. Maybe I am idealizing over how often couchsurfing is actually fun for others. For those who still couchsurf, how is ur experience these days and which platforms do u use? What is the biggest pain point for you? Why do u not use it not as frequently any more? And for those who haven't tried it, what makes u hesitant? ",2024-11-08 14:55:41

I will be travelling to Sri Lanka in a couple of days and I want to rent a scooter for most of the trip. 

The itinerary is 
Colombo - Sigirya - Kandy - Nuwara Eliya - Ella - Bentota - Colombo.

But, for this trip, I want to go from Kandy to Nuwara, or even Ella, by train, and here is where the problem appears.

I would like to either book a scooter in Colombo and drop it in Kandy, then book another scooter in Nuwara / Ella, that I can drop in Colombo...

Or get the scooter somehow from Kandy to Nuwara / Ella... 

Do you know of any agency that could help with any of those options? 

I assume that you can't take the scooter in the train, like in Vietnam, right? And I can't have someone unknown to the rental agency drive it between those two stations either...

I know only about Sri Lanka Bike Rental, but I am not happy with their prices: $50 to drop it in Kandy and another $50 to pick it from Nuwara / Ella.",2024-11-10 04:21:40

It was my reason for working and I have fond memories of the cultures, cities, romances, and friends I had met and experienced over the years.

When the world shut down, I had to move back to the States, where I eventually found new work and at the time decided to finally finish my bachleor's in an online program. I had told myself I wouldn't travel until I finished school, as I was still working full-time to ensure I didn't go into debt.

It's been a busy couple years and I sometimes felt sad that I might have lost the travel part of my identity. I was somewhat saved by a southwest road trip with long-time friends in 2022 and was thankful for that. Newer friends that I've met post-Covid don't even know me as the type that goes anywhere. I had gotten into watching a few travel YouTube channels to live vicariously through them to try to keep that part of my identity alive.

I finished school earlier this year and my birthday is at the end of the month. I had planned to finally travel at that time. My plan to travel in late this year was almost derailed after I started suffering from some pain in September that the doctor's haven't been able to diagnose. It's been a stressful few months. However, as of a few weeks ago, I've suddenly been feeling much better and seem to be coming out of the hole.

My hobby is a cyclist and while I have still have little body pain, I have returned to doing 30 mile rides and have felt fine the next day. 

So here I am emailing a bicycle rental shop in Taipei and then buying air tix this weekend to fly out next week for 3 weeks of my saved vacation to attempt my dream trip of cycling the famous Route 1 in Taiwan. I have visited a few times before but always for shorter trips. It's always been my favorite country to visit and it feels right for it to be my first trip before I hit up new countries I've been wanting to visit next year.

solotravel,1glze0n,Solo travel report: Europe in 27 days.,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1glze0n/solo_travel_report_europe_in_27_days/,31,"I did a solo trip around Europe and now I'm feeling motivated to share my experience in a post considering that some of the advices I saw in the chanel helped me a lot before and during my trip, so maybe something I mention here could be helpful for other person. 

  
This was my schedule: 

\-Madrid (4 days)

\-Barcelona (3 days)

\-Paris (4 days)

\-Brussels (1 day)

\-Amsterdam (2 days)

\-Berlin (2 days)

\-Prague (2 days)

\-Venice (1 day)

\-Florence (2 days)

\-Pisa (1 day)

\-Rome (3 days)

  
Before continue I'd like to give a little context and is that I'm traveling from Argentina (12 hours flight to Madrid) and a week before my trip started I received an email from the airline mentioning that my flight has a 5 hour delay. I did some research and I was able to schedule a new flight a day earlier (and spend 1+ night in Madrid). Also I receive a compensation of 600 euros, so if you have a similar situation please check with the airline because probably you should be compensated too (this is a matter of law in Europe). Maybe for people from Europe this is normal, but thinking in a situation like this coming from Latinamerica is actually insane. 

Other topic I'd like to mention is that some weeks before my travel I posted a question about how much money I should take with me for food/public transportation ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f1qlge/going\_to\_some\_cities\_in\_europe\_for\_27\_days\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f1qlge/going_to_some_cities_in_europe_for_27_days_how/) ). In that post I got a lot of criticism on how much travel I was doing for the short period of time and blah blah. After doing the trip I can tell you that for me the schedule works almost perfect (there is only a detail I regret but I'm gonna mention this later). Considering that I was solo, the tours I wanted to do and the type of turism I like, it worked perfect for me so cool if you think that you should stay a week in Berlin, 2 days for me was enough. About the question how much money I should take for food/public transportation for my trip, considering that the obvious answer is depend on how much you drink and eat on fancy or cheap places, the answer for me was 50 euros per day (magnets and gifts not included). 

So I started my journey in Madrid, first day I did a solo tour that I think it was ok but not great. I think Madrid have a lot in common with Buenos Aires where I live and I actually had a great time. I visited Santiago Bernabeu Stadium (it was impressive but all the museum part is meh if you dont like soccer), and also did the 3 more important museums (Reina Sofia, Thyssen and Prado). My favorite one was Museo del Prado, definitely one of the highest moments on the trip. Also I did. the tour of the Madrid Royal Palace and I reccomend 100%. I was able to do some shopping in Madrid and save a luggage with a friend and something cool about Madrid is that you can actually have the tax free with no minimum amount (in Paris was 100 euros or more I think). So Madrid I think it's the best city for shopping (if you're a normal person who likes Uniqlo, el corte inglés, Zara, etc). 

In Barcelona I went to some of the Gaudí constructions but for me the most impressives are La Pedrera and La Sagrada Familia (this one is a must and was other top moment of my trip). I was also able to do the tours in both and it was pretty cool, specially la sagrada familia. La casa Batlló, Park Guell and Palau Guell they were fine but for me it was not super impressive (the experience was worth it). Barrio Gótico and El Born were two excelent walks. I also did some walk on Barcelona pier and the beach at night and it was amazing. But Barcelona have a great issue and is that a guy tried to rob me at the end of my last day (if you wanna know the story is posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7u4oo/a\_guy\_tried\_to\_rob\_me\_in\_barcelona\_during\_my\_solo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7u4oo/a_guy_tried_to_rob_me_in_barcelona_during_my_solo/) ). If it weren't for this detail, Barcelona would be among my top places I visited.

Then I moved to Paris and Paris was my favorite city in terms of infrastructure and construction. I had a great moment when in my first day I saw Eiffel Tower for the first time (another highlight of the trip). During my second day I went to the Louvre that for me it was a dream come true, to Napoleon Tomb (amazing) and the Pantheón. In the 3rd day I had an amazing experience in Disneyland and for my last day I spent the morning in Versalles. The palace is impressive outside and the gardens are amazing but inside I think (and this is my opinion) that the Madrid Royal Palace is more impressive (again, don't kill me, is just an opinion). Versalles it was a good experience but I think I was expecting more inside the Palace. I finished Paris visiting Opera Garnier (a must on my opinion) and doing some walk on Barrio Latino.

My next stop was Brussels and I think is a very interesting city with a lot of random stuff (the fact that nobody knows why one of their major attractions is a statue of a child urinating seemed at least curious to me). The Grand Place it was other top moment of my trip. The square is absurdly beautiful. I meet with a friend to eat mejillones and it was good. A day in Brussels for me to know the most interesting things in the city was enough. 

The Amsterdam day arrives and omg...we all know how is the situation on Amsterdam, we all know about the red light districts, the windows, the girls, drugs, etc. But being there and seeing it live blew my mind. Besides this aspect of the city, I think that the city is BEAUTIFUL. It was my third favorite city in all the trip. In my opinion the canals in Amsterdam are much prettier than the canals in Venice (again, this is an opinion, please don't kill me). Ana Frank house is a must in the city (amazing experience) and the Rijkmuseuum was very good too. In Amsterdam I lived what I think it was the top moments of my trip, and is that I tried mushrooms. I'm not going to talk about this experience in detail because I do not intend to make an apology for drugs (the only drug I tried before this was marihuana and I don't even drink alcohol lol). 

In Amsterdam also happened the most strestful moment of my trip, and is that my train to Berlin left at 11:05pm. I traveled with European Sleeper, so I arrived to the station at 9:45pm. Checking the screens I noticed that my train didn't appear, so I checked the ticket and it turns out my train wasn’t leaving from Amsterdam, but from AMERSFOORT. Imagine my face at that moment when I didn’t even know if Amersfoort was a place in the Netherlands lol. By the way, I had bought the ticket months ago and I hadn’t realized this. Luckily, Amersfoort is a city 45 minutes away by train and there was a train leaving from Amsterdam to Amersfoort at 9:55pm and I managed to get there. It was a journey too because when I arrived in Amersfoort the QR code didn’t work, there was no one at the station, the train was delayed, basically everything happened to me. Luckily, I was able to get to Berlin.

My first day in Berlin I was very tired (for obvious reasons) but I managed to have a good time because I met and stayed with a friend who lives there. I spend two days with her and it was a nice experience. Not much to say besides that the city have some great buildings and monuments. Maybe something I didn't like a lot is that as tourist it looks like everything is related to the WW2 and the wall and I'm more into art and museums maybe. 

My next stop was Prague and I have to say this was my second favorite city of the trip. The one that surprises me most. I didn't expect anything from Prague and I had a blast. I did the free tour that it was really good. I loved the vibe of the city, the castle, the watch, the bridge...everything. I think that in Prague and Barcelona were the places where I saw the prettiest girls in my whole trip (I'm single and I had a tinder date in Prague lol). In conclusion, I need to live in Prague for a while.

Venice in a day was perfect for me. I think that going Venice on your own is a good plan if you're a fan of the concept of the city (I realize there that is not my case). I did a couple tours (Basilica de San Marcos and Palacio Ducal) and did a lot of walking but my feeling was that if I stayed for another complete day, I probably would have gotten bored. 

Florence was one of my favorite places. The views from the top of the dome of the basílica is a must in Florence. Also other top moment of my trip was visiting the Uffizi Gallery and Gallery Academy (seeing the David statue was another dream come true). The food was also amazing here. I went to a fancy restorant and ordered a Tomato Soup that blows my mind. Florence is one of the places I would definitely visit again.

And now is moment of talking about Pisa and here is my only regret with the itinerary. My train arrived Pisa at 8am, and my train to rome was schedule at 9pm (13 hour in Pisa). I think that I spent too many time here. 7 hours was time enough for me to visit the city so at 5pm I was already bored (maybe there is people that spent 3 days in Pisa and had a great time and that's ok too). The tower was pretty cool and have some nice views from the top. I think this is one of the places I wouldn't visit it again because I don't think it has much more to offer me. I visited a couple museums too  but nothing that seemed too incredible to me.

And my last stop was Rome. Amazing city. It's an open-air museum. The food was amazing. I eat a Lasagna that was 10/10. I also eat the best tiramisú that I have eaten in life (the place is called ""Best tiramisu to go""). I did the guided tour of the Roman Coliseum and it was good, but my favorite attractions from Rome was the Pantheon (the first time I saw the Pantheon I said ""holy sh\*t"") and the guided tour to the vatican (museums and Saint Peter church). This last one is a must on Rome.  

The whole trip was an amazing experience. I reccomend to everyone. I'm trying to repeat the next year with some modifications on my schedule (I'd like to visit Copenhague, Budapest, Zurich and Munich for example). Sorry for my english and thanks for reading :)

I, 23F, have been working and in school pretty much my whole life. I graduate in December and will have at least 7mths before I go on to do more schooling. I've never done completely solo travel, and while financially my life is not great, I know with at least a month or two of full-time work after graduating that I could afford a decent week long solo trip.
I've struggled with depressive episodes on and off for a good chunk of my life, and desperately want some inspiring and grounding time to really connect to myself and life.

Here's the problem...
1. I am scared I guess?
2. No idea what is considered safe
3. No idea what is affordable (while still safe)
4. I'm not a hugely social person

I know I probably sound silly with these dilemmas, but I'd appreciate *any* tips.

**Places I've debated**
- Small little towns in the middle of Switzerland
- Norway
- Ireland (I have Irish ancestry so I feel like this could be cool?)
- Sweden
- British Columbia in Canada

These are just ideas, I'm really just in need of a nature filled break!

I used find my on my friend's phone immediately after I noticed it was gone within the span of minutes, but it keeps showing as “Location not found”, which means whoever had it shut it off instantly after they took it. I never lost any personal items clubbing or travelling in general, so this incident was especially unusual when I regularly check my pockets and safekeep items.

I’ve already notified the club and filed a report with the police.

Long time lurker but never posted. I’m 22M doing one of my first solo travels this weekend to Germany - have travelled in the US alone but first time in Europe. I’ve been going around Spain for a few months now but mostly in groups. Before I return to the USA for holiday season, I’ll be traveling from the 13th - 23rd of December. I wanted to get thoughts on my itinerary, which I built based off solo travel feedback here, where flights are relatively the cheapest and within budget as well as some acclaimed Christmas markets I’ve seen when reading online.

1. Krakow 13-16. Have heard great things and also would plan to do a day trip to Auschwitz, something I’ve wanted to see for a while. 

2. Prague 16-19. Heard this is a good place to be solo and that the Christmas market is quite nice here. Additionally have had some friends personally recommend it before. Not a ton of knowledge but curious on thoughts.

3. Budapest 19-22. Everything I’ve read almost makes this out to be the holy grail of solo travel. From sites to see and bath houses for relaxation, it seems like a great spot.

I have to return to Spain where I am now to pick up some luggage on the 22nd before returning to the USA on the 23rd. Really open to any suggestions / thoughts on the above - I know most of you would likely go to 1-2 places max in this time span, but I’m not too sure when I’ll return to Europe so I’m trying to see as much as possible. Again, open to thoughts on that too. Really love this community and thank you all for constantly sharing your experiences!

Looking forward to the feedback : )",2024-11-07 03:10:09

And I have always thought I would be able to have my own life changing, reflective, world view altering experience someday. 

Ok, so back to reality, I know it's not going to be like that. I'm not going to discover a secret civilisation or feast on the flesh of a freshly downed wild antelope  but nonetheless I can't shake the feeling that it will still be life changing. At 40 I feel like I would love to finally fulfil my dream. I feel like I would love to at least try a more 'raw' experience, maybe backpacking and walking and really getting the feel of the country I'm in rather than staying in a more insulated hotel or running with a tour group. I don't want to party and I don't even necessarily need to make friends. I'd love to walk the streets, sample the street food, interact with the locals, sleep rough if necessary. I could get fit, quit smoking, absorb some different cultures, lose some weight. Thankfully I have enough money to completely throw this plan out the window and nestle into some cushy foreign hotel or even fly right home if all this proves too much for me but maybe.... Just maybe, this could be an experience of a lifetime. 

Any over 35's/40's that could weigh in on what it's like to travel, especially if it was your first time. Was it scary? Is it as life changing as I feel it might be? Was it actually really anti climactic and bothersome? ",2024-11-06 22:22:34
solotravel,1gkv0ry,"A good experience in Fes, Morocco!",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gkv0ry/a_good_experience_in_fes_morocco/,6,"I’m doing my first solo travel trip through Morocco. Many of the stories here seem to be negative so I wanted to add a positive story to counter the weight :) 

I was scheduled to arrive off the train at Fes close to midnight, and I was a bit anxious because some commenters here, plus some Moroccan mates said Fes can be a bit sketchy at night.

I get off the train, and being an obvious tourist I’m greeted by the usual chaos of being hassled by taxis and shop owners. It’s late and I’m tired, so I haggle with one of the taxi blokes and get a ride to my hostel.

About 75% through the drive he says abruptly that we’re arrived. We hadn’t, but whatever, close enough.

I jump out, check all my pockets to make sure I have everything, and realise to my horror that I don’t. Id been filling a form in the cab and left my passport in the back seat.

This was a pretty crap event, and in a mix of stupidity and hope I walked to a nearby taxi rank and started getting accosted by 10 cabbies wanting my business. 

I translated that I had left my passport in the back of a cab, and they immediately got super kind, making calls, driving around and talking to other cabbies, and within an hour they had found the exact bloke who took me for a ride, and my passport.  I was shocked. Some of them drove to other cab hotspots to chat with the other drivers.

I’m not sure how they worked so fast, there is thousands of cabs in this city, but the experience has really left a positive view of the city on me. 

I’ve been dealing with constant haggling and aggressive selling every day here and was getting fatigued from it, but it was incredible seeing how beneath the exterior even the most haggly group of taxis at 1am helped out. 

Obligatory note, I caused this myself because I was silly and didn’t check my stuff before getting out. I was extra silly for getting on a train that got in so late. I’ll be doing things differently next time! I’m also aware that in cities bad things do happen. But that said, it was humbling seeing a group of people really exceed your expectations and help out. I’m very grateful

Easter Island - 7 days - I'll be there for some of the Tapati festival, super exciting!

Christchurch, NZ - 30 days(?) - Staying with friends.

I haven't done much traveling. But I'm in my mid late 30s so no partying for me. I don't have much time to research as I normally would since I work 50 hours a week as a nurse in Canada. So I'm desperate for help.

After some researching I've done, this is what I've got. I'm looking for input to see if I should change something. I don't like to jampack my day as I like to see new things/food but also be relaxed.

* Day 1 Friday
   * Arrive JFK Airport at 7am 
   * Hotel at Midtown (drop off carry-on)
   * Times Square **(my must see)**
      * Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch
      * I was thinking visit in AM first before seeing at evening?
   * Central Park **(my must see)**
   * The Met Museum
      * Maybe do this on Day 2?
   * Saint Patrick’s Cathedral **(my must see)**
   * Rockefeller Center
* Day 2 Saturday
   * Grand Central Station **(my must see)**
   * Empire State Building **(my must see)**
   * Chinatown or Korean Town
   * Union Square
      * Buy used book here? Wherever I travel, I like to buy a used book
   * **Broadway at 8pm** (tickets bought)
* Day 3 Sunday
   * **I bought tickets to watch the Giants game at 1pm. Does this day look right or should I be doing something else?** 
   * Financial Distsrict
   * 9/11 Memorial
   * Statue of Liberty **(my must see)**
      * Going up is a must for me. Anything I should know about?
   * Evening
      * Bar? Comedy show? Broadway show?
      * I’d like to see a dubstep show (lol). But tbh, I’d be fine not going. Considering I am going to a Broadway show already at 8pm and I’d rather sleep after Lol. I’m in my 30s.
* Day 4 Monday
   * Brooklyn Bridge **(my must see)**
   * West Village
      * Buy slice of pizza here somewhere as per my friend
   * Chelsea Market

There's a few places I haven't included as I am not sure which day to see it. I know I want to see the Rockefeller Building too but I presume that's a ""go and see and leave in 10 minutes"" or am I wrong?

\- Food is important. I want good food but reasonable budget. Maybe one meal a day where I'll splurge $20-40 USD and the rest of the meals for that day is light snacks (ie. pizza, bagel, etc).   
\- My must sees is what I plan to see on a particular day. And the rest I'd be fine not seeing/doing if I decide day of I don't want to or I'd rather do something else.  
\- I'm staying in Midtown  
\- I'm fine walking. If it's going to take me 20 minutes to walk, I don't mind. Especially if taking the bus takes 30. I walk pretty fast. With that said.. I also don't mind paying a premium for Uber for I presume in NYC, the traffic will kill me?  
\- I'm open to paying to go up Statue of Liberty. And paying for things as I probably won't be back to NYC for a while.

I’ll either rent an Airbnb or stay in a hostel, so recommendations for areas that offer affordable accommodation would be super helpful too. Any hidden gems or lesser-known beaches worth checking out?

If anyone has specific recommendations within Tokyo such as specific restaurants bars, or nightlife that would be great as well. I will be 20 when I go and want to engage with locals around my age. I anyone has any broad suggestions for hotels or anything like that as well would be appreciated.

solotravel,1gklmlc,First time solo traveller who's bitten off more than they chew,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gklmlc/first_time_solo_traveller_whos_bitten_off_more/,13,"Hi everyone, as mentioned in title this is my first ever solo travel internationally and I have come to realise solo travel abroad vs in your own country are far more different than I had expected. I knew it would be a challenge but this is overwhelming and looking for advise.

For some context, I'm a kiwi male with inattentive ADHD who lives rural, work outside and never been much of a city person. I have always had my own vehicle to get around and do small camping or hiking trips down the line (2 - 5 days generally with a mate or two sometimes solo for 3 days.) And ive wanted to go to Japan for nearly 8 years now as I had always admired the culture as a whole, from the historical to the futuristic aspects. So I had finally gotten the time money and courage to bite the bullet and book the trip. My original plan was 35 days, going as far south as hiroshima and as far north to sapporo. 

However, it is currently my 6th day in japan, after spending 4 nights in tokyo, and traveled to fujiyoshida for one night. I have realized I had underestimated almost every aspect of the trip, Especially the joys of using public transport and having to learn about all aspect of public transport especially in a foreign language and country and learning how to use them and missing stops, stressing and worrying about how to get to the next location, and realizing I'm barely doing half the things I originally had planned each day. 

I have areas where for 2 nights in a row I'll be traveling and staying in a new city for only one night each. For most of my entire trip I am staying only 2 - 3 nights before doing multi one night stays to travel very far distances. I have realized I have NOT planned this well as my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I'm finding myself stressing most of the day, worrying about what to do next and learning how to get from point a to b to visit all my locations in time. 

Its doesnt help that i overanalyse things and adhd im not great with time scheduling and handling when things go far off course than I had planned for the day, so far i am just rolling with the blows but I'm not sure if I can handle another 4 weeks of this. I wish i could attach my high tech visual aid map (screenshot of Google maps with MS paint drawing lines) of each location i had planned to stay at and for how many nights
But I can also post my location and days too if needed.

Tldr I'm struggling handling first time solo international travel and actually enjoying my time. Any advice especially from any other adhd solo travellers and should I rebook some of my later locations so I travel less to instead stay at fewer locations but for longer to be less stressed? 

Thank you in advance for any replies.

I'm planning a 14-day road trip in December, starting from Vancouver, B.C., and passing through San Francisco and Los Angeles on my way to Las Vegas. This will be my first time driving this route, and I'd love some advice on the best itinerary, routes, and recommendations for stopovers.

Here's a bit more detail:

* **Timeline:** I have two weeks total for the trip, so I'd like to get an idea of how long I should spend in each city and any recommended stops along the way. For reference, I plan to be back in Vancouver on the 14th day.
* **Route:** I'm considering driving down the Pacific Coast Highway for the scenic views, but I'm open to suggestions, especially if weather conditions in December make specific routes more challenging.
* **Points of Interest:** I want to visit some key attractions in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, but I am also interested in any hidden gems or smaller towns worth visiting along the way (the itinerary is very flexible). I'd also like some recommendations/tourist attractions for these bigger cities!

My main questions:

1. **How should I split up my time?** I want to maximize my time in the main cities (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Diego) but still have a few days for rest stops and sightseeing.
2. **Route suggestions:** Should I stick to the Pacific Coast Highway, or are there alternative routes that offer a balance of scenery and ease of travel in winter? As mentioned, this will be my first time travelling within the U.S., and I'd like to avoid driving in the snow as much as possible. Unless I'm missing something, I think the Pacific Coast Highway might be ""safer"" (non-snowy) than the I-5 during December?
3. **Weather concerns:** How likely will I run into difficult road conditions in December, especially along the coast? Are there specific areas I should avoid or plan for differently due to winter conditions?

Thanks so much for any tips and advice!",2024-11-05 23:48:35

solotravel,1gjappi,There is value in sticking it out,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gjappi/there_is_value_in_sticking_it_out/,32,"So many posts on here of people feeling lonely, anxious, nervous, awkward, scared and wanting to come home etc. I am not trying in any way to diminish anyone’s experience in the following post. I have been there, I know. I also realise that many if not most people just love being truly solo which is great. 

What I’m trying to get at I guess is the concept of adaptation. Adaptation never happened without struggle and discomfort. If you truly want to improve your confidence, composure under pressure, self image etc you need to experience PRESSURE. That means being rejected by people in hostels, staying home when everyone else is going out. missing flights, meeting deadlines, performing under pressure in scary / dangerous environments with no shoulder to cry on.

I feel like people fail to realise that though these experiences objectively suck, they are training you for real life. If you are anxious, overwhelmed, lack resilience in your everyday life (as I definitely did) solo travel will most likely suck for you initially, but diamonds are forged under pressure and when you stick out those hardships and return home, you will feel like a new person, there’s no way you can’t. Your brain has adapted to a new more demanding environment, and that is now your baseline.

As others have said on this sub, I’m not saying you will be cured. In my subjective experience I was however I realise that won’t be the situation for everybody and obviously I don’t endorse travelling with severe and debilitating forms of anxiety and other severe mental health problems.

 But if this reaches anyone who is thinking of calling it quits because “it’s too hard” or you’re feeling at your lowest all I can say is that is very likely growing pains. 

Would love to hear everybody’s thoughts on this reasoning - ultra experienced and solo travel newbies. ",2024-11-04 09:57:01
solotravel,1gjc8az,Trip Report: Ukraine in 2024,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gjc8az/trip_report_ukraine_in_2024/,162,"I hesitated quite some time to write about my Trip in Detail public but I guess half a year later it's time for it. There has been a Trip Report from someone else about [visiting Ukraine in 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/13ielov/trip_report_ukraine_in_2023/) which inspired me to also write about my experience this year. Iam Male 25 from Germany. I took the Trip in early May this year.

**Considerations pre Trip**  
I have been interested in off the beaten Track Destinations basically ever since it was possible for me to travel. I was last year in Norther Cyprus and Lebanon, so I had some limited experience with Solo traveling in non-Mainstream Locations. I was interested in visiting Ukraine for multiple years already, but first COVID put a hold on my Plans and then in 2022 the beginning of the Invasion. 2 years after that I was still interested and put many hours into researching if and how visiting Ukraine is possible and what are the risks that come with it. In the end, I can't and won't encourage anyone to go there. I took very careful considerations and came to the conclusion that I am willing to take a Trip not further east than Kyiv and Maximum 1 Week, no longer. Influential was surely also that I know someone living in Kyiv I was able to get some up-to-date information on how the situation is on the ground, and that I basically put so much time effort into researching, I could at one point not bail out and don't do it anymore, I was too deep into it.

**Planning the Trip**  
From all the research I did, I had a very good idea of how to do it. I then booked a Flight to Hungary, from where I was about to start the Rail Journey east. Hungarian MAV Rail 2nd Class to Zahony which is close to the Border to Ukraine and then a Border Train to a Town in Ukraine called Chop where immigration into Ukraine will happen. From there 1h Train to Mukachevo where I had booked a Hotel for a Night. Then on the next Day, 14.5 Hours Overnight Sleeper Train 1st Class to Kyiv. I booked a Hotel in Kyiv for 4 Nights, good Location in Downtown Kiev including breakfast. I left Kyiv on a 10,5h IC Train to Przemyśl in Poland, which was connecting onto an 8,5h Overnight Sleeper Train of Regiojet to Prague. From there, Eurocity Train to Regensburg, which is the rough Region where I live. I was able to get a Ukrainian E-Sim from a Friend of mine which was a great help, I had basically unlimited Internet from the Moment of crossing the Border. I took around 350 Euros in Cash with me, even tho Creditcards are widely accepted in Ukraine, better safe than sorry. I took only the bare minimum of Stuff with me in my Carry on, no Laptop, No Camera only phone and clothes basically.

**Getting into Ukraine**  
My Trip started from Munich Airport, from where I took a Flight to Hungary. I had booked a Hotel close to the Train station in Budapest, my Train was departing the next Day. The Night was rather rough as I thought a lot about what I was about to be doing. I had only told a handful of Friends/Family Members about my Plans, not even my Mother (she would have been too scared unnecessarily). On the next Morning there was no return, I went onto the first train of many more to come and went east. During the ride, I started a conversation in broken English with a Ukrainian woman going back into Ukraine. She asked me why I was going into Ukraine and then just answered, ""We have Millions of Men in your Age wanting to leave Ukraine, but they can't, and you are entering just casually?"". That made me think of what I am doing here, truly. The first time during this Trip I considered abandoning my Plans, after some Hours I arrived at Zahony, where everyone has to disembark and then reenter the Train with a Passport Control of Hungarian Officers before. I had left the EU and was about to enter Ukraine. The Train started moving and after a Couple of hundred meters it drives on a Bridge above a River, which is the Border between Hungary and Ukraine and at the same time means a Time Difference of +1 Hour. My first time Zone Land crossing. The Station of Chop is not far after the Border and quite a contrast to the Hungarian Station a few Kilometers away. Now, the part I was scared the most of was about to come: Immigration into Ukraine. Obviously I had my full Travel Plans with me printed out on paper, the Details of my Friend I was about to meet in Kyiv plus an explanation why I want to go into Ukraine based on that. Given the Situation and Stories I read online, I was nervous, but in the end, everything worked well. I was not asked a single Question during Passport Control and only a couple of Questions regarding my Carry on Goods (Cigarettes, Alcohol and Money in Cash) in Ukrainian during Customs Check I had to translate with Google Translate to know what they mean. I think I was not asked more questions, as no one there was able or wanted to speak English. Chop is a rather small crossing, I don't think many foreigners come through there. That was it, I was in Ukraine, a surreal feeling that remains till today. On that Day I had no more for this report interesting Memories. In the evening while walking through Downtown Mukachevo I saw the first signs of war: Pictures of fallen soldiers from the regions which were displayed on the Town Square.  
I have to add that since I boarded that Train in Zahony I was often looked at very strangely by Ukrainians, must have been for many quite interesting to see a non-Ukrainian 25-year-old Male heading into Ukraine, I bet some thought I am going to fight on the front. These stares and looks continued through my whole trip, reaching its peak on the Train leaving Ukraine.

**The long Journey to Kyiv**  
As my Train to Kiev was not about to leave until 5 PM, I had the possibility to visit [Kosino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VW8yJ1mfBx4nyd4U8), which is a very famous Thermal Spring Bath in Ukraine. I was told before the war it was packed all day, when I was there tho, it was not super busy, even tho it was orthodox Easter holidays. As Germans are usually like, I was way too early on the Platform of Mukachevo Train Station waiting for my Train. Before my Train arrived, there was another Sleeper Train also going east to a City I guess the world by now knows well about: Zaporizhzhia. Many Soldiers in Uniform were waiting together with their Wives and Children for that train. They embarked, said goodbye to their Family and went into war. Some if not many of the soldiers saw them for the last time there. When I realized what I am actually seeing, when I realized fully that there is a brutal war going on in the east, I was really considering for the 2nd time during this Trip if I should stay in Mukachevo for an additional Night and then go back into Hungary the next Day. Don't get me wrong here, I obviously was aware of the War and all the Situation in Ukraine, but seeing Men giving farewell to their Families before going into War where some of them will eventually die, that hit me different.  
My Train then eventually came, I embarked, got into my 1st class cabin and there I was, Solo on the longest Train Journey of my life so far towards Kyiv. I sat on the Window for a couple of hours, admiring the absolute beautiful Scenery of the Carpathian Mountains. As I read afterward, I had taken there one of the most beautiful Trainroutes in the whole of Ukraine. After we Stopped in Lviv at around 1030PM, I tried to get some sleep, which I did succeed in after some time despite the constant movement and Noise in the Train. I had the luck of staying alone in the Cabin for the whole night, so I woke up well rested the next morning on the outskirts of Kyiv.

**Kyiv, the Capital**  
Kyiv Train Station is quite straight forward. I got myself a very cheap Uber to my Hotel, checked in and then went towards Maidan by Metro. The Kyiv Metro is an absolute masterpiece of soviet Infrastructure. A single Journey is as cheap as 19 Cents. Disembarking at Maidan and actually standing on the Square where 10 years ago the Maidan Protests were taking place which more or less lead towards the current situation, felt surreal and looking at the pictures still feels today. In new cities, I like to research some famous sight I want to see, but also just walk and see where I end up from time to time. That's how I spend my first Day in Kyiv. I went from Maidan to [Mykhailivska ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27JHfgk9UwRmh3dQ9)Square, where some completely destroyed Russian Military Vehicles and Tanks are displayed to remember the Attack on the City 2 years earlier. Walking by the nearly endless wall of Fallen Soldiers since 2014 there made me realize how long this brutal War had been going before the Invasion of 2022. Seeing these was another step of realization of what actually is going on in the country. This process would reach its peak later that Day. After a good but rather late Lunch, I went to the [Glass Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bf4iMrMh2dg2h34o7) and enjoyed the View. Later that evening, I found out that this Bridge was bombed by the Russians some month prior, but it did not collapse. On my Way back to the Hotel, I walked to Maidan to get into the Metro from there. On Maidan however, was a large group of Soldiers and other People gathered around the [Independence Monument](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DsvwX9M9MxYaVdHg6). Coming closer, I realized that this was actually a funeral for a fallen Ukrainian Soldier. I carefully approached and joined the crowd rather towards the Edge for over an hour. I could not understand anything but what i saw was unlike anything i have ever experienced. Seeing the Mother of the fallen Soldier doing her speach under Tears was heartbreaking and deeply moving. What i guess was the Grandmother of the Soldier tried to make a speech aswell but she was unable to to do so and nearly collapsed while trying. Thats the final stage of my realization of how brutal War is and in which Situation this Country is in right now.  It was the 3rd time i considered aborting on the Spot and getting into Poland asap. Getting sorted mentally was not easy that evening as also on TV the majority of the Program is about War.

**Preparations for the Night**  
During the phase of the war when i took the Trip, the Russians mostly did fire Rockets and Drones going deep into the country only during the Night, which is why I was expecting an Attack each night. I had at all  Time a Backpack with me which had my Passport, a Powerbank, 1,5L Water and some Snacks in it. This would serve me in case I had to go into a Bunker for some Hours. This backpack was always ready to grab when I was in my Hotel Room. During my Trip, i closely monitored the situation in the Country via an App and the Telegram Channel of the Ukrainian Airforce. In case of an Alarm, they broadcast whats the reason for it there. The first and Second Night was uneventful. 

**Museums and bad Weather**  
During all my Trip so far the Weather has been amazing. 20-23° and no Clouds. That changed a bit on Day 2 in Kyiv as i was greeted by some Drizzle. I continued to explore Maidan a little more and then went to the [National Military History Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bk2hdgcQGo6UeQ6w6) which was a very Interesting experience. Right after entering the Museum i was finding an abandoned Ticket Desk. After some time a Guard came but he did not speak English. After another couple of Minutes a Women from the Office came and explained me in nearly perfect English that i have to buy the Ticket Online. I did so, showed the confirmation to her and was allowed entry. As there are simply no Tourists in Kyiv because of the War, i was the only visitor of the Museum and had no rush to explore everything in depth. The majority of the Museum was themed about the current War. They had many Items since the 2022 Invation on display like used Launchers donated by Western Countries. They had aswell Multiple Drones on Display including Bayraktar TB2. I could go on basically forever what they had on Display as iam interested in this Topic, but that would not serve the purpose of this Trip Report. For some exhibition Rooms i had a Guard comming with me to unlock it and enable Power which was very kind of them. Overal i can highly recommend that museum. I had spent close to 5 Hours in it so it was time to grab a Coffee in a nearby Park, relax a bit and then heading back to the Hotel to get some Lunch.

**Motherland Statue and Chernobyl Museum**  
The 3rd Day brought amazing Weather again so i went with a Bus towards the Motherland statue. On the way leading to it were many ex Soviet Tanks and other Military Vehicles on Display where i spend over an Hour looking at it. Comming closer to the Motherland Statue i noticed a ton of Black Mercedes and lots of Armed Soldiers and Police patroling the Area. That is nothing unusual as Kiev is crowded with Soldiers and Police with Guns patroling the Street. When i came closer they told me to go which i surely did. Later that Day i found out Zelenskyy had given a speech just below the Statue which is why it was locked by Security Forces. After another Uber Ride i was in Podil which features a nice Ferris Weel and the Chernobyl Museum. I spend around 2 Hours in the Museum but i did not really like the Experience there. Because of many School Classes it was crowded and very little information in English. I got someting to eat and rode the ferris wheel which was an interesting experience. I made my way on foot up towards the [St. Andrew's Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7FVS5QMTmA2yZVqj7). On the street many Street vendors have their booths set up so i was shopping some Souvenirs for Family and Friends and had some good conversations with the sellers abot their current Situation and the Situation of Ukraine. On the Evening i met up with my Friend living in Kiev and we went somewhere to eat dinner. 

**Turbulent last Night**  
My last Night in Ukraine was unlike the ones before. At around 4 AM the Air Raid sirens went of, Russia had launched another Attack on the Ukrainian Energy Infrastructure. The Attack was going for around 3 Hours and multiple explosions were heard over Kyiv as the Air Defense shot down approaching Rockets and Drones. I had an App Installed on my Phone which would give me an Alarm in Addition to the Sirens outside. It was working fine when i was still at home. One thing i did not think of tho was that if Quiet Mode is enabled, that Alarm wont go off on my Phone. Because of an Enabled Quiet Mode i basically slept through all the Attack and was only waken up by some Sirens at around 0630AM the next Morning. By the time i realized what is going on the Attack was already over. As my Hotel did not have a Bunker and my Room was not on the Top floor, i decided to stay in my Room anyways should at Attack during the night occur as it would be safer than going out towards the nearest Bunker. Most Ukrainians do so too btw.

**The long Journey Home**  
After reading the News and some Messages from Friends reading about the Attack in German News, i headed with an Uber to the Train Station. To enter the Station its required to go through a Security Screening like at an Airport. I went after some waiting to my Train to go back to Poland. The Journey was supposed to take 10 Hours. On the Track i was again starred at very strangely by locals. Most Passengers on that Train were Women with Toddlers or Babies, Seniors above 65 Years old and a handfull of Foreigners. I met 4 men from the US/Canada who where on the Front fighting. Out of respect i of course did not ask any questions about that, tho i have deep respect of them. After around 2 Hours another Air Raid Alert was going off. The Trains continue driving regardless of any Alarms. In Lviv Border Guards, some with AK74s, board the Train and check for Documents, another period of tension for me. In the End everything worked out for me. I was not asked any Questions even tho these Border Guards spoke good English. My Bags werent checked aswell. Some Ukrainians had to disembark at an unofficial Stop right before the Border which took over 2 Hours. It was sad to see these sometimes young men not being allowed the leave the country while i had no Problems at all. I realized the streng of the German Passport in that Moment and was glad to have one.  
With a 2 Hour Delay we entered Przemysl. The Waiting time for the EU Entry took quite some time aswell so i was exhausted when boarding my Regiojet Sleeper Train to Prague. I made my Bed and fell asleep basically immediately.  
I woke up shortly before reaching Prague from where i continued to Regensburg on the same Day. Disembarking at my local Station knowing i made the Journey from Kyiv all the way home by Rail only was an overwhelming feeling.

**Home!**  
What can i say now afterwards? Was it worth it? For me personally yes. I was able to get impressions from a country in a very special Situation which is also great stuff to tell people about. Ukraine is not just War and destruction as it might sometimes seem like while watching the news. I was feeling safe during my whole trip. Going nowadays into Ukraine requires a deep personal consideration of risk vs. benefit. ""Safe"" is considered by each individually. For me Kyiv was ""Safe"" when i visited, i would have never taken the trip otherwise! I dont want to encourage anyone to do the same and travel to Ukraine currently. Its a very special type of travelling, especially solo like me.  
Would you have visited Tel Aviv 2 years ago before the recent agressions? If yes the Situation in Kiev in May was not very different: A Lot of Air Defense (""Iron Dome"") around to city which will shoot down most approaching Rockets and Drones before they Impact.   
**Please do your own research!**

I'm headed to Santiago end of the month and the plan was to spend a few days there then go to Atacama; however when I started planning it out it's exceeding my budget by a lot.  So - I'm thinking of having a base in Santiago.

Day 1 - Get in early, relax, and then walk around, maybe go up San Cristobal or Sky Costanera

Day 2 - Walking / biking tour of the city and check out the other barrios

Day 3 - Tour to Cajon Del Maipo

Day 4 - Tour to Valparaiso / Vin Del Mar <-- should I spend a night in Vina?

Day 5 - Wineries (any you recommend; seems like Casablanca is better than Maipo?)

Day 6  - Inca Lagoon

Day 7 - Maybe another Vineyard?

I won't be renting a car so mostly relying on tours / uber / public transport around the city.

Also it'll be my birthday when I'm there - if you have any places I need to go to celebrate alone (haha) I would appreciate any recommendations as well.",2024-11-05 05:56:00

Or even ask for my itinerary straight up. Like dang bro, you did no research? I don't have each day planned out to the max (unless it requires a booking in advance, like the Vatican or something), but I have a list of things I want to do. So when I arrive somewhere I just pick off the list or area I want to see a day or two before.  I definitely let them down easy, but people are people and get butt hurt which is whatever. Of course there are exceptions: If we're both going to the same next city, sure let's go together, split the fare and eat somewhere. If I've actually gotten to know you over a few days. If we happen to book the same day tour. You have an idea of wanting to do something and invite me, then I'm more likely to invite you somewhere.

I'm trying to understand the thought process of people who do no research and just tag along to anybody. Why? Doesn't that defeat the ""purpose"" of solo traveling a bit? I'm not saying you need to have a full blown detail itinerary, know the city like the back of your hand, and always be alone but do you think you bring enough value to the other person?

1. Do you even care enough to get to the know that person, or you just use them for their planning?
2. If you get turned down then do you just walk around aimlessly or stay inside?
3. Do you not know or care that it's annoying when you don't want to do anything?
4. Are you actually afraid of being alone?

It's just I'm annoyed of being the only person who did any research. I feel like a mother duck with her babies walking behind her when I'm also on vacation. I try to be open minded with people, but it never changes.

  
EDIT: All the moochers are here, no surprise. I can't dumb this down anymore. Also, no one has explained why they do it. Or what it does for them. If you're scared to travel alone then say so. ",2024-11-05 17:41:05
solotravel,1gj15bu,How do people afford longterm travel?,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gj15bu/how_do_people_afford_longterm_travel/,333,"I’ve lived in 4 different countries now, currently live in London. I moved here so I could work and travel Europe. London is expensive but I only speak English so didn’t think I could get a job in any other European country. I appreciate comfort and safety when I travel so tend to book hotels rather than hostels. I’m 34 so feel too old for the nightlife/party hostel scene anyway. 

I can only ever afford to go on trips for 1-2 weeks max before feeling the need to go back to work so my finances don’t suffer. When I hear people talk about traveling for 6+ months at a time I’m genuinely curious as to how they achieve this? Do they live in hostels the whole time? Work while they travel? Or rely on their life savings? Or have rich parents who just pay for everything for them?If they do work while on the road, don’t you need a visa for that? How do you have fun if you’re penny pinching the entire time?

I just spoke to a new girl at work who “decided to get a real job for a bit after spending the last 12 MONTHS travelling Europe.. like wtf?! The longest stint I’ve ever done in 1 go is a month in Southeast Asia, which everyone knows is much more affordable than Europe, but even that felt like a stretch. I want the “digital nomad” lifestyle so bad but I value financial stability too much to ever look into it seriously. I don’t understand how people make it work, especially with the ridiculously high cost of living these days. 

I would absolutely love to quit my corporate job and backpack Europe for an extended period but it feels so unsustainable?!

I am planning a solo trip to South America in January and need some help narrowing down my destinations. I only have just under a month and want to do as much as I can while not rushing too much- I have learned the quality over quantity lesson the hard way on previous trips. Ideally, I don't want to stay anywhere for less than 4 days. I also am trying to stay at/below $3000 including flights. I typically book dorm rooms in nicer hostels, like to try some good food spots, do some fun activities, and go out for some drinks. 

Right now I am fine tuning my itinerary and feel like I may need to cut out just one destination to make everything run a bit more smoothly. This is large in part due to the fact that flights in South America are not only expensive, but are often not offered between destinations and connecting flights end up making travel days that much longer and more tedious. 

I like places that are relatively easy to meet other travelers, aren't too touristy, have good food, nature, and a nice vibe overall. 

Here's a rough draft of my itinerary so far. For those of you who have travelled South America what do you feel like I could go without? 

Also- not really looking to add on any destinations. I appreciate suggestions but have done a good amount of research and have already been to Peru and other parts of Colombia and although loved them, want to visit places I haven't been yet! 

TLDR; is this too much for a month (leaning towards yes), and if so, which destination(s) should I eliminate? 

  
Santa Marta/Tayrona in Colombia- 4 days

Medellin- 4 days

Santiago- 2 days (before flight to Atacama) 

Atacama Desert-/Uyuni Salt Flats tour- 5 days

Buenos Aires- 4 days

Floripa Brazil- 5 days

I am around 30 so I may do some hostels but not all the time haha. Travelling solo. 

Any thoughts ?

- Arrive in Manaus, go to a lodge in the Amazon for 3 days (4-5D)
- Fly to Sao Luis, go to Lençóis Maranhenses for 3 days (4-5D) - is it worth going in November at all?
- Rio de Janeiro (3 days) - maybe go to Parati too?
- Atacama - see the desert and volcanos (6D)
- Santiago de Chile + Valparaíso (3D)
- Guatemala (2 weeks) - Antigua, Tikal (&Flores ?), Acatenango, Atitlán, Playa Blanca, Semuc Champey
- CDMX & day trips  (5-6D)
- Oaxaca & day trips (5-6D)
- Puerto Escondido / Mazunte (7-8D)

solotravel,1gj9xae,Advice needed: Winter break planning paralysis after two magical trips - Iceland again or somewhere new? (26F),1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gj9xae/advice_needed_winter_break_planning_paralysis/,3,"TL;DR: Remote FT worker/PT law student (26F) stuck on winter break plans after having my first two perfect solo trips (New Year's in Iceland Dec 2023, summer 2024 in Northern Italy) - they were both so incredible that I'm paralyzed about what to do next. London's my second home but close friends who used to host me there are coupled up/moving in with partners. Need something to look forward to during law school stress, but worried about trying to match the magic of those trips.

Hey r/solotravel!

I caught the travel bug during study abroad in Europe. Now I'm a remote executive assistant and law student. I usually do 2-3 week trips, mixing vacation days with remote work (US hours), which lets me explore during European mornings and work from different coffee shops each day. I love feeling like a local wherever I go.

Until recently, my trips were always anchored by visiting friends. Then my first two solo trips changed everything:

Current Situation:

* Last New Year's: First real solo trip to Iceland - absolutely magical. Started with 2 days solo exploring walkable Reykjavík (perfect hostel location), then did a 3-day small group tour covering South Coast and Golden Circle. Back to Reykjavík for NYE - incredible traditions (beach bonfires, citywide fireworks, perfect hotel view of celebrations from right by the famous church). The whole country felt like being in a snow globe. Still haven't done Blue Lagoon (closed due to volcano).
* This summer: Second solo adventure - breathtaking Italy trip (Cinque Terre, Rapallo to Portofino, Lake Garda, Dolomites).
* London has been my second home since my year studying abroad (went alone, built a whole life there). Been back 4 times since Dec 2022:
   * Know the city inside out - have a whole guide I share with friends, weirdly love TFL (when there aren't strikes)
   * Have my perfect routine - favorite gym, coffee spots, neighborhoods, activities Christmas season is pure magic (my phone wallpaper is still a pic of the regent street lights at sunset from last year) 
   * Used to stay with my close friend right on Brick Lane, which was perfect - she worked during the day while I'd go to gym, explore, then evenings we'd hang, make dinner plans, or I'd work remote in the flat at nights 
   * My close friend who used to host me has a new boyfriend/busy life, other friends are coupled up and moving in with partners 
   * First time needing to budget for accommodation 
   * I would love to move back some day, at least for a period of time

The Real Dilemma:

* My first two solo trips were absolutely perfect - hard to imagine matching that magic
* This is my only break until July - law school is brutal and I need something to look forward to
* Little sister (MVP dog sitter) starts college next fall - probably my last chance with the perfect care setup. My parents would let me leave my dog there/look after her in the future, but it wouldn't be the same as #1 auntie
* First time truly planning without friend plans anchoring my destination - before, I always had friends eagerly waiting to host me or meet up (like last winter after Iceland, or having a friend to travel with before my Italy trip). Now it's completely my choice and that's making me second-guess everything. I'll probably still see friends, but it's not the same as having those solid plans pulling me somewhere specific
* It's November and I've been too swamped to plan with work and school -  although, last year I did plan in November and was SO excited about the idea of Iceland, my mom had been previously and told me where I should go. So that's another reason why I'm thinking of just redoing it - I really loved it so much
* Each year I have more responsibilities, and being in my second year of a four-year law program, I might need to prioritize legal internships after summer 2025. Want to travel and adventure while I still have this flexibility

Would love to hear from anyone who's:

* Returned to a place that was magical the first time (especially Iceland!)
* Navigated changing friend dynamics abroad while solo traveling
* Has winter destination suggestions (though Iceland is still winning)
* Felt stuck between recreating a perfect trip vs trying somewhere new - how did it turn out?",2024-11-04 08:54:15

Hoping to get some insight. I will be solo backpacking. Do you guys bring all your stuff (your big backpack) on the motor bike tour in Vietnam?

Or do you leave a bunch of it at hostel in Hanoi where you have a room or something? Or does the tour guide store your stuff?

This has been the case for my past two trips. I usually stay in hotels, so I miss out on meeting people like those who stay in hostels (it's just my personal preference). However, I'm finding it lonely now and wish I had someone to share these beautiful locations with. I see the beauty and culture, but it feels empty without someone to share it with.

On top of that, I have a lot to take care of, like applying for grad school, sending out applications, and searching for an apartment for my move back to the U.S. this December.

Now, I'm torn about whether to go on my next trip, as I've already bought a $200 ticket. However, it'll cost me another $500 or more for the hotel, activities, food, and travel. I'm trying to decide if it's better to just cancel the trip, save money & plan for the future.

solotravel,1giw2sa,Vietnam - Indonesia - Philippines // 2 months // where to go?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1giw2sa/vietnam_indonesia_philippines_2_months_where_to_go/,15,"I'm looking for some help from fellow travelers who have been to the places I have in mind.  
  
To sum up my likes/dislikes:  
\- I'm in my early 40s so not really interested in night life and beach clubs but more quiet places  
\- I like good food options but eat mostly vegetarian  
\- I love a nice beach and swimming  
\- snorkeling is cool but I do not do diving  
\- I like photogenic spots and views as I take my camera/drone everywhere  
\- some hiking is good but not my primary plan as I travel with only carry-on and as such don't have the space for clothes for colder heights  
\- not that much into wildlife, more for nature

I also do not have a motorbike licence so I have to use public transport/taxis/private drivers (which can add up quite fast so I'd like to avoid as much as possible)

1) Vietnam (end of February to either end of March or middle of April)  
  
After I finish my 3 month trip in Thailand I plan to stay 1 month in Da Nang (as an avid gym goer I'd like to stay put for the whole month since in the next 2 months it will be quite difficult to get my workouts done).  
  
I will do some 1 or 2 day trips to Hoi An and Hue.  
Any other suggestions to visit that are close to Da Nang?

After Da Nang I can either fly directly to Hanoi and spend a 2-3 days there exploring it before I fly to Indonesia.   
Or extend for another 7-10 days and explore some more with more time in Hanoi.

Places I have looked at are (staying 1-3 days in each):  
\- Phong Nha (2 nights) - maybe since it's on the way but not sure yet  
\- Ninh Binh (3 nights)  
\- Ha Long Bay or Lan Ha (looking mostly at 1 day tours from Hanoi)   
\- Hanoi (3-4 nights)  
  
Open to other suggestions.

2) Indonesia (2-3 weeks - starting either end of March or from middle of April)

I'm looking at Java and Sulawesi.  
I've been to Bali, Lombok, Gili islands and Nusa Lembongan this April so I'd like to explore other places

Deciding if it is better to take more time and stay only on Java for good 2 weeks or extend my Indonesia trip to 3 weeks and make it 10 days Java and 10 days Sulawesi

Rough itinerary for Java and Sulawesi;

  
Java:  
\- Jakarta (1-2 nights)  
\- train to Bandung (2-3 nights)  
\- train to Yogyakarta (3 nights)  
\- train Malang (3-4 nights) - want to explore Tumpuk Sewu waterfall and hike the Mount Bromo for the sunrise

Sulawesi:  
\- Makassan  
\- Leang Petta Kere  
\- Tanah Toraja  
\- Tentena  
\- Togian islands or Banggai islands (I might skip all of these since I'm off to Philippines for the beaches and swimming - what do you think)  
  
3) Philippines (good 2 weeks from beginning of May)

Land in Puerto Princesa

\- Puerto Princesa (1 night)  
\- Port Barton (2 nights) - relaxing beach time  
\- El Nido (2-3 nights) - relaxing and do one of the island hopping tours  
\- boat tour (3D2N probably) to Coron  
\- flight to Cebu  
\- Sumilon island (day trip)  
\- Siquijor (3-4 nights)  
\- Panglao island (2-3 nights)  


4) Vietnam  
I fly from Cebu to Ho Chi Minh (since I already have my return ticket from there) and explore for a couple of days before returning home.

So is this to optimistic/rushed?   
Anything skippable or worth adding?

Open to all suggestions :)

I 29 (F) planning a solo trip to Vietnam in December, staying for around six days. My current itinerary includes:

	•	Da Nang and Hoi An: 3 days split between the two locations
	•	Hanoi: 3 days exploring the city, with plans to visit Ninh Binh instead of the usual Halong Bay cruise.

I have some concerns about the weather, especially in Central Vietnam. Based on what I’ve researched, December tends to be quite rainy, with potential flooding in that region. Given my itinerary, which covers both Central and Northern Vietnam, I’m wondering if it’s wise to go ahead with my travel plans in December, or if I should consider moving my trip to another month with better weather conditions. I do not wish to travel to the southern part and as central / northern seems more exciting to me. :)

I’d love to hear any advice or recommendations from those familiar with Vietnam’s seasonal weather or who have traveled there in December.

Thank you so much for your insights :) ",2024-11-03 15:28:06

Im looking into the possibility of a 2 week CDMX trip to climb Nevado de Toluca, La Malinche, Ixta, and Pico (Ixta and Pico guided, the others as acclimatization peaks!) Unfortunately none of my friends are available and I’m figuring that unless I go solo, it may not happen. I did a month in Europe+ Istanbul and Nepal solo earlier this year, and all without cell phone service. Met up with various friends for brief parts in between but a good bit was just me. I’m not big into night life/partying but do enjoy being outside and engaging with local art and museum scenes/markets etc. 

I don’t know Spanish, but could hypothetically learn the basics before going. Has anyone done a mountaineering trip like this out of CDMX? There’s so much conflicting info online about safety/scams/women. Ideally for Nevado de Toluca and La Malinche it would be great to connect with people beforehand to do the public transport & hike with a companion. 

Any insights would be much appreciated!

Honduras: 10 days-2 weeks. I also want to dive here.

Nicaragua: 2 weeks. Volcano boarding is a must.

Costa Rica: 2 weeks.

Panama: 1 week.

Colombia: Possible add on if I have the funds.

Hi, I'm (22F) am in Bangkok for my first solo trip abroad. I had really been looking forward to this trip and had super high hopes but it seems that everything that could go wrong went wrong. I've also been feeling so overwhelmed by the crowd and the heat, and my anxiety from being alone didn't help either. 

Accidentally stained my clothes in the process, got an allergic reaction from eating seafood (that I normally don't get), etc. I also went to get a rush order made that now I'm not even sure will deliver on time for my flight back home after seeing a negative review that I missed out on during my initial research. Although the more I think of it, I could probably just forfeit the order and just lose out on the deposit.

I'm also not sure what to tell my family and friends when I get back home. Everyone always says that solo traveling is an enjoyable experience, but what do I say if my trip, for a bigger part, has been the opposite? 

Any advice (including tips for more chill activities) would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!

We got to chatting, and they told me they had a concert later that night (they are part of a 7 person band). 

I follow them to get beers, everything is great. But then suddenly one of the dudes starts HARD selling me on drugs. Like, 6 different types of drugs that they could get me. I took his WhatsApp contact info and acted interested, but told them “not right now, I need to speak to my friends later”. Well that was fine until like 5 minutes later when they returned to the topic. So I told them to sod off, paid for my beer and walked away without saying goodbye.

So I’m curious, what is everyone else’s experience with locals being “friendly”? Have you ever had a good/great experience that didn’t involve extracting your foreign money? Cheers!",2024-11-02 22:11:53

solotravel,1gic4br,Advice wanted: Silk road or SE Asia for a a big Solo Travel experience,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gic4br/advice_wanted_silk_road_or_se_asia_for_a_a_big/,20,"Howdy everyone, 

Looking for advice on which way to orient myself for a trip I'm planning to embark on next spring 2025. For context, I'm currently living in Japan and am a dual citizen with Japan and the US, but grew up mostly in the US. I've been solo traveling in, and now working in Japan since spring 2024. I've been thinking about my time so far in Japan akin to a Working holiday, and once the year wraps up and I have some more money saved up, I want to embark on a further journey in Asia. Aside from this past year in Japan, a country which I am familiar with and speak the language of, I've never done a big Solo Travel in completely foreign land. 


Which brings me to the two main routes I am torn between. China and the Silk Road overland to Europe if I'm able, or SE Asia, perhaps including some Pacific island nations like Taiwan and the PL and terminating in Singapore. 

I'd really like to use planes as little as possible. This is not a hard set rule, but I personally feel like planes feel a bit like ""cheating"", and prefer to travel by bus, rail, and sea. 

For budget, I have around $18k saved up, and I hope to buttress this some more with my yen earned here, but I may use that to fund my further travels within Japan. I am a pretty low cost traveler, being a young, single guy, but occasional business hotels and nice meals can be a nice change from hostels and cheap eats. 


Frankly, My heart is telling me China and the Silk Road. I've always wanted to explore China and Central Asia, and I find the history, geography, and mix of cultures to be fascinating. If I were to do this I would begin here in Osaka and cross via ship to Shanghai. I would cross China and plan on crossing via land to Kazakhstan via Xinjiang, and then working west from there. I understand the ferry across the Caspian is not available as of now, and overland via Iran though doable with my Japanese passport, seems high risk as a US citizen. From there, if I'm able I'd like to explore the caucases and then connect to Istanbul. That's incredibly ambitious for me, but I think theoretically feasible. However I understand it will be more challenging, and perhaps riskier than the alternative. 

The other main route I was thinking of is island hopping to Taiwan, Philippines, and then to mainland SE Asia and working my way overland through Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, Malaysia to Singapore. Maybe Indonesia too. This would nonetheless be an incredible journey, with more touristy infrastructure and ""sights to see"" perhaps. My family would be less worried about my safety here cause they have experience with SE Asia travel and find it less daunting. 


So I'm torn between these two main options. The overland Silk Road trip would comply with my no planes wish more, but would likely be far more challenging. In terms of language, I speak zero Chinese(maybe some kanji would translate), Russian, or Turkic language. English seems more widespread in SE Asia, which would be a bonus. I've only done cursory research on the visa requirements for the nations listed, but I think China may be the more strict on this front, but relatively easy as a tourist.


If anyone has experience with either of these, or would give any advice or give me a reality check on the logistics of either, it would be much appreciated. ",2024-11-03 01:42:10

I know that Contiki trips are known for partying etc which is one of the reasons I want to go but I was thinking that the nightlife might be quite quiet during the winter months.

solotravel,1gheso7,Morocco trip report for solo female,211,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gheso7/morocco_trip_report_for_solo_female/,106,"I don’t normally post about my trips because I’m part lazy/busy and part concerned about being recognised here but I feel like it might be helpful/interesting to other people so will post anyway. I might delete this later.

I just came back from a solo trip in Morocco. I’m an asian female from an English speaking country who can speak a tiny bit of very basic French. I am pretty comfortable solo travelling after spending most of this year doing it. I decided on Morocco because it seemed really different to my previous trips but I kept reading how dangerous it was for a solo female to go there so was extremely anxious and took every precaution possible to mitigate risks to myself. In the end, whilst some of the anxiety was helpful, I think some of it was a bit overdone.

My trip can be summarised as follows:
- 3N in Fes, including a private tour by a professional guide into the old Medina and a day trip to Chefchaouen. Flew into Fes because the flights were the cheapest.
- 3D/2N shared desert trip from Fes to Marrakesh booked online after reading extensive reviews.
- 1N in Marrakesh. I regret spending so little time here but it was due to anxiety after reading online about it.
- 2N in Rabat/Sale.

Thoughts:
- On the medinas: Fes medina is super hard to navigate and a (professional) guide would be important, but Fes itself is really interesting and I’m glad I went. Chefchaouen was quite touristy and good for photos, besides that I didn’t enjoy it that much. Marrakesh medina seemed pretty safe because it was full of people even late at night and the roads seemed easier to navigate than Fes, so a guide might not be necessary (keeping in mind I regretfully only spent one night there however). Sale medina was very authentic and a bit unsanitary and there were basically no tourists though it seemed safe enough to walk around alone since it was so crowded. Rabat Medina was more touristy and also more comfortable and clean.
- Regarding the desert trip: given I booked online I probably paid a fair bit more than people who booked in person but I found the quality of the tour very high and would be happy to recommend the company if anyone is interested. There were barely any sales pitches or pushing us to buy things, and lunches weren’t always at the very touristy spots I was expecting. I bought a scarf in advance as I read that it was needed for the desert and they would be pushy and over charge on the tour, but it wasn’t the case and in fact I could have bought it at the desert itself for a similar if not a cheaper price (perhaps slightly lower quality but it wouldn’t have mattered). Actually the scarf wasn’t particularly necessary in itself because there was barely any wind in the desert but it’s probably best to get one just in case it is windy another day. I didn’t choose the luxury option in order to save money and it didn’t seem to matter, as I heard the luxury option only really had a private bathroom but besides that sounded quite similar. The desert tour was by far the highlight of my entire time in Morocco, as I had an excellent tour group and I especially loved the quad biking experience at dawn. The guides at the Berber desert camp did a great job in making our experience enjoyable and were super friendly and fun, I was really impressed. 
- On Rabat/Sale: I found it kind of boring in comparison to the rest of the trip. I stayed in Sale thinking it was good to be close to the airport but actually staying in Rabat would have been better because Sale does not have much to do and seemed like a much poorer city compared to Rabat. Rabat itself seemed very safe and clean but not as exciting as the other cities.

In terms of any problems, the only issues that I faced were men randomly shouting at me when I walked past, usually in some Asian language, which I think is just part of their culture to do so as opposed to trying to be rude. I also had a lot of men randomly on the street talking to me to ask if I needed help, if I wanted them to accompany me, or one outright asked for my number. I mostly would either say no, thank you to them or ignore them/keep walking. Some men were very nice and would give me directions kindly then leave me be, one man in particular walked into the middle of the road to help me cross as there were a lot of cars and I was waiting for ages, then smiled and walked away. 

Whilst it’s definitely culturally a very different country to what I’m used to and men in particular can be really forward, I had no issues travelling there as a solo female but I think a lot of forward planning and caution significantly helped to make my trip comfortable and problem-free. I also dressed very conservatively. In hindsight I wish I didn’t feel so anxious leading up to it and could have enjoyed myself a bit more, but I also believe being cautious is still important to improve your chances of remaining safe. I’d love to hear other peoples’ experiences, whether it be good or bad, but I actually recommend Morocco as a solo travel destination. I really enjoyed it and overall found the people there really friendly and helpful.",2024-11-01 20:16:05
solotravel,1gi61r3,F41 Las Vegas June 2025,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gi61r3/f41_las_vegas_june_2025/,9,"Looking for some clarification on tipping. It's been 10 years since I was in the States solo. I'm talking taxi from airport, tips per drinks, meals, concierge, bell hop everything. I don't want to offend, I know it's part of the culture.

What confused me last time was I was supposed to write my tip on the bill, the bar/restaurant etc kept my card behind the bar. I prefer to tip in cash so I think on some occasions I tipped twice. I was writing my tip down and leaving it in cash, then my card was charged. Oops. If I only want to tip in cash, I do not want my card behind the bar - what is the preferred method? If my card is by the till, how do I pay my bill without writing on the bill and tip in cash?! This may seem very basic, sorry.

I just want to pay a tab and leave a cash tip. Is this acceptable? What about buffets? You pay upfront and leave money on the table when you're done?

I won't be hiring a car so I will be taking the odd taxi for certain things, what do you tip a taxi? The last time I was there I took the driver's number and called him whenever I needed him and I took him to lunch when I left as he didn't want to be tipped.

It seems so very nuanced? I don't want to offend.

Part of me also thinks I'm only there for a short while, why should I bother?

solotravel,1ghzfof,South America itinerary- Advice needed on working around rain season!,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ghzfof/south_america_itinerary_advice_needed_on_working/,5,"Hi everyone, I'm planning a 3-4 month trip starting late Nov/early Dec (this/next month) to South America + Central America and am a bit stuck on the order of the itinerary. The logical way would be to start in mexico and end in argentina, or the other way around, to minimize overland time. However, the rain season in peru and argentina are tripping me up.

I really want to do hikes, and I don't mind mist or drizzles but i HATE camping in rain or hiking with wet boots, so rain season and the salkantay/ macchu picchu overnight doesn't sound appetizing. Plan is, December- fly internationally from LAX (or NYC) into Argentina so as not to miss the summer season in El Chalten/ torres del paine. 

Problem is, by Jan, Peru, the next stop, will be in full rain season. I want to do hikes in the Cusco region, so this part I'm stuck on. If I thought about flying past Peru and heading flying back down from central america/ mexico at the end of my trip, but flights seem very long (no direct flights, 24h including layovers etc) and expensive (i'm seeing 700-1000 USD per one way flight) so it doesn't seem to make any sense that way. 

Any ideas on how to clever my way through this route?

solotravel,1ghi0m4,Solo travel to Uzbekistan,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ghi0m4/solo_travel_to_uzbekistan/,24,"Hi,

I'm 53yr and a very late-bloomer into this solo-travel thing. I've done a few short solo trips which I didn't count as really adventurous. I had my 1st real solo backpacking experience travelling around inland Turkiye for a whole month during the winter low season of December. It really changed my whole perspective in what is called a solo backpacking. Ever since I'm looking forward to my next solo adventure to Central Asia. Uzbekistan has always been in my bucket list ever since 2019 (before COVID ruin everyone's travel plan)

SO! back to Uzbekistan. I'm planning my 2nd solo backpacking in February next year for 2 weeks (options to extend a few days). I managed to read a few reports & updates from fellow solo travelers. I was thinking for starting from Tashkent (1N), then fly to Khiva (2N), Samarkand (2N), Bukhara (3N) & back to Tashkent. But most reports I see is the other way. 

Would appreciate any advice on the pros & cons of either directions, is it possible to stay a night in a yurt (mind you its wintertime in February). Which hostel (or any accommodation) best possible to meet other fellow solo travelers. 

Should I hire a guide in Khiva? For those who responded, thank you so much. :)",2024-11-01 22:42:25

I am a mid 30's guy. Planning a solo trip to the Philippines in Mid-November

I thought of doing Palawan->Siquijor->MoalBoal->El Nido but after talking to a friend I am considering doing Dumaguete instead of MoalBoal. 

I find the whole over-touristy part of MoalBoal canyoneering a bit difficult to swallow and prefer to take it easier in Dumaguete which is significantly less touristic and has its share of attractions. I also don't visit any actual city during the trip so I'm thinking Dumaguete is a pretty good option. 

I tried doing some research about it but with little success so why not ask this fine group. 

Is it recommended? The friend told me its a student city and I keep on reading how all the locals are so nice there and not trying to scam the living hell out of you. The debate I am trying to answer is whether its a better option than MoalBoal which I feel is a bit industrious and less suitable for solo traveling.

solotravel,1gh2avt,My First Solo-Travel Journey,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gh2avt/my_first_solotravel_journey/,12,"I (24M) have always travelled with friends or family. Thoughts about solo-travelling were always there, and one time, a few years ago, I almost did it - but ultimately decided I wouldn't have as much fun alone as I would with friends. Boy was I wrong.

Around a month ago, I embarked on my first solo-travel journey to Japan, for 22 days. I cannot stress this enough, but I had never been so happy and calm. It was the best month in my entire life, and I did not have a single negative moment. I had a lot of fears and was very anxious before my trip, but I'm happy to report that I literally cannot find a *single* disadvantage about travelling alone. 2 weeks in, someone from home asked me - ""How is it being all by yourself?"" - and then - it suddenly hit me, for the first time in 2 weeks - ""Oh god! I'm alone. I didn't even remember!"".

I had so many moments in my trip when I was very thankful to be alone, and I would like to share them, alongside other general benefits of solo travel, since I think they might be helpful to encourage someone, who's afraid to solo travel like I used to, to be brave and embark on a journey like mine.

1. **Time management**: I think the best thing about solo-travelling is the fact that you get to decide how to manage your time, and what is worth spending time on. There was a town that I really wanted to travel to from Tokyo, but it was pretty far away, and the only way I could enjoy it was to wake up at 5 AM and travel 3 hours each direction, having gone to sleep at midnight the night before. I didn't have a doubt that it was worth it - but all I could think to myself is that it would've been hell to convince someone else that it is. ""But we would barely have anytime to sleep!"", ""But 3 hours per direction is way too much travel!"", ""But that place is not even that nice!"". *Quiet.* It's so nice to just be able to make that decision in a matter of seconds. And by the way - it was the best day of my trip.

Time management is many things, really:  
\- The ability to stay at a place for a really long time without anyone hurrying you to move to the next place  
\- And on the contrary - not having to wait too long for someone who's spending too much time in a place where you don't think it's worth it  
\- Not having to deal with other people's random bathroom breaks or sleepiness throughout the day  
\- And on the contrary - having the ability to just go back to the hotel in the middle of the day if you feel sleepy or a bit under the weather

And the list goes on, really.

2. **Independency**: I hadn't known, but it was such a nice feeling to know that I could do everything by myself. Carry all the bags, talk to foreigners and locals, deal with bureaucracy and bookings, etc. It was really nice to be alone in my hotel room (something I don't get to experience ever, living with my family - by the way), wear whatever I want, listen to whatever music I want, not feeling rushed or hurried. 

3. **You're not actually alone**: Weirdly enough, I didn't really feel like I was alone, and the holiday felt very similar to ones I had with family or friends (minus all the bad things). You're surrounded by locals and tourists all the time, and nothing ever really feels like it's a duo or more exclusive. Look back at your past trips and think to yourself - how many of the great moments you had actually relied on another person being there? The landscapes, locals, attractions, food, history and culture - all of them are there for you to enjoy, whether you're alone or not. And I personally discovered that I actually enjoy them more when it's just the nature and me (or the city). Also, you could always send pictures and videos, and have a phone call or two with friends from home. That way you get to share those moments with them, just as you would if they were there with you.

4. **Budget**: It's not a secret that, in some ways, it's more expensive to travel alone - you don't share the accommodation's expenses with anyone else, you don't get to share a large meal with another person, etc. But what I discovered is that it's actually cheaper in some other ways. For example, you don't have to spend money on places or attractions you don't really want to go to (and with company, would otherwise compromise on). What's also nice, is that budget management with other people could be annoying or time consuming (how much you owe, or people owe you). It's so nice to have that out of the way.

5. **You're open to more opportunities**: When you're alone, it's much easier to approach you. At the same time, you have more reason to approach others, and socialize. If you're travelling with a friend or two, then most of the time (at least that's how my trips went on), you don't really socialize with others since you got your friends with your native language. Being alone in this trip made me more open and friendly as a person, and I met new people that I would've never met if I hadn't been by myself.

6. **Theme parks**: This one is a bit specific, but I decided to include it anyway. I really love theme parks, and I think they're really fun with friends - screaming on the roller coaster together, for example. So theme parks was one of the things that I was scared of the most, since I thought being there alone would take the fun out of it. But it most certainly did not! Having another person there, at least for me, is such a small part of it all, apparently. It's more about the ride itself, the way it makes you feel, the speed, the heights, the visuals. All of them are completely independent of another person being there! Also, **single rider lines!** So many attractions offer them, and you get to skip horribly long lines you would otherwise be part of.

I learned a lot of things about myself travelling alone, I went out of my comfort zone, became much more independent and much more friendly. I fell in love with solo-travel almost immediately and I'm afraid to say that now I'm addicted. There wasn't a single time when I felt lonely or bad that there wasn't anyone else that I knew there with me. For me, personally, it's only (well, mostly!) solo-travel from now on.",2024-11-01 10:33:30

Xin chào! I (23M) wanted to share my experience from my first solo trip. I spent 7 weeks in Vietnam and Laos.

*Budget*

**I budgeted $2500 USD and ended up spending $2700 USD.** I could have probably saved about $200-$300 if I had thought ahead a little bit more (booked a few flights last minute; would still do again due to the length of the trip but maybe could’ve booked earlier) and if I didn't make a few mistakes (I got got a few times, oh well)

My biggest categories for spending were Activities (which I include costs for things like museums, attractions, day trips, overnight trekking trips, etc.), Flights (which can certainly be avoided; I just gave up on buses), Shopping, and Food/Meals.

My daily budget was $50 USD and in the end I averaged $54 USD per day. I used the app TravelSpend which was SO helpful. I highly recommend.

*Trip Length*

7 weeks (Sept 11-Oct 30)

\~4 weeks in Vietnam, \~3 Weeks in Laos

*Destinations*

In Vietnam my route was: Ho Chi Minh City - Hoi An - Hue - Phong Nha - Ninh Binh - Hanoi - Cat Ba - Ha Giang Loop - Hanoi

In Laos my route was: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Luang Prabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

*Accommodation*

I used Hostel World the whole trip to book which was super easy. Granted I think I was there before the high season but I would book a bed only one or two days before arriving. Ceapest beds for dorm rooms were usually between $4 and $9 USD.

Vietnam Hostels (and Rating): **HCMC**: Saigon Rooftops Hostel (10/10); **Hoi An**: Mad Monkey (7/10), iHome Hoi An (9/10); **Hue**: New World Hotel (9.5/10); **Phong Nha**: Central Backpackers Hostel (10/10); **Ninh Binh**: The Banana Tree Hostel (9.5/10); **Hanoi**: The One Hostel (8/10), Hanoi Oldtown Nomad Hostel (6/10), Hanoi Central Backpackers (9/10); **Cat Ba**: The One Hostel (8/10); **Ha Giang Loop**: Mama's Homestay (9/10)

Laos Hostels (and Rating): **Luang Prabang**: Sunrise Riverside Pool Hostel (11/10); **Nong Khiaw**: DK-Camping and ATV Adventure (9/10) (I booked my homestay through Sabou, who manages this tour company and stayed in one of his bungalows); **Vang Vieng**: Chill House (8/10), Mad Monkey (8/10); **Vientiane**: Funky Monkey Hostel (2/10, avoid this place)

*Top Activities*

Ha Giang Loop (Ha Giang, Vietnam): Definitely a peak moment on this trip. I did 4 days, 3 nights with Mama's Homestay (around $200 USD) and had the time of my life. I had an easyrider (local driver) and saw some of the most breathtaking views I had ever seen before. It was like you turn a corner and see the most beautiful thing ever think that nothing can top it, then you turn the next corner and its even better. The food was amazing and the homestays throughout the trip were nice. The drivers are absolutely rockstars. They are so kind and welcoming and just totally enhance the trip. I also had a great group that I was placed with. The happy water stays flowing as well.

Paramotoring (Vang Vieng, Laos): Sunrise paramotoring ($100 USD) was not something I thought I would do on my trip but it was definitely a highlight. Soaring above Vang Vieng and the blanket of clouds so that the mountain tops just barely are peaking above. Insane views and such a cool experience.

Trekking in Nong Khiaw, Laos: I did a one day tour ($30) and a 2 day overnight tour ($40) here. Nong Khiaw is definitely an up and coming spot for eco-tourism. It feels like an authentic experience and you really get a good look at the rural parts of Laos. The one day tour was great and I got to see some rice fields, a water fall, a cave, a lookout point, and take a boat ride. The 2 day overnight was the highlight though. You hike up a mountain and arrive at the top as the sun is setting and get breathtaking views. Then you learn to make some Laotian food, sleep under the stars, and wake up to a beautiful sunrise. Highly recommend getting up to Nong Khiaw; about a 4 hour bus ride from Luang Prabang. I stayed at a homestay with the nicest family and learned lots about Laotian food and culture.

Day cruise (Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay, Vietnam): A day cruise ($25) that leaves from Cat Ba and shows you the beauty of Ha Long Bay. The insane rock formations and blue ass water make for stunning views everywhere. Swimming, kayaking, feeding monkeys, and soaking up the sun.

Hai Van Pass, Vietnam: I spent $15 to rent a scooter in Hoi An to drive to Hue via the Hai Van Pass. It was my first time ever driving a scooter and it was so fun! As you drive up and over the mountain you can make stops at these awesome coffee shops that overlook the pass and make for stunning views. After the mountain you can drive through some cool fishing villages and get a look at what Vietnam looks like outside of the tourist areas like Hoi An or Da Nang. Some parts of the highway were definitely not as fun when driving alongside semi-trucks, but this was still super worth it. Even if you don't drive yourself it is still a great ride (you can book an easyrider). The company I rented the scooter from gave me recommendations for places to stop and shuttled my big bag to Hue. I highly recommend renting a scooter at some point in your time in Vietnam!

*What Went Right*

* I met so many amazing people staying in hostels and going on tours. Even though this was a solo trip, I never really was alone. I even traveled with some people for 2-3 weeks! I made some life long friends :)
* I took it slow. I initially planned to only spend 2 weeks in Vietnam (which now sounds like crazy talk). I could have absolutely spent the whole 7 weeks there. I really learned to embrace the solo traveler/backpacker mindset of taking things slow, not planning too far in advance, and going with the flow. I ended up spending nearly 11 days in Luang Prabang. It can be so easy to get stuck somewhere and I would totally say to allow yourself to get stuck if you really connect with a place or people!
* I am pretty happy with my spending. Definitely could have cut some costs but to be honest I thought I was going to blow my budget by a lot more than $200 so I'll take it!
* Moved hostels if I felt like I needed a change or didn't like something at the current one. Only book for 1 or 2 nights at a time and extend if you want to (not sure if this works in the high season)

*What Went Wrong*

* Definitely got taken advantage of a few times. Always ask prices before you start anything (this includes taking taxis/tuk tuks/scooters, going on an impromptu tour, etc.) and don't be afraid to be stern or walk away.
* Weather was a barrier a few times. Didn't do much research beforehand on when I was arriving, which was near the end of the rainy season. Was confronted with Supertyphoon Yagi and a couple other storms.
* Wish I didn't fly as much. I flew from HCMC to Hoi An to make it in time for a full moon/harvest festival which I don't regret however I did skip Dalat which I want to go back to. Flew from Hanoi to Luang Prabang to avoid a 25 hour bus ride (if you have taken that ride I salute you, my body could not handle that). And flew from Vientiane to HCMC since I booked roundtrip to/from HCMC. Those flights are cheap-ish but they add up. I would try to avoid them.

*Recommendations*

My favorite stops were Hoi An, Phong Nha, Ha Giang, Luang Prabang, and Nong Khiaw. Highly recommend you really spend some time in Laos; many people told me you can do Laos in less than 2 weeks, which you can, but I think it is so worth spending some more time there (I didn't even scrape the south!).

I learned a lot through solo travel. It was such a positive experience overall but there are definitely difficult moments where you feel alone, homesick, tired, or just not 100% and that is okay. For me, the first week was a huge adjustment and I considered going home early so many times; try and stick it out. It is worth it. But also make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost.

Recommendations are just that! Everybody has different perspectives, mindsets, desires, goals, opinions...try to not get absorbed into other people's opinions on things and give everything a try! Ultimately, you'll have an experience that will be unique to you.

*Final Verdict:*

I feel like I've said a lot and there is so much more to say! I had such an amazing time in Vietnam and Laos and am counting down the days until I get to go back. The people in both those countries are so kind and welcoming. Their countries are full of rich culture and history, delicious food, and amazing experiences. Solo travel was such a life changing experience and I think everyone should try it at least once if they can! 

**If you're headed to either country I am happy to share more recs!**

Thank you, cảm ơn, ຂອບໃຈ! Safe travels, du lịch an toàn, ເດີນທາງປອດໄພ!",2024-10-31 21:00:47

In August I went to Thailand and Bali by myself and it was AMAZING. I met a girl in her early 20s who was spending 6 months traveling in Asia and planned on teaching English also. This was something I totally would have done at her age I just didn’t have the money. I am in school until next August 2025, but once I graduate I’d love to do the same. I’ll be 29 going on 30 by that time and I also feel like I really need to seriously start finding a partner if I want to have children someday. I’m in NYC and people here tend to settle down a little later but it’s also very tough here dating in your 30s. I just wish I had more time. I’ve been dating and who knows, maybe I’ll find that person by the time I graduate school and I’ll have my answer. I’m worried I’ll turn 35, 40 still single, and regretting I didn’t take this trip. Again I’m not sure if advice would work in this situation but if you are someone who feels similar or have been in a similar situation I’d appreciate some insight ❤️",2024-10-31 17:02:08

Since I am not a worker anymore in Australia, I can’t buy a travel insurance there and since I haven’t been a resident of Canada for 3 years, the companies said they can’t insure me.

I really speak only a few words of Portuguese and m Spanish is not conversational, so I feel really a bit out of place and intimidated. The hosts also didn't make an effort to welcome me (they did not introduced themselves or explained how everything works at the hostel). I stay in a private room, so I kind of hide in my room. I know I should just be relaxed and try to interact, but I feel just not comfortable and maybe not the one with the most self-confidence ( it is also the beginning of the trip).

I tried to reach out to other backpackers via the Hostelworld chat. Also tried to book a pub crawl, but it was cancelled.

I am a Solo- traveller, US citizen, studying in the UK and I often bounce back from London to Denmark because my partner is from here, and I am currently planning a Christmas trip this upcoming month. I use an app called Schengen Simple, and with a trip currently planned from November 13-18, it says I have eleven days after the 18th of November left in my allowance. Then it states that on the 16th of December, I have 68 days. I am planning on going to Denmark from December 11-December 31st to spend time with his family, but when I input that trip into the app, it changes the calculation backwards to zero days, over allowance. (Zero days before the 11th of December)

I am super confused by this, and was wondering if anyone could give any insight to why this may be, or if the app does a calculation method that doesn't seem to make sense. I know the rolling 90/180, and its hard to count back because I am coming and going for a few days at a time, and don't want to make any mistakes that will cost me coming here in the future. Though, this weird system with the upcoming trip is confusing me, despite it saying that my allowance bumps up to 68 days the day that I would come back to Denmark.

solotravel,1ggb6ac,Ho Chi Minh City trip report: pretty nice!,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ggb6ac/ho_chi_minh_city_trip_report_pretty_nice/,17,"Hi solo travel community! I’m on a long solo travel right now, entering month 4 (though at this point time has long since stopped making sense). You may also remember me from writing about Angkor Wat last month. 

I arrived from Cambodia into Ho Chi Minh City by bus on a stormy day, but I was a bit charmed by my introduction to Vietnam. I spoke to a Vietnamese woman on the bus who gave me a bunch of recommendations, and I was looking forward to giving them a try.

Saigon reminded me of Bangkok in many ways, but whereas I never felt connected to Bangkok, I felt like HCMC had more of a personality to me. For example, the most touristy street, Bui Vien, was the spitting image of Khao San road in Bangkok, but whereas Khao San road felt gross and I hated every moment I was on it, on Bui Vien I found myself thinking it was kind of cool and interesting. That being said, I’m not much of a partier, and prefer being “off the beaten track”, so I didn’t spend much time there.

I spent most of my time in Saigon reading in cafes, eating some nice and cheap Michelin listed restaurants, going to the gym, and just “living my life”. To me this is where Saigon excelled — not with touristy things to do, but with creature comforts and livability.

The one exception to that is the war museum. I went to the presidential palace too, which while cool, is skippable. The war museum however is definitely not skippable. It’s intense, it’s powerful, and it’s a must visit if you’re in the city. It’s near the same level of intensity as the Hiroshima museum — and has similarly frightening images of those unfortunate enough to have to deal with the consequences afterwards. Seeing the effects of the chemical warfare, and reading the stories of American brutality made me feel very self conscious of myself as an American in that space. That is, until I saw a couple of French guys doing an army salute with smiles in front of a US Army helicopter outside for photos. The utter disrespect of that just really took me aback. Be respectful people, is it that hard?

The two main tourist day trips near Ho Chi Minh City are tunnels from the Vietnam war, and day trips to the Mekong Delta. As for the tunnels, they sounded very touristy and the idea of shooting AK47s there just rubbed me the wrong way. I like history, but I don’t need to go there to learn about it. Going to the war museum definitely validated that thought. For the Mekong Delta, what I was told is that it’s the countryside, there’s a slower pace of life, it’s nice to see this unique region of Vietnam. I decided that instead of doing a day trip, why not just head there on my own and stay a couple nights?

solotravel,1ggnpn5,Solo Safari in Kruger,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ggnpn5/solo_safari_in_kruger/,10,"Hello solotravellers.

After a long time of searching for holiday destinations, I finally decided to go on a trip to South Africa. I have never been to SA or continent of Africa in general and my brain is about to explode due to so many possibilities and combinations to do this trip so I thought I ask for help from fellow solotravellers.

First of all I have done fair amount of solo trips so I feel comfortable doing this on my own. However I like to meet people and socialize along the way. I don't have a set budget but I like to get the best value for money. I am not in search of a luxury safari experience, I want to experience the wilderness as it is meant to be so I am more than happy to stay in a budget tent as long as I can share memories around the campfire with other solo travellers or travellers in general.

Outline is as follows:

Dates: 9th-23rd of December

3-4 days of safari in Kruger

4 days of Garden Route

6 days of Cape Town.

My main worry is safari in Kruger because there is so many possibilities and I am overwhelmed by them. The more I look into it, the more complicated it gets so your help would be greatly appreciated.

My first question is, does it matter if I start from Kruger or CPT in terms of the joy I get from this trip? at first I was thinking of doing the CPT part first then Kruger but it turns out if I do the trip hometown-JNB &JNB-CPT&CPT-hometown I save around $100 compared to starting from CPT. So I consider starting from Kruger.

Secondly, I am still not sure if I should buy a complete Safari package (accommodation, game drives, transportation etc.) or book them individually. Most of the Safari packages I checked online have accommodation outside of the park but I would prefer to stay inside the park to get the full experience. The ones with in-park accommodation are over my budget.

So here is the outline of what I planned so far:

After I fly to JNB from hometown, I plan to take a flight to Skukuza or Nelspruit airport. I assume that transportation from the airport to my rest camp would be challenging and pricey, eventhough I prefer having guided tours inside the park, I consider renting a car from the airport and drive to my accommodation (unless it is not safe to drive in daytime?). As for the accommodation I am looking into Lower Sabie Rest Camp as they have more affordable options but I dont know how animal population is around this camp, so I am open to suggestions.

First day (maybe also the second day) I am planning to do guided tour that I book at my camp so I get a bit of insight of the park, animals, hotspots etc. Then I self drive for the next 2 days to get the best of both worlds. Then I drop off the car and take a flight to CPT.

I am sorry for the long post but I hope you take a moment to share your opinion and suggestions about my trip.

Thank you very much in advance.",2024-10-31 20:05:29

When I mentioned I’d be visiting Colombia, they kindly offered to show me around and give me a ride, which was really exciting. As we discussed my itinerary, they suggested accompanying me on a road trip to my next destination instead of flying (a six-hour drive). I love spontaneous trips like this, and I’ve never done a road trip in another country, so I eagerly agreed. However, I now feel a bit uneasy, as I’m very used to traveling on my own.

Of course, the best part about solo travel is the flexibility and only being responsible for myself. When I travel with others, I tend to prioritize their happiness, often by following whatever they want to do and disregard my own.

On one hand, I think this could be a great opportunity to learn how to travel with someone else while not feeling responsible for their emotional well-being. On the other hand, I worry that I might not enjoy the trip as much as I would if I were doing it solo.

Hi, I'm (20s F) planning a solo trip to Hanoi for end of the year. For context, I drive a motorcycle everyday and am quite experienced driving even in the mountains (Bali).  

I'm more worried about the higher traffic areas as I've seen videos of riders and they seem much more rushed than in Bali (which have more traffic jams but slower drivers?). Crossing the street as pedestrians also seems harder. 
Do you think it's easy/safe for riders to adjust? Is it actually just about the same as in Bali? 

Another question is parking, is it easy to find parking spots for your motorcycle? Is Grab far more convenient after all?


Also any day trip (maybe on motorbike?) from Hanoi you all can recommend? I have trips to Sa Pa and Ninh Binh planned already, so none of those. 

PS Any tips, even on accommodations/activities are welcome. Would love activities that force me to be more social.

so i was thinking about signing up for one of those 18-30 yr olds group trips where like a bunch of solo travellers and small groups travel together, but the trips with all of the places i would like to see only stay at each place for a day, maybe 2. the hostels you stay in are usually not great and i know the part of travelling the world is to go see the sights and it’s not about where you stay, but i live in a low class house already and i rarely get the chance the travel so when i do go on a holiday, i like to stay in a decent place. i’m not saying it has to be extravagant, but i would prefer not to stay somewhere that needs TLC or is dirty. and then on top of that the prices for these planned group trips (that i’ve seen at least) are so much more expensive than if you were to pay to do all of this yourself. 

i’ve briefly researched about staying at just really social hostels or party hostels but i’m still worried that even then there is a chance that most days of my trip i would still end up exploring on my own because it isn’t guaranteed that you meet and connect with people in these hostels and i’m just not sure i would actually be totally safe completely on my own if i were to get into some sort of trouble or was having a problem. so i think meeting other tourists around my age to explore with is probably essential for me if i want to travel. 

i’m just looking for advice. maybe if you have any hostels/group trips or any programs that would help me out and cater to what i’m looking for to be able to travel that would be greatly appreciated. the places i’m thinking of travelling to first is definitely Greece; top 3 choices Santorini, Paros & Rhodes, Greece. then i’m hoping Italy; i can’t scale it down to top 3 but my favourites are Amalfi Coast (Positano), Lake Como, Venice, Capri, Sicily, Puglio.. there are so many😭 and to end the trip i’m thinking of staying in St. Julians, Malta since it’s right next to Italy and Malta is high up on my bucket list places to travel too. in the future maybe 2026/27 i’m thinking my next trip would be most likely Spain and France. 

i know i listed a lot of places and a trip with all of those places i listed in Greece and Italy would be expensive, but i’m prepared to save up for a while for this trip and even then i’m just looking for recommendations and advice on these places because they’re my top picks, in the end i might not go to all of them but it is handy to know information about these places for future travel plans. sorry this is a long ass post, i really would appreciate your guys’ input. thanks ☺️ ",2024-10-31 04:11:32

This would be next fall, 2025.

Ive solo traveled before but never been to Europe and I’m overwhelmed by the multitude of choices. So I’d love to hear from people here what they enjoyed/what they would suggest based on the following:

* Love art, would certainly want to see museums or even contemporary galleries
* Not a huge partier, but I’ll certainly go out at least once or twice over my trip if I can
* Water views or opportunities for going to the beach, river cruising, boat riding, ferries, etc 
* Diverse cultural areas are a huge huge plus for me (I am an early 30s Black American)

Doesn’t need to be an overly touristy city/region, though I don’t mind it. I’m working on my French starting today! So hopefully at least I’ll be conversational? By then. 

Any advice would be so lovely. So far other than a few days in Paris (what neighborhoods? I haven’t even gotten that far), and finding a lovely town on the beach in Spain, I don’t have many ideas. Because the residency is in eastern France I’m also considering a couple days in Luxembourg or maybe Switzerland?

solotravel,1gfw85g,Advice on First Solo Trip to Austria,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gfw85g/advice_on_first_solo_trip_to_austria/,2,"hi! I (21F) am planning my first solo trip ever for 2025 mid june to early july (13 days) as a graduation gift to myself and i've chosen to explore Austria for the beautiful scenery, rich culture, billy joel, and because i heard its one of the more safer places to travel alone (fingers crossed its true!).

based on rudimentary research and my interests, the cities that call to me are Vienna, Salzburg, Graz and Innsbruck, but i want to keep it three places just so i can really take the time to explore and relax on my own terms. heres my current rough itinerary:

\- 3 nights in Vienna

\- 3 nights in Salzburg

\- 3 nights in Graz OR Innsbruck

\- back to Vienna for 3 more nights

i'm pretty set on Salzburg, as well as starting and ending the trip in Vienna since thats what best for me cost-wise for when i fly back home, however, i'm flip flopping on whether i should switch Graz with Innsbruck. from what i've seen, Innsbruck is more known for its winter activities so i'm not sure it would be worth it to visit in the summer months. i know there's tons of hikes i could do, but since its my first solo trip i'm just a little wary of hiking alone in a foreign country. on the other hand, i've read that Graz has a good night life which would suit the purposes of this trip pretty well, but i'm not sure if that would still apply in early july, especially since i'd be visiting in the middle of the week rather than a weekend.

so for those who've been to either, should i spend my time in graz or innsbruck? or, is there an overlooked option that i should consider? also, does this seem like enough/too much time in each city? and finally, any must see attractions?

any and all advice would be really appreciated!!!",2024-10-30 20:19:23

I will be a solo 23yo female travelling from Feb to May 2025 throughout Asia. I haven't booked yet so everything is still possible to change, but I am most likely going to fly into Singapore and fly home from Kuala Lumpur. I'm from Melbourne, Australia. 

I'm pretty set on the first month and a bit of the itinerary (up until the end of the tour). So here's what I'm planning so far (open to any and all suggestions): 

* Fly into Singapore and spend 6 nights there. 
* Next, head to Bangkok for 5 nights. 
* After this, I will have a 26-day tour across Cambodia and Vietnam from South to North. 
* The tour finishes in Hanoi. 

This is where I start to question everything and really need your help... My initial plan below...

* I will spend 1 extra night in Hanoi before travelling to Laos. 
* Spend 9 nights in Laos then head to Chiang Rai for 4 nights.
* Next, head to Chiang Mai for 8 nights. 
* After that, 7 nights in Phuket.
* 5 nights in Langkawi.
* 4 nights in Penang. 
* 5 nights in Kuala Lumpur. 

I will probably look to mix between flights and public transportation to go between cities. Recommendations on this welcome. 

I would love to have your help and advice with: 

* Where am I spending too long?
* What am I missing that I should see?
* Should I re-order any of the cities for better efficiency?
* What's the best way to get between these cities?
* Any other helpful advice you may have for me! 

This is going to be my first solo trip planned for Asia, as I've previously only done pre-organised group trips (to Bali, Malaysian Borneo and Shanghai in Asia) in Asia, and have solo travelled for a few weeks in the West Coast of the USA. 

Thanks so much in advance!! ",2024-10-29 08:33:48

I'm planning a solo trip to the Northeast USA and hoping to visit Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. I have around two weeks to explore! Last year, I did a similar trip in California with a friend, where we hit SF, LA, San Diego, and Las Vegas, and it was awesome.

I'm a huge fan of American sports, so I like to time my trips around the NBA and NFL seasons. Since I’m wrapping up my degree in early December, I thought I’d make a visit to the East Coast around mid-December and be back just before New Year’s.

Here’s my rough plan:

* **2 Days in Boston**: Start in Boston, aiming to catch a Celtics game.
* **7 Days in NYC**: Travel to NYC, hopefully catching both Jets and Knicks games.
* **1-2 Days in Philadelphia**: Head to Philly and see an Eagles game.
* **1-2 Days in Washington, DC**: Finish up in DC before flying home.

Beyond sports, I’m also into historical and cultural sites, like museums or similar spots, as well as the usual tourist highlights, since this will be my first time on the East Coast.

So, my questions are: Is this plan realistic? And is mid-December a good time for a Northeast trip, or would I be better off at a different time? Any feedback or tips would be super appreciated!",2024-10-29 10:17:46

Seeking advice and recommendations from people who have solo travelled to MX beach locations.

I've decided on Mexico and have done a tonne of research on a number of locations.

Some info about me and what I’m looking for I’m 30F. This will be my first time travelling solo for a week, l've done a couple days in Turkey. I've travelled quite a bit in my days, I did study abroad program in Malaysia, visited Thailand and Singapore whilst I was there so I've seen some beautiful beaches. I’ve decided I need a solo trip because I’ve been feeling pretty burnt out and uninspired in my corporate job, I also live in London so the weather is a bummer so I really want a ‘reset’ type of trip and to come away feeling inspired.

Looking for somewhere walkable, chill, with great beaches for some reset time, opportunities to socialise with digital nomads/travellers, and that has awesome food! Important things, looking for somewhere that isn't too difficult to get to as it's my first time travelling, somewhere safe and not heavily overrun with tourists although I don’t mind tourists - I would like somewhere I can immerse myself in culture.

Some of the areas l've been looking at are San pancho, puerto escondido, sayulita, Isla mujeres and holbox. 

I’m leaning towards Isla Mujeres, due to the stunning beaches, it’s easy to get to, safety seems good also. 

I’m seeking advice from solo travellers who have visited Isla Mujeres, what were the pros and cons? Is 7 days too long? As well as hotel recommendations, my budget max £80-90 p/night. Aiming for November for a week if that's helpful.

If you have visited any of the other locations and you rate them higher for a solo chill, authentic (but not boring) trip, would be open to hear why!

I'm planning a solo trip to Colombia for this December and would love some feedback on my itinerary! I will be traveling as a solo female (27) but based on what I've read it seems like I should be fine safety wise as long as I stay careful. 

This is one of the more complex trips I think I've ever planned! Colombia is larger than I expected, I'm used to being able to take last minute busses places but the busses take so much time here that I'm opting for flights instead. That locks my itinerary down way more than I'm used to, so I would really appreciate your feedback so that I don't accidentally get myself stuck somewhere I don't want to be because all my flights are already booked. 

Historically, I've mostly solo traveled in South East Asia and I have also done one trip to Costa Rica. I speak Spanish well enough to have conversations with locals, though not perfectly we get by with ease. :) I'm traditionally not a city person and prefer nature. Since this is a solo trip, I am interested in spending some time in some more interesting cities to explore. I do enjoy some museums. Ideally, my goals for the trip are to hike, surf, scuba, and (maybe, not required) try to learn some salsa. Strong believer that vibes matter as much as the activities do! 

  
Day 1 - Arrive to Medellin late night, stay in hotel near the airport (I can also arrive to Bogota but thought maybe Medellin was a nicer city and doing both seems tough from my itinerary?) 

Days 2-3 Explore Medellin. Maybe: Memory House Muesum, Comuna 13, Salsa lesson, Chiva, Parque Arvi. Day trip to Guatape

Days 4-7 Flight to Los Andres. Scuba trip. Thinking of staying on Los Andres and then day trip to Providencia at some point. Admittedly, I've not done much research on this but know it's recommended and could be a nice dive spot.

Day 8 Flight to Santa Marta and explore: Public Market and Quinta de San Pedro 

Days 9-12 4 Day Lost City Trek

 Days 13-15 Tayrona Parque. Also haven't researched the details but wanted to spend a day hiking, see Cabo San Juan and I heard there may be some good dive spots here as well. I recently read that perhaps this is overrated.

Days 16-17 Stay in Costeno to relax and surf

Day 18 Check out Palomino and Surf

Day 19 Minca: waterfalls, hikes, swimming (maybe need 2 days?)

Day 20 Travel to Cartegena, Explore: Old Walled City, Castillo San Felipe, Palacio de Inquisicion

Day 21 - See the Pink Sea

Day 22 - Early morning flight 

  
So that's the rough itinerary I have. I would really love your feedback if there's something I should change or maybe add? Hopefully I've provided enough information to make that easy! Really can't thank y'all enough, if this was a trip where I could be more flexible and just wing it, I'm not sure I would be posting. But since it's more set in stone, I'm excited to hear if I've made any planning errors. Especially since the majority of my trip is in the Santa Marta area and I hadn't really expected that!

**Quick edit: when I say I haven't done much research i mean I don't have all the logistics sorted. I've read over 50 articles and watched a ton of videos at this point to gather a ton of info and recommendations about all of Colombia. I prefer loose itineraries in general so I can go with what feels right in the moment. ",2024-10-29 13:33:25

I am planning a 2nd trip back to Japan in early 2025, and would be going for approx 4 weeks. I have been to Japan early 2024 and did the classic golden route (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto) as well as Hiroshima. This time I will be dividing the trip between Kyushu and the central Alps. Some feedback and suggestions would be really appreciated.

**Part 1 : Kyushu**

**4 days Fukuoka :**  
Arrival day and getting my bearings first. Planning a separate day for both Hakata and West-Fukuoka. Outside of the most popular sightseeing spots, planning to visit the city museum and Teamlabs forest. Reserving one day for a trip to Dazaifu (and maybe combining with Nanzo-in).

**3 days Nagasaki :**  
Spending my first (half) day by visiting Museum of History and Culture and the peace park. Inasayama observation deck in the evening. Next day will be spent visiting most of the famous sightseeing spots (excluding Huis ten Bosch as I am from Western Europe). Depending on the weather might take a boat to Gunkajima in the early morning. Last day will be a day trip to Shimabara to visit the castle and samurai district in the morning and do a little walk in the Unzen-Amakusa National park in the afternoon.

**2 days Kumamoto :**  
Pretty straightforward, spending the first day seeing some of the more known sightseeing spots (such as Reigando cave, the castle, Kamitori, ... ) and spending the second day on a trip to Mount Aso.

**1 day Kagoshima :**  
Passing by on the way to Yakushima. Not a lot planned, might visit Sakurajima or visit the Museum of the Meiji Restoration. Getting up early next day for the ferry to Yakushima.

**3 days Yakushima :**  
Will be arriving around 1PM at the hotel in Anbo. Spending the first day in the neighborhood. Might visit Yakusigi museum as well. Second day I will be doing some hiking in the Shiratani Unsui Gorge, might visit Miyanoura in the remainder of the afternoon. Last day I'll get up early to hike in Yakusugi Land, might visit Senpiro-No-Taki and Toroki-No-Taki falls.

I have read that renting a car is the easiest option here, but not looking forward driving in a foreign country on a different side of the road (have not used a car in years). So will try to depend on the bus, have already checked the driving schedule.

**Part 2 : Central Alps and Tohoku**

**1 day Osaka :**  
Taking the plane from Yakushima to Osaka as the fastest and cheapest option to get to central alps. Will spend the day chilling in Osaka, getting some rest from the past two weeks. Will spent most of the day visiting some pubs.

**3 days Kanazawa :**  
First day will be spent on some sightseeing spots and maybe a museum (Kanazawa castle, Higashi Chaya, Kenroku-en garden, Nagamachi district, ... ). Second day will be a day trip to Fukui, visiting the dinosaur museum, Eiheiji temple and walking the Tojinbo cliffs before going back. Last day in Kanazawa will be spent visiting Seisonkaku Villa, Myoryuji (ninja temple), maybe D.T. Suzuki Museum and some shopping.

**3 days Takayama :**  
Spending the first day on some interesting sightseeing spots such as Takayama Jinya, Miyagawa market, Sanmachi Suji and Kokubun-ji Tempel. Maybe also the Takayama Museum of local history. Second day I will visit Hida no Sato village and walking the Higashiyama route. Last day will be a daytrip to Shirakawa-Go village.

**2 days Nagano :**  
Again, first day spending on some of the sightseeing spots (Zenko-Ji temple, Matsushiro Samurai District, Naka-Mise Street) . Might visit Nagano Chausuyama Zoo. Second day will be a daytrip to Matsumoto

**2 days Nikko :**  
Had to skip this on my first trip, but looking forward to making up for this. Will be spending a day around the city, as well as the closer spots such as Toshogu bridge and shrine. Second day will be spent hiking to Yudaki Waterfalls (or further, if possible).

**3 days Sendai :**  
Will chose Sendai as base for day trips to both Yamadera and Matsushima. Will spent one full day in Sendai going to the well know sightseeing spots ( Zuihoden Mausoleum , Aoba castle, Jozenji-dori , ... )

**4 days Tokyo :**  
Last part of the trip. Not really planned anything as I have already been here for a week.

Some additional info :

I mainly like sightseeing the more famous spots in each place, as well as trying new foods everywhere, visiting some museums and having a few days spent in nature instead of the cities. I will be traveling solo just as last time and use public transport for everything.

I also like to just spend an hour or two having a beer and writing in my journal, or sitting in a park reading a book, to unwind a bit. Tips for restaurants and/or pubs are always welcome.

Looking forward to all your suggestions !",2024-10-28 21:58:26

About me/Preferences:

I enjoy the simplicity of walking around and taking in the view of places and cities. I also love nature and the outdoors whether it’s mountains, beaches, rainforests, etc. I’m up for long hikes away from big crowds and cities (can’t do backpacking this trip though). I’m fast paced and have a high budget, so please give as many places to see as possible since I’m good to keep on the move with expenses such as flights and car rentals.

I met a girl recently who has a boyfriend back home but they decided to open the relationship while she travels and they're both sleeping around with a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.

I've met other people who broke up with their partners when they left to travel, some ""for good"", others with the intention of getting back together when they're done travelling (if they/their exes haven't found someone new, I guess?).

My personal situation is that I met someone really amazing, we dated for three months or so but decided not to attempt a long distance relationship when I left to travel as it seemed like too much pressure on such a new relationship. I'd like to have the chance to explore things further with him one day but as you can tell from me making this post I'm a bit nervous about whether I've done the right thing, haha. My mentality is very much one of ""if it's meant to be, it's meant to be"" but I find long distance really anxiety-inducing, personally.

I am planning to be in India starting early January and was hoping to do a yoga retreat before (over New Years). Would love any recommendations for retreats people have enjoyed that are suitable for a solo female traveller!

I am thinking something in Kerala, Goa, or Rishikesh, but would also be open to Bali or Phuket area in Thailand. Ideally the retreat would be no more than 7 days, combine yoga with some sort of healing / wellness element (I am interested in maybe exploring Ayurveda), and be in a more nature-y vs urban area (opportunities to do nature walks or near a beach, etc.). This will be my first yoga retreat and I'm hoping to feel refreshed and grounded going into the new year.

solotravel,1gdfptp,Social solo travel,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gdfptp/social_solo_travel/,79,"I recently did a one week backpacking trip in Laos. I decided ahead that i wanted it to be a social solo, meaning to make it a point to meet people. 

I started the trip somewhat dreaded due to heavy work the day before, but once i arrive at the airport check in, i told myself to be interesting and be interested.

All in all, i chatted with about 50 strangers in my 9 day trip, and it was a solo but social trip that i really enjoyed. I did excursions with new friends, went out with attractive opposite sex, had great 2 hout breakfast chat w the hostel owner that he even told me its an interesting talk he had for a long time. 

I warmed up by chatting to fellow travels on flight, obviously i was very lucky because it was a long flight wait and i spoke to six people including the air stewardess.

The challenging part was speaking to strangers in Luang Prabang when i arrived. I started off with the driver but he was grumpy, and once i arrive i walked around town and night market chatting with around ten people. 

The next day i went to Kuang Si and spoke to the person beside me, a German professor. and this was the drill for me for the next nine days. I had to consciously speak to the first 2-3 person in the beginning of the day, the rest will be easy. And the nice thing is when others see us chatting, they also become friendly and try to join the conversations, so one thing leads to another. 

I learnt that
- take initiative to interact
- iwarm up, meaning say good morning the first person you see, say the cleaner and ask questions. eg: where to eat a good breakfast. 
- interact with everyone, dont limit yourself to an age range or anything. My best chat was with a 79 year old man this trip.
- be kind and dont expect anything. Sometimes people don’t respect to strangers and its perfectly fine, just move on. When you speak with kindness you project good energy, this also helped me to speak to opposite sex, and i had a blast going to the lagoons with two beatiful Austrian friend. And naturally some people came and chat with us as the three or us travelled. 
- Be generous. i am at an age 40M where i can buy a fellow traveller a beer. I know going dutch is the protocol, but i believe people appreciates it and usually reciprocates, worse case i just tell people that’s the Asian side of me haha. 
- focus on their story. Everyone travelling has a story, ask them what brought them here and really listen, dont listen for the sake or asking question but to understand them.

I've traveled to 12 countries so far (Mainly Europe and Central America) and this is my first time solo traveling. I'll be leaving for El Salvador in just over two weeks. I'll be staying for six days and will be by myself. This is not my first time in Central America (I've Been to Honduras and Guatemala and loved both) I've already booked my hotels so at this point I'm trying to finalize excursions/activities for the week I'm there while jumping from city to city. I'm excited about El Salvador, and I wanted to get some suggestions and recommendations.

After extensive research, I decided to visit 3 major cities and they are all within an hour or so from one another: San Salvador, Santa Ana & El Tunco. I realize El Tunco is known as the ""Surf City"" and although I don't know how to surf, I still really want to see the nightlife and explore the nearby beaches. 

I did research into staying in Santa Ana as it fits my schedule best especially since I want to hike the Santa Ana Volcano. 

With that being said, I have a budget of around $300 (not super strict) for activities and my interests include: hiking, learning about new cultures, exploring nature, art museums, attending cooking classes, finding cool bars, and attending sports events. Big Foodie as well so I always ask for suggestions as I like to truly get a feel for each country I visit and embrace the country's cuisine. It looks like pupusas are the national dish of El Salvador and they seem to be found just about everywhere. 

  
I should note that I understand and speak basic Spanish. I understand it better than I speak but I CAN ask for help, order from restaurants, and basically get by with the limited knowledge I do have (currently taking classes and have some friends that speak Spanish so I'm around it quite often). If all else fails, I have google translate lol

  
Would love to get some tips, suggestions, and feedback or anything that will help me experience an enjoyable trip!

Day 1:

* Fly in at noon
* Explore a little downtown San Salvador

Day 2:

* El Tunco
* Explore the beaches

Day 3:

* Drive to Santa Ana
* Explore Santa Ana
* Trip to Chalchuapa to see Mayan Ruins

Day 4:

* Hike Santa Ana Volcano
* Explore the rest of Santa Ana

Day 5:

* Drive back to San Salvador 
* Half day in San Salvador

Day 6:

* Full day in San Salvador

Day 7:

* Fly back at 3PM",2024-10-28 14:33:26

I want to travel more, but right now, the biggest hindrances are flights and the expense of traveling solo (not having someone to split costs with).

So, what do you guys use to find cheap flights or airline sales (specifically international/long-haul flights from the east coast of the U.S.)? I know of all the mainstream options like (google flights, Skyscanner, kayak, etc.) and (going and the like). My issue is that it’s almost always the same handful of places (typically just the mainstream locations), and if I want to look at smaller cities to transfer to a bigger one, I have to specifically look them up. I also don’t like that, more often than not, sites like Skyscanner have inaccurate flight prices. I also don’t want to pay a subscription to mailing lists that only find “deals” for the same ten cities. I understand that finding good flight prices has become such a rarity with the increased popularity of miles and price hacking, but I’m hoping there’s still something good out there. I’m willing to pay for the service, but only if it’s actually doing work (i.e., something I can’t just do with a Google flights search).

If this is completely unrealistic or just unclear feel free to let me know that as well :). I'm just trying to figure out how to make this work while I have the time and health to freely travel. How do you make solo travel still affordable? I appreciate any advice or suggestions.",2024-10-27 23:05:23

i dont intend to drive due to being a newly licensed driver in an unfamiliar terrain, so good public infrastructure is vital. coming from an extremely safe country, i have gotten too comfortable to somewhere so safe, and i am hoping to find somewhere that is relatively safe for a start.

i made a list of what i think would fit my criteria, but i don’t mind looking at other countries! fyi: the areas i have decided to land in first is where ticket prices are typically the cheapest

I am traveling for 2 weeks in New Zealand in December, first landing in Aukland. I'm hoping to get some advice on things to do, what to eat, what to avoid? Recommended places to stay? Was it easy to find lodging (preferably not hostels bc I really need the quiet these days haha) without having to plan in advance? Is public transportation readily available in the cities?

My plan is to spend a week in North Island, slowly traveling down, then take the ferry to South Island and stay there for the last week before flying back home from Christchurch. This is my first time traveling solo internationally, so to say I'm nervous would be a major understatement. 

I am most nervous about driving. I understand the left side driving and the car being on the opposite than what is usual in the U.S., but how are the roads? The adjustment period? I read that there are a lot of roundabouts, which fortunately for me are actually quite common in my state, but I'm assuming it goes clockwise in NZ if that's correct? Was it easy to get to places? 

A few things on my itinerary that I really want to do is see the glow worm cave, Rotorua, penguins, star gaze, Hobbiton tour/feast, and hiking to a few of the LOTR sites and part of the Key Summit trails. I'm reaaaallly hoping to fit in a Doubtful Sound cruise in there towards the end of my trip if possible.

Is this a reasonable itinerary? I'm trying to take it easy and not overwhelm myself with trying to fit in too many activities. ",2024-10-28 03:13:58

I just returned from my second solo trip, this time to Athens. On both of my solo adventures, I've found myself meeting groups of people, usually older (40+), either because the spot is touristy or I’ve joined a guided activity. Every time I'm in these situations, at least one person (often more) asks if I’m traveling solo, how long I’m traveling for, and so on. When they find out I’m travelling alone, their first response is usually something like, “Good for you,” or “That’s awesome.”

While I genuinely enjoy traveling solo and plan to keep doing it regardless of others' opinions, there’s something indescribably validating about hearing this from strangers. It’s a little reminder of the courage it takes to go on these journeys alone, and it makes the experience even more rewarding.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did it make you feel?

Status update: I've paid my lunch and I've told the case to Muhammad, the other guy in charge.  I've told him clearly that I want to step out from the camp site and head to the village safely.

I'll keep updating my status.

------original post below------
Very long story because it is happening RIGHT NOW. I want to keep as much detail as possible.

I, 39f, am doing solo travel in Morocco and currently in my 4d3n desert tour, 3rd day and 1 more night in the camp site.

As a female traveler, I learned to be kind to local people while still keep the cautious. Today this is way over the boundary to me.

I choose to stay one more day in the desert without doing any activities, because I want to enjoy some time in a chilled and slow vibe. So when the boy, 24, working in the camp site, was surprised that I don't want to do anything, I thought he's just to bored. This is understandable so I said nothing. He keeps the conversation going and even asking me to drop the phone and talk to him, which is a bit annoying to me already. However I kept telling myself that he's too young to know that ""doing nothing is enjoyable.""

As the conversation going on, mainly he asks and I answered, he ask to take over my phone to follow him in Instagram, like a promotion, asked me to do some good reviews. I followed him on Instagram and said the review will be provided as after the trip.

Then he asked again if I want to visit somewhere or doing any activities. I said, ""My plan today is to do nothing and enjoy the view and wind and chill here.""

Then he asked why am I traveling along, married? Single? I told him seriously that I enjoy being single as I want. 
(1 red flag here)

Then the conversation comes again to if I want to do anything or play any board game today? My answer is that no I don't want to do anything.

This pattern keeps repeated for more than 4 times. The conversation always comes to that I don't want to do anything.

Then he offered me if I want to have lunch outside, and I said yes. During my lunch, he asked if I would like to share my lunch with him. And I say no, I don't share my lunch with strangers.
(2nd red flag)

Then again, the doing any activities questions vs I don't want to do anything answers. 

Then he asked what I will be doing after the tour. I said I'll be heading to Fez and Tangier, then Spain. He JOKED to join my trip. I refused. I don't travel with someone I don't know like that.
( He claimed to be joking afterwards, which still 3rd red flag to me)

Then it came to asking my personal phone number, which I again refuses and said Instagram is good enough.
( He also claimed to be joking afterwards but still the 4th red flag to me)

Then he's embarrassed or pissed maybe, I don't care. When taking about the lunch fee 150 MAD as told, I wanted to check the possibility of paying to others. 

He said that I don't trust him and he is the only one being nice.

Ok this is way too much and I don't need to carry your feeling.

I spole loudly and say ""Yes, I don't trust you at all because you've been talking to me, asking my personal information, asking too much for the entire morning while I've told you I want a peaceful day here. For so many times."" "" I feel offended and threatened especially I need to be stay here for one more night."" And things like them, loudly for others staffs to get involved. To take home away.

So I am going to pay my lunch fee with my decision about the schedule for tomorrow morning to another boy in charge.

However, I really don't know what would happen later, and if I can have a peaceful night til tomorrow.

Please let me post the case here and I'll update my situation just in case.",2024-10-26 15:05:11

Hi everyone, 

I’m super new to solo traveling and this will be my first experience doing so! I am a 27M who is planning to stay in Barcelona for 4 days after a 12 day cruise with family. I am someone who loves and adores architecture, modern art, and museums and I felt Barcelona would be the perfect place to spend a few days before heading back home. I’ll be in Barcelona mid-January 2025. I did some research and chose a hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. Although a bit more expensive, I know I’ll be safe in that neighborhood!

The main places I have marked that I definitely want to visit are: 

La Sagrada Familia
Museu Picasso
Casa Batllo
Park Guell
El Palau de la Música Catalana

Other places that have interested me but am unsure about at this time are:

Catalunya National Art Museum
Montjuic Castle
MEAM (European Museum of Modern Art)
Moco Museum

I know I most likely won’t be able to see all of them in such a short amount of time but would love opinions on what places you recommend in Barcelona and am open to hearing other suggestions outside of what’s listed

Thank you in advance 🫶",2024-10-27 17:51:44

However, as soon as I finish seeing these places, I have the strong urge to go home and get a panic attack if I don't. The panic attack won't go away until I see my return flight coming soon. I try distracting myself with books, movies, games when there isn't much to do but it doesn't help much. Calling my family and friends and talking reduces the anxiety a lot but I'm most comfortable when I'm on the return flight back home when I can truly relax.

  
Normally it wouldn't be an issue, but I'm planning to travel internationally which would probably need to be at least a week to be worth it given the long flights, but not sure if I will have enough stuff to do before I run out and panic. Not sure what to do.

  
The panic is basically some unease, followed by full blown attack of nausea, fast heart beat, feelings of being trapped. It greatly diminishes when my return flight is booked and coming soon. Most of the time I spend a lot of money to make last minute flight changes since I booked the vacation for 4 days instead of 3 days for example.",2024-10-28 06:04:04
solotravel,1gcw4ee,"Travelling Guatemala solo, mixed experience ",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gcw4ee/travelling_guatemala_solo_mixed_experience/,46,"Here’s my experience (M 35) of two weeks solo travelling for the first time in Guatemala in the last two weeks of October. Not exactly sure why I'm sharing this but here we go.

To start I stupidly didn’t realise I needed an ESTA for my transfer flight until checking into my flight 24 hours before. I arrived at the airport for my flight in case it came through last minute but it didn’t and missed the flight. 

The help desk gave me the wrong advice and ended up cost £280 to rebook my flight in two days time which could have been free. Lesson learnt. I also received news that I was being made redundant the week before the trip, after my work being very difficult about me taking two weeks off…

I had sublet my flat for the trip so I was then sat in the airport effectively homeless and extremely stressed. I managed to call upon someone I’m dating to stay with and actually had a great night out together instead. In hindsight those two missed days were a bit of a blessing. 

So two days late I arrived in Antiqua Guatemala in the dark and crashed out early. 

I got up early due to excitement and jetlag and experienced my first taste of a rainforest by walking up to Cerro de la Cruz which was beautiful. Also visited a coffee farm which as a huge coffee fan was a cool moment. Tried chilling in the plaza in the middle of town but would get bothered by people selling stuff too often to really relax. Tried to find a bar or something but it was quite early and everywhere was empty, went back to the Airbnb early.

Next morning I set off to do the Acatenango hike I did with Tropicana Hostel, it was a fairly young group of 20 or so. Was a nice group or people, and chatting helped ease the difficulty. The hike was genuinely incredible and got to see the lava erupt, the accommodation was super basic with everyone crammed in sleeping in a row but didn’t mind. Did the extra fuego hike at 3am with a couple other people on the tour, I may have underestimated how hard/exhausting this would be but did make it.  

Had the rest of the day in Antiqua but was battered from the hike. Just tried to kill time by sitting around in cafes. There are a couple of coffee shops like 12 Oz, which are amazing. Didn’t have the energy to find any other touristy activity to do.

Got a shuttle in the morning to Lake Atitlán and stayed in San Marcos for 3 nights in a nice Airbnb. Went to the nature reserve of arrival and just chilled there reading and sat on the lake to watch the sunset. 

Had my first breakdown after the first night, felt depressed about why/what I was doing there and cried on the phone to my family. Just felt lonely, homesick and missing my partner & friends. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this low on a holiday. Got some helpful messages which helped me eventually pull it together and got out and had a look around town and went to San Juan which was nice enough.

The best moments of the trip for me were over the next 2 days visiting the Eagles Nest for yoga classes, sauna & food. The views are spectacular and was the first place I felt truly at peace and relaxed. Was very tempted to just book in there and sack off the rest of the trip but didn’t. 

I stayed in Panachel for one night to get a coach to Senac Champey in the morning. I went to the nature reserve just out of town, which was beautiful and peaceful. Can’t say I enjoyed this evening, weather was awful, any decent place I’d been reccomended to eat was closed and the Airbnb I booked was deceptively grim and loud (should have checked better). Luckily it was short lived. 

The 10 hour journey to Senac Champey the next morning was okay as the shuttle was empty, could lie down pretty much for the whole journey.

Stayed in Utopia Eco Hotel which was actually my favourite place to stay on the trip. Arrived on the back of a truck in the dark to a power cut which was an experience. The shared meals there were nice and social, and met some of the most interesting travelers of the trip there in a similar age bracket.

The day Senac Champey was beautiful and enjoyed exploring it. The cave tour was a fun enough addition, nothing too special. The other guests on the tour though were mates travelling together, they were friendly but felt a bit like a weird spare wheel. Was a bit awkward when taking photos as I would have to get out the way or be pointlessly immortalised in their holiday photos. 

Another 10 hour shuttle the next day to Flores, which was much harder than the last coach as it was packed. Doing them just two days apart was in hindsight too much for me. 

Booked into Los Amigos hostel in for the first shared room of the trip. The place is nice enough but cemented by idea of being over the party hostel vibe. I love raving, festivals and the music scene in London, but this kind of drinking/party scene is not for me. Was in bed by 9pm as had to up before 6am, fortunately the shared room was really quiet. 

I did a group tour to Tikal but felt too rundown really to fully appreciate it, and felt like a shell being guided around and could barely bring myself interact with the other guests. Felt like I should have been at awe with what I was seeing but didn’t really have much of a strong effect on me experiencing it in person. Best part was seeing the wildlife (toucan, tarantulas, spider monkeys). The tour guide was really lovely. 

Got back around 2pm and spent the rest of the day in bed or in a quiet corner of the hostel watching YouTube videos, apart from a small trip out to eat. Had another big cry and still felt exhausted.

I’m currently in Flores at the hostel, waiting for a flight back to Guatemala City in the evening and barely moved all day. Just killing time by writing this and trying to reflect on what went right/wrong on the trip.

I think meeting similar like-minded people wasn’t as easy as I imagined. Partly because so much of the trip I have just not felt that outgoing which is a problem. Sometimes I really do but not this time. I was worried about getting bored being alone so planned a fairly busy schedule which may have been too much. 

Perhaps also I made some wrong choices of where to stay, I felt at my age I was stuck somewhere between the 20 something gap year travellers and retired Americans. Have to say that the locals have been generally super friendly and helpful, but the language barrier means interactions have been shallow. 

Posting instagram stories and getting messages about how great it looked felt so fake at times. The trip had its highlights for sure but I’ve also not felt this low at times in a good while.

I don’t know if I can see myself doing something like this solo again. I thought maybe this would hopefully spark the desire in me to do a longer trip but it has mostly crushed it. Maybe I need more time to process it all but it’s not been the escape/new experience I quite imagined. I do hope I’ll look back on it eventually as at least a worthwhile learning experience.

I booked my room on an app called Hostelworld, which I’m sure most people here have used. For those who haven’t, around 10-14 days before your check in, you get put in a massive group chat with everyone else who’s booked their rooms on there. I ended up meeting up with an American guy for a few beers on the first night, before I headed off to ADE. We still keep in touch on Instagram now!

We met up again on the second night and visited a couple museums and getting some more beers. I put a message in the chat to see who was out, and told them what pub we were in, and within 10 minutes, 6 people turned it. It was so cool. 

There were periods in the day when I was kinda bored on my own, but once I started meeting up and chatting with people, I didn’t even feel like I was away from home. I’m so excited to book my next trip!

This has been a bit of a monologue. But if anyone is hesitant on pulling the trigger on solo travelling….DO IT!! I can’t recommend it enough, you’ll meet so many cool people who are on the same boat as you.

I am doing a 2-week solo trip with meeting friends for a couple of days in Europe.

3 days in Belgium - I plan to keep Brussels as the main location and do day trips to Bruges, and Ghent and explore Brussels one day.

6 days in Spain - Mallorca, Seville, Barcelona with 2 days each. I am worried if it is too tight and if I can cover everything. The other option is to skip Seville and cover only Mallorca and Barcelona with 3 days each. However, I have heard much about Seville, especially the good weather in November and December.

next week I'm travelling to Edinburgh for the first time (and also the first time to Scotland or the UK in general). for about 9 days.  
It is my second travel alone, and the first one out of my own country (and therefore my comfort zone - it's been soo long since I've been visiting another country). But when I saw pictures of Edinburgh in autmn, I knew I had to try this out. I'm in my mid-20s, male and from Germany.

Normally I don't really have problems with being on my own. However, I really like to socialize, especially if I am in a new situation anyway. I'm not the most extrovert person though, so I might need help with the whole topic. On my last vacation in a small town here in Germany, it was rather difficult, mainly because there were hardly any people my age.

Basically, I'd be interested to know the best way to meet new people (especially in terms of Edinburgh, but also in general when traveling). I'm not talking about dating or anything like that, but simply meeting nice people to get new impressions or in case it should get too lonely for me.

1) Are there any good places to meet people? Preferably around my age range, students, other tourists, etc. I've often read that in Edinburgh, you can just sit down in a pub and chat to people... Is that really the case? Unfortunately, I can't imagine that with the German mentality.  
So I'd be grateful for any ideas about a particular cool bar or something else.

2) Are there certain (group)activities for tourists travelling alone that you may have had experience with? In other words, something that you can take part in on your own, without feeling ""isolated"".

  
Of course, I am also very happy to accept any other tips on the subject. 

Wish you a wonderful weekend,

Your slightly nervous Salty MuskOx",2024-10-26 09:46:55
solotravel,1gbx95o,An Ode to the Hustle,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gbx95o/an_ode_to_the_hustle/,47,"A post in recognition and celebration of the chaos, intensity and beauty of being pestered while abroad. Hustlers. Scammers. Taxi kingpins. Insistent street vendors. Call me insane; I love it all.

My appreciation of this art isn't new, but has only recently been refined into a full-on love affair through a recent trip to Egypt (Cairo, Luxor, Aswan) with a friend. Ah yes, beloved Egypt, the beating heart of this subreddit's never-going-back-there sentiment, and one of my top all-time destinations.

I truly believe that the experience of being 'pestered' while travelling is shaped by one's mindset going into it, and that all it takes is being open, easy-going and friendly to turn it into one hell of an enriching travel experience wherever one goes.

My approach couldn't be further from the often-shared advice of *""just ignore them / no eye contact / pretend they're not there"".* The fulfilment and enjoyment of it all stems from absolutely the opposite: engaging directly, and proactively, smiling, being relaxed, taking my time at my own pace, and observing the anthropological chaos in all its beauty.

I've come to see it as an entertaining verbal and emotional tango which circles different cultures, values and languages. All in bitesize chunks of several seconds at a time. With complete strangers you'll never see again, and who in most scenarios see you as simply an opportunity to make some quick cash. There's something thrilling about being foreign prey in a gauntlet of street stalls or a large market, where the exchanges are continuous, overlapping and frenzied. Maybe it's the attention (an insight into my psyche perhaps); maybe it's the simplicity of human interaction; or just the sheer frequency and volume of it in certain places (you take that prize, Cairo) which one doesn't usually get at home. I think above all it's the perception (perhaps illusion) of breaking down barriers, and having some sort of connection, even if only for an instant, with someone from a completely different walk of life. And yes that connection could just be something as absurd as an easy going ""Not today my friend, I don't need papyrus"".

For those that may argue it can be relentless or exhausting: yes. Yes it is. And that's a key element of its beauty, and crucially something which one can't take offence to. Take it as a full-bodied honour and let it overwhelm.

To finish this long and needless addition to the interweb, I'm fully aware of the caveats with this, and yes there's a distinction: obviously boundaries should never be crossed regarding aggression, intimidation, civility, or, god forbid, any sort of physicality when in another country (or anywhere). I'm a white European 28M and also acknowledge the privileges this brings when making light of being 'pestered'. But I'm talking pure and innocent hustling here; the respectable (even if not always legal) vocation of attempting to milk us cynical travellers and tourists for the sweet nectar of our expendable dinars and dirham and egyptian pounds and insert-other-random-currency-here.

So soak it up. Lean in. Embrace the chaos. Love the hustle, and love the hustlers. It makes for such a more rounded and enjoyable travel experience, rather than blocking it out or ignoring it like it doesn't exist. ",2024-10-25 15:41:19

I am at the end of a long term trip and trying to fine tune my itinerary for Brazil to ensure it all makes sense logistically. I have travelled to most other places in South and Central America so places like the Amazon I've ticked off in other countries.

I am visting from mid november to mid December and want to have a relatively relaxing time. I would have loved to head north to lençóis maranhenses but not much point given the time I'm visiting.

As a result I'm focusing on the South of the country as its also easiest to then fly back to Europe from.

This is what I currently have:

7 nights in Rio. My birthday is during this period so want to spend a good amount of time here to enjoy myself.

4 nights in Ilha Grande. Relaxing time in the tropics after Rio

3 nights in Paraty. Potentially too long spent here?

7 nights in Florianopolis. Last chance to really relax on a beach before returning to cold European winters.

2 nights in Iguazu. Explore both Brazilian and Argentinean sides. Do you need more than 2 nights to do both?

2/3 nights in Sao Paulo. Fly home from here. 


 Does this seem doable? My biggest question is really around the order of places, particularly post Ilha/Grande, does it make sense to do them in the order listed above or would it be better to go to Sao Paulo first then Iguazu, Florianopolis and then back to Sao Paulo?

I am also flexible on how I travel between buses/flights/etc.

solotravel,1gc0k79,How do you do wine tourism?,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gc0k79/how_do_you_do_wine_tourism/,13,"The one part I (27m) struggle most with while traveling solo is wine tours. I have done a handful of tours alone and I never enjoy it as much as I do when I travel with friends/my partner. More often than not on wine tours abroad (I’ve done a few in Tuscany and 2 in the Yarra Valley, Australia) the other people were usually retired seniors on their first trip abroad, middle aged couples who are doing their own thing, or people that I haven’t had a common language to communicate in. There haven’t really been other solo travelers to “buddy-up” with. Sitting at one big lunch table with everyone but essentially eating alone feels too much like high school. It could be I just have bad luck of the several draws, but I’m kinda off put by it now. 
So now I’m considering just staying in a smaller place for a week or so and just spending each day going to a winery or two on my own instead of a day trip type tour. I’d obviously prefer not to have to rent a car, but I’d consider it if the wine is worth it. 

I guess what I’m looking for are 

1. Places with decent public transit or shuttle buses (bicycles even?) to and from wineries and lodging

2. Places that attract a younger/middle aged crowd of other solo travelers. I’m not looking to party all night, just get buzzed, chitchat, and be in bed by a reasonable time

3. Wineries/vineyards you loved visiting solo and how you did it if it was not on a tour

Ideally I’m looking at 10ish days in early March, so probably the southern hemisphere (its harvest season most places) but wouldn’t be opposed to the northern if things are open/weather isn’t awful. My budget would be around $4,000USD. I mainly just want to have a relaxing week indulging in food and wine. Still fine with hostels, as long as they’re not party ones. I don’t care to do anything luxury; slightly off the beaten path is great. I prefer white wines, but not opposed to some reds; nothing sweet.

Santiago, Chile is what I was originally thinking but I’m not really wanting to have to travel that far each day to get out of the city. Viña Del Mar seems a bit too touristy and not really in wine country although next door. I thought about Santa Cruz and San Fernando but unsure. I’ve looked at Mendoza, Argentina but everything seems more spread out. I’ve also considered South Africa’s wine regions but honestly haven’t looked into it because the flights are pricy and I think it might be better to not do alone; but I can be convinced.

I explored only the European side of istanbul for now and focused on activities as well. 

Honestly, efesius and open museum in cappadocia are the places to be visited extremely early! Probably at opening time. When i went there at 9:30am, there were 5 groups of huge tour buses already at the entry gate. This kind of deteriorated my experience. 

Activities to definitely do:
1. ATV ride in cappadocia: helps explore 4 places easily at once

2. Hammam in Istanbul

3. Bosphorus Tour in Istanbul

4. Whirling Dervish

Activities you could try:
1. Scuba Diving in kaş
2. Coffee Making in Istanbul 
3. Rhythm of dance show in Istanbul

Euros are used for entry tickets in efes, istanbul and Cappadocia but for rest of the things, turkish lira is only used.

English isn’t as widely spoken as others. Istanbul or even Cappadocia is more common with English speakers but other places hardly have any English speakers.

I am trying to plan a trip to India. I plan to stay for a few months, not sure how many yet, depends on how I like it after 1-2 months there. I have a USA passport so I believe I can stay up to 6 months if I wanted to. I prefer slow travel (1 month at a time per city ideally). Thanks for taking the time to read.

I am posting here because I see a lot of mixed reviews on India but I would like to see it for myself. I’m a male traveler so perhaps certain concerns wouldn’t apply.

From my limited research I can see people recommend the South more and avoiding certain cities if you want to get a nicer experience (e.g visit Himachal Pradesh, Goa, **Kerala**, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Pondicherry).

I would like to visit Taj Mahal so I believe that means I would need to stay in Delhi (so perhaps a week or 5 days there? ). I believe there is a period of time where there are fires that burn from rice crops causing pollution during October through February. . I also hear I should not stay in Paharganj . Where and how much should I expect to pay (I usually use Airbnb).

I don’t need the best internet, or luxury. I like to have my own bathroom/room. I would like to avoid super crowded trains/buses if at all possible.

I don’t mind hectic streets, but would like to avoid pickpockets and stomach issues as much as that is possible (which are problems that can happen anywhere in the world of course).

I really enjoy nature but not a requirement. I will be self studying a lot of my time and prefer to keep a lower budget when possible.

Please let me know your thoughts.",2024-10-25 12:54:22
solotravel,1gb1c60,My 25 day Solo Euro Trip Experience,247,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gb1c60/my_25_day_solo_euro_trip_experience/,66,"I am 32 year male from India and I recently completed a 25-day solo trip across Europe, visiting five countries: France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. This was my first long solo journey, and it was an experience I’ll never forget. From breathtaking landscapes to unexpected cultural shocks, every destination had its own unique surprises. Here’s a breakdown of the trip, what I learned, and some tips for anyone considering a similar adventure.

# Planning & Logistics:

Initially, I had planned to go in July, but due to some changes with my schedule, I had to postpone the trip. Luckily, I managed to get an appointment with the French Embassy in Bangalore, and within 10 days of my VFS Global appointment, my Schengen visa was ready.

For the trip itself, I booked an Emirates flight on the A380 (something I had wanted to experience for a long time). Although my luggage didn’t make it to Paris with me, and I had to wait eight hours at the airport, the thrill of arriving in Paris for the first time made up for the delay.

I stayed in a mix of hostels and Airbnbs throughout the trip, which worked perfectly for a solo traveler like me. Getting around was easy, thanks to the Eurail Pass, which covered most of my transportation across countries. It also allowed me to enjoy some truly scenic train rides, particularly in Switzerland.

Packing light was essential. Since the weather varied between regions, I had to plan for everything—from hot days in Switzerland to cooler nights in Prague. Good walking shoes and layers were my best friends.

# Highlights:

# Paris, France - 4 days

Paris was my first stop, and I quickly learned how important it is to greet people properly. Saying ""Bonjour"" before any interaction completely changed how people responded to me. Without it, the French seemed distant, but with it, they became much more approachable. It was a small cultural quirk that I wasn’t expecting but made a big difference in my experience.

The French also take their food seriously. I had a delicious meal at a small roadside bistro, and later, out of curiosity, I checked the Google reviews—it was rated 2.9! That’s when I realized just how high the local standards are. The **Paris Metro** was another highlight—efficient, easy to navigate, and a great way to get around.

One of my favorite memories from Paris was watching locals have picnics along the Seine, some even dancing as the river cruise boats passed by. The relaxed, social vibe of the city made me fall in love with it, even though I barely scratched the surface in my four days there.

# Grindelwald, Switzerland - 5 days

After Paris, I headed to Switzerland, where I stayed in Grindelwald. Switzerland felt like a different world—everything was efficient, clean, and ran like clockwork. The natural beauty of the Swiss Alps blew me away. Jungfraujoch, the ""Top of Europe,"" was particularly stunning, and it was here that I felt truly overwhelmed by nature’s grandeur.

The Swiss are known for their premium quality in everything, and it’s no exaggeration. The transportation, the food, and even the way the tourist experiences were organized—all of it was top-notch. That said, Switzerland is expensive, but for me, it was worth every penny.

I also did something I’d never done before—riding a cable car alone. It was exhilarating and nerve-wracking at the same time, but the views from the top made it all worthwhile. One night, I even tried my hand at astrophotography, capturing the starry skies above the Alps, which became one of the most memorable moments of my trip.

# Vienna, Austria - 5 days

Vienna was next, and while the city is absolutely stunning, I found the people a bit more reserved. It wasn’t as easy to connect with locals as it was in Paris or Switzerland, but the city itself made up for it with its rich cultural offerings.

I spent four days exploring the museums and palaces, including Schönbrunn Palace and St. Stephen’s Cathedral. By the end, I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of art and history, but Vienna is a dream for culture lovers. The public transport system was great, and I enjoyed walking through the beautiful streets, though I wouldn’t say Vienna was as warm and inviting as some of the other places I visited.

# Prague, Czechia - 5 days

Prague was like stepping into a fairytale. The entire city felt like a time capsule, with its medieval architecture perfectly preserved. It was a much more laid-back experience compared to Vienna. I spent five days in Prague, and it felt like just the right amount of time to take in the city’s beauty.

The beer culture in Prague was one of the best parts—local pubs served some of the best beer I’ve ever had. However, I did encounter some scammers, particularly in the more tourist-heavy areas, so it’s definitely worth staying cautious. Watching the sunset from one of Prague’s parks was a magical experience and a memory I’ll cherish forever.

# Amsterdam, Netherlands - 5 days

By the time I reached Amsterdam, I was starting to feel a bit tired from all the traveling, but the city’s energy revived me. Amsterdam is a place where freedom and creativity are everywhere. The people are open-minded, non-judgmental, and the city itself is a mix of minimalistic design and vibrant culture.

Cycling through the city was a blast, and I visited the Van Gogh Museum, explored the canals, and even checked out the famous Red Light District. While the city wasn’t as clean as some of the other places I visited, its charm and open atmosphere made it an exciting and relaxing end to my trip.

# Challenges & Lessons Learned:

One of the biggest challenges I faced was when my luggage didn’t arrive with me in Paris. Waiting for eight hours at the airport was frustrating, but it taught me the importance of having essentials in my carry-on—just in case!

I also had to adapt to different cultural norms quickly, especially when it came to interacting with locals. Learning to greet people properly, using Google Translate, and being cautious in tourist-heavy areas helped me navigate the trip more smoothly.

Switzerland’s expense was another hurdle, but its efficiency and beauty made every franc spent feel worth it. On the flip side, Prague was more budget-friendly, but being mindful of potential scammers became important.

This solo trip changed me in ways I didn’t expect. It gave me a sense of independence and confidence that I hadn’t experienced before. From the cultural immersion of Vienna to the natural beauty of Switzerland, this journey was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you’re considering a solo trip across Europe, I can’t recommend it enough. Each country had its own unique charm, and I came away with a deeper appreciation for both the world and myself.

Feel free to ask me any questions that might help you plan a solo trip to any of the destinations. Cheers!

solotravel,1gb7epa,Solo travelling while dealing with loneliness?,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gb7epa/solo_travelling_while_dealing_with_loneliness/,142,"I really love travelling and I have an opportunity for a time off early next year but I have no friends to go with. I'm 24M.

I've never travelled alone, I'm afraid because I now deal with loneliness more than half the time. People say that solo travel is freeing and I couldn't really understand. Other people choose to go solo, I don't have a choice. Going out alone often feels like a constant reminder of the fact that I'm missing something everyone else has.

I'm afraid that it would feel silent. When I used to travel with friends, all my crises and problems were paused. Like a tinnitus that is only noticeable when in a quiet room, the friends were the tv and travel was the fan white noise.

Travelling abroad costs a fortune where I'm from so I have to be sure it's worth the money.

So I'm wondering if it's a good idea or if anyone has ever been in a similar position.",2024-10-24 16:54:06

My company offers a sabbatical program where they pay us to take a week off work and contribute up to $1,000 in related travel expenses. The main criteria is, *""You can select any subject for this sabbatical…as long it helps your personal growth, inspires you, contributes to your work life, or helps your team.""*

Also, I must travel solo. I'm encouraged to participate in group activities on-location, but cannot bring any friends/family with me.

I would love if all you experienced solo travelers could suggest somewhere for me to travel! I'm fairly well travelled and am expecting to exceed the $1,000 expense contribution. If it matters, I've been to Africa, most of Europe, Peru, and lots of Central America. I'm based in North Carolina, but would be looking to likely travel abroad. Nothing is too off the wall, the crazier the better.

Budget: $4,000 - $5,000

Interests: Food, Wine, Hiking, Nature, Cultural Immersion

Citizenship: American

Transportation: Tram( airport & other places ), Lothian buses but mostly on foot. Extremely walkable city.

Shoes: I contemplated two pairs of shoes but also wanted to pack the bare minimum, so my Asics gel did a fantastic job and dried up pretty fast even after rain. No discomfort / pain even averaging 30k steps each day.

Clothes : I packed layers, but sweaters and a waterproof jacket was enough. It was pleasant throughout - 55 to 60F.

Weather : it was mostly sunny, and the random rains followed by sun would always pop up the fall colors. Very picturesque.

Stayed in Dean village which was a short walk to city center.

Food and drinks: No specific recommendations. Vegetarian and a teetotaler. I loved Wee Bonnie cafe, Dishoom, Pulse plant, Kochchi and all the coffee.

Itinerary:

Day 1: airport to early check in. Explored Dean village, Princes st gardens, Scott monument, sunset at Calton Hill, James Quarter mall for dinner. Highlight of the day: *two rainbows & sunset at Calton*

Day 2: Edinburgh castle(skipped the tour), Royal mile - St Giles Cathedral, judiciary building, high court, supreme court, Writers museum, Cockburn Street, Greyfriars Bobby, University of Edinburgh and Scottish museum. Tip: visit the terrace at the museum for spectacular city views. Vennel steps for uninterrupted view of Castle, Victoria street. Favorite : *St Giles, Scottish museum*.

Day 3: Dean village, Leith walkway, Belford bridge, St Bernard's well, Stockbridge, Circus lane, Saint stephens, Botanical gardens, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen's drive for views of Arthur's seat and finally took a tour of Scottish Parliament building. Balmoral hotel. Favorites: *Circus lane, Queen's drive, Leith walkway*.

Day 4: this was the day of cyclone(!) so canceled the day trip to Glasgow. Had no solid plans. Went to the National galleries and this was a pleasant surprise. Great art collection. Could easily spend half a day here. Gardens were closed, so went around the city again as the rains stopped. Took a random tram to see Queen's yacht and then back to royal mile and checked out a lot of random streets and alleys. Winds were absolutely crazy by evening so decided to call it a day and bid farewell to this colorful joyous city. Its the bittersweet moment of every trip.

I got a lot of useful information on this sub, so paying it forward. Happy travels.

Slowly this plan has changed from just going to Greece and ""living"" there for a month to a ""well let me see more of Europe if I'm doing this"" trip. Not sure if I'm making a mistake or not with that mindset.

The trip dates are 11/29 - 12/23 and I have to work remotely (America is roughly 6-8 hours behind depending on time zone) Tuesday-Thursday during the week. Mainly wanted to avoid the super cold parts of Europe, and stay fairly low-cost. This was a potential itinerary I built up for around $3k, including flights and hotels, no food or entertainment budgeted yet:

Barcelona (11/30 - 12/7)

direct flight to Florence

Florence (12/7-12/13)

train to Rome

Rome (12/13 - 12/15)

direct flight to Athens

Athens (12/15 - 12/23)

direct flight back to Barcelona, then fly back home.

I only chose some of the more touristy cities since it's so last minute and I haven't even booked anything in the trip would be in 5 weeks.

Looking for recommendations on a Caribbean/Tropical destination for a long weekend or week long trip in November or December 2024 with a focus on beautiful beaches/sights and meeting people. I'm targeting Belize or Antigua with St. Thomas or Turks and Caicos(think too pricey) being a possible third contender. Flying out of Philly or NYC airports. Open to hearing suggestions outside of this but given it's a last minute trip, I'm looking for a flight \~$400-500.

I'm looking for beautiful beaches with fun but chill/mellow nightlife and good food. I love looking at beautiful/historic sights and I'm not much into activities like hiking or snorkeling but would enjoy a sight seeing boat trip. Would be great to find some other travelers/digital nomads or friendly locals- want to avoid an island of all couples or families. For nightlife, I loved Aruba beach bars with the ease of being able to walk everywhere and friendly locals. Also loved San Juan PR's mix of bustling old town with beaches close by. I am open to renting a car for some exploring opportunities but don't want to drive longer than an hour to get to them. I tend to stay at modest accommodations a few blocks from the beach- usually AirBnb guest house studio's (around $150/night total) but would be open to hotels if they are the right price. Not a fan of all inclusives. If accommodations are reasonable enough, I could stay longer and work remotely for a bit as well. I also considered Costa Rica but I'm a bit stressed with the short timeline and it might be a little more activity based than what I was looking for.

Any feedback on where to stay in these destinations- or any other places- might be a good fit for me?

I (23 M) am planning on taking time off work to travel solo between around January 4 to January 15. I have traveled solo a few times in Europe, and I always had a great time. My family lives in France and I have an French passport, so I want to switch things up and visit a new place on a different continent. I am thinking Guatemala with a few days in Mexico City as well. I will be flying from San Francisco and will have to end up in Boston at the end of my trip. 

I am a very social person and love to meet people at hostels. My go to is always party hostels that host events where I can meet others that are down to do anything. During the day I typically walk around or hike to explore things and at night I like to party. 

Would Guatemala be a good place to visit solo? I am looking at spending a few days in Antigua and 4-5 days at Lake Atitlan but I am open for other suggestions. I am also thinking of spending a few days in Mexico City on my way back to the states since there are direct flights. Ideally, i would spend under $1500-$2000 on the entire trip which I think is doable after looking at flights and the general low prices of Guatemala. The one thing that worries me is safety. I speak pretty good Spanish so i can get around but is crime bad?

* Not too sure what I want to do here. Maybe travel a bit more to somewhere outside of the main city? Would love to check out some of the nature and sights, but in the middle of November that will likely be difficult. 

  
I love nature, architecture, and dope views. I'm in my early 20s and am very social and enjoy clubs and bars, but am not super comfortable attending those on my own. If I click with people in the hostel, I would definitely run it up.

My main concern is food: I want to try different kinds of desserts, (real) coffee, and vegan restaurants. Not sure what restaurants or niche places I should try and check out so I would love some recommendations on places. My budget is really flexible, I want to experience as much as I can, so I don't mind spending money as long as it's worth it. Thank you all for your time! 

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS! Really appreciate the time everyone has taken to give detailed responses. Gave me some great insight into how I should manage my time and some spots I can hit.  ",2024-10-23 04:24:43
solotravel,1g9pb4v,Am I doing hostels correctly? (Need some reassurance),47,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g9pb4v/am_i_doing_hostels_correctly_need_some_reassurance/,112,"Excuse the slightly tongue-in-cheek title but I don't really know how to phrase it. 
I (38,F) am on the second leg of my world travels, starting in Europe. I'm currently into week 3 of my trip  in Italy, Germany & France. I've had a really great time and it's been just what I needed after suffering burn-out from my job.

I am ambiverted and enjoy talking to new people (but also need downtime) I've met some decent folk on my travels, however for the most part people just seem to keep to themselves. 

Excluding the party hostels I stayed at in Barcelona, more sociable hostels in Venice & Edinburgh, I would say that the vast majority of hostels I've stayed at are full of people'co-working', hiding in their bunk or on their phone all the time.

That's not a criticism, just an observation but it has made for a slightly depressing vibe for me. 
When I'm staying in a dorm I tend to come & go throughout the day, taking a breather between my planned activities, and during this time I've noticed all too often that there are other people in the dorm who barely even leave their bed let alone the hostel. Only a small fraction of the people in hostels are actually backpackers, and some don't really seem to be enjoying themselves.[EDIT: maybe I didn't articulate myself too well here, I was merely mentioning people holed-up in bed as an example of one of the things I've encountered that surprised me; not people who are hungover/tired/sick - people I've encountered for literally days at a time and they never speak to anyone, never move, never do anything. I can't believe people would think I'm up in here trying to hang out with people who are chilling out in their bed. Cringe.
It's strange to me as usually people don't have a problem saying hi, maybe having a bit of a chat and getting on with their day, like I do.
The vibe is completely different when people can't even muster the energy for that, and it's taken the edge off the experience].

I guess I'm trying to find out if other people's experiences have matched my own? Personally, a reason I came travelling eas to escape the low vibe of people back in my home country, and it seems to have followed me to some extent. Is it just me, and am I being unfair about this issue? 
I (maybe somewhat naively) thought that people staying in dorms with half a dozen or so other adults would have some level of sociability, and it's been quite jarring for me that that's not the case. Has it always been like this, or is this something else we have the pandemic to thank for?",2024-10-22 18:29:59

solotravel,1g9nexz,Trip Report: New England Road Trip,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g9nexz/trip_report_new_england_road_trip/,6,"**TLDR:** Last October (5-15) I (33 year old woman) took a road trip through New England, hitting Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. The scenery is gorgeous, both the mountains and coastline. The food is great (I ate a lot of lobster) and I already want to go back and see places I missed.

I didn't make a budget for this trip (a bad habit of mine). Nor did I record how much gas, food or souvenirs cost, but I wasn’t shaking my head in dismay at my credit card bill after. I stayed in Bed and Breakfasts for about $150-250 a night. I loved having “the New England experience” this way.

Breakfasts were typically at my stay. Most lunches were at smaller shacks or places I could get into quickly. I ate nearly all my dinners at the bar, where I chatted with patrons and the bartenders and typically got one local brew or new cocktail. My souvenirs were magnets, a bottle of gin and some small artwork.

**Thursday Oct 5-Friday Oct 6**

I drove from south of Ottawa and arrived in Stowe my first evening. On the way down, I took a  route through the islands on Lake Champlain. Here I stopped for lunch at golf course (fabulous, great beer from Kraemer & Kin) and visited the small remains of a fossilized reef. I drove though Smuggler’s Notch to arrive and would have loved to take more time in this area in the future.

I stayed at the Brass Lantern Inn, which was gorgeous, super friendly owners, and really good breakfasts. It was sort of mountain cabin inspired, which fit well with Stowe.

On my full day in Stowe I walked around the (very cute!) town and hiked up to the lookout over the town to take photographs. I took a few trails to see waterfalls and mountainside scenery. I got there just after a storm had passed though, but the scenery looked much better than the images I took.

**Saturday Oct 7**

This was a big driving day with little detours and stops along the way. I went south along Route 100 (scenic byway) and visited the Cold Hallow Cider Mill in the morning since it was raining. I was able to see several covered bridges and Moss Glen Falls (roadside). Once it cleared up a bit I happened upon an artist’s market and spent time exploring the stalls.

I stayed at the Black Swan Inn on Lake Winnipesaukee and left for Salem in the morning. I loved the classic Victorian vibe but didn’t get a chance to spend much time in the building.

**Sunday Oct 8-Monday Oct 9**

Salem was a zoo when I arrived. I drastically underestimated the number of people in the city for Spooktober. I went straight to my AirBnB in nearby Marblehead (room in a private residence). I spent the afternoon at the lighthouse, relaxing and watching the tide come in. This little break was one of my favorite afternoons.

On Monday I went into Salem and took a walking tour around the city covering the history of the port town. I also visited some of the many (many) outdoor shops out for the city’s month-long Halloween festival. I got a chance to see the Peabody, an old, well established history museum.

I left town Tuesday morning after eating at a local fisherman’s spot in Marblehead (cash only, inexpensive and delicious, a recommendation from someone the night before)

**Tuesday Oct 10**

Another long road trip day. I took Coastal Route 1, which wound through cliffs and along the ocean. I stopped at several lighthouses and took a small detour to go up to a viewpoint on the Bridge. Kennebunkport was a cute town I wanted to see more of, and I had to pass through both Portland and Rockland before reaching Camden. I didn’t get a chance to see much of Camden and would love to go on a harbor and lighthouse cruise next time.

I stayed at the Blackberry Inn, which was SO classic New England. I wish I’d been able to stay longer. In the morning I continued north to Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor

**Wednesday Oct 11-Friday Oct 13**

I stayed at Moorings Inn, which turned out to be on the far side of the island from Bar Harbor town. However, it was a ten minute drive to the Bass Harbor Lighthouse. I arrived late afternoon and sat with some lovely photographers to catch images of the sunset. I am very grateful to them for their tips.

I took a harbor tour, which I had hoped would focus on the history, wildlife, and geography of Acadia. Unfortunately, my guide was more interested in telling us which house was owned by which celebrity.

I took a day to go through the Acadia Park Loop, stopping at anything that looked interesting, including the famous Thunder Hole, taking the shore path, seeing two Pebble Beaches, and visting Jordan Pond for lunch and a hike.

I decided to take the side path halfway around the pond loop, as the sign said it was a short distance to Bubble Rock. This was a mistake. None of the signs tell you the walk is basically vertical. I made it up (somehow) and got back down (another minor miracle- I am not in shape). I finally arrived back to the Jordan Pond house just after sunset and was able to catch a great photo on my phone in the twilight.

**Saturday Oct 14**

I chose to take a different route home, passing through Quebec to visit the Dark Sky Observatory in Notre-Dame-de-Bois. I attended a presentation on the solar eclipse (that occurred April 2024). While it was entirely in French (a language I cannot speak) I still found it very enjoyable. We were able to go outside afterwards and examine the sky, including Jupiter and Saturn using the observatory telescopes. 

As to the bed and breakfast. I have never had chicken as good as what I ate at the Au Vaillantbourg. Despite my language barrier, communication wasn’t difficult. The hostess had Google Translate ready and was so kind during my visit.

**What Went Right:** Food paradise. There were so many local brews. I ate so much lobster. I typically sat at the bar- I found it more engaging and interesting, even when I didn’t chat much. The bartenders were great and I got to meet a lot of wonderful visitors to the area as well!  I loved both the scenery- both the mountains and the coast

**What Went Wrong:** I had a cold the first few days, which put a damper on things, but it had resolved by the second week. I found that I was tired of moving from place to place every night in the middle portion. I didn’t expect how busy Salem would be and

**Final Verdict**: In the future, I’d love to take a couple more trips to New England and take more time in each location. I hope to go back at least once to stay in the White Mountains of New Hampshire since I missed out this time. I love visiting the mountains and the North Atlantic.",2024-10-22 17:12:03

Then, I’ll go back as if nothing happened. 

Has any of you experienced that and has any tips for speeding up this healing process, so that I can enjoy my time off and then go back to work in a better spirit ? 

I’ve been traveling solo extensively but this time is different. I’ve never had so much time off in front of me and I’m not sure how to handle it. Especially since I’m fairly introverted and hate backpacks (but I’ll have to go there because… money). 

Cheers ! 


Edit: there are some very sound advice here, thank you all ! I’m definitely not gonna rush too much, and figure it out one day at a time. Meditation is already something I’ve tried in a past month-long trip I took and it was incredibly healing. Can’t wait to see what 4 months of it will do. I’ve scheduled 3 months in Australia and then 1 month of island hopping between Tahiti and smaller Indonesian islands. I was lucky enough to pay that with miles accumulated from business trips so that’s relieving a lot of financial burden for the rest of the trip. Relaxation, physical exercise and healthy food are definitely in the menu. Good luck to everyone going though the same thing, cheers ! ",2024-10-22 05:43:54

What I noticed was my body was hard set on the circadian body clock of my home country no matter how much rest I got. It eventually got better, but the fatigue was always there. Here is a timeline of how it felt:

- Days 1 through 6: These are your most energetic days not because your well rested from your 16 hour plane ride, but rather my body felt like it was in ‘all nighter’ mode. Each day I felt the fatigue increase more and more. So for next trip I will make sure to do the more taxing things first.

- Day 7 through 10: This was the moment where my body was like ‘another all nighter…..nope can’t do it anymore’. I would wake up feeling even more tired than the day before. I was waking up for the breakfast buffets in the morning, and even trying to increase my calorie intake to give my body more energy. But still body was tired. So for next trip I plan to make these my self care and pamper/spa days.

- Day 11 through 15: I decided that waking up for breakfast was making things worse, so I decided to wake up when I would naturally wake up and sleep when I naturally felt sleepy. And things got better in terms of the energy levels and felt less fatigue. So for next EXTENDED trip, I will make sure to decline the optional breakfast add on for my hotel, and opt in to pay per day when I actually want to eat the hotel breakfast (i ended up also being really sick of the food anyway).

- Day 16 through 22: Not as tired as before, and it feels like my body clock is slowly adapting out here. However the emotional fatigue started to hit from feeling lonely and homesick. Despite have lots of interactions at the bars, malls, and tour guide groups. Definitely not present in the mind for the last week, and sometimes contemplated going home early. For next extended solo trip ill make the time to make some phone calls home (but not too much to where I am on my phone the whole time).

There's very cheap flights to there from Lima, where I am at the moment.

I'm not that into resorts though, I like beaches for a day or two, but much prefer exploring cities, so if I went I'd definitely visit Santo Domingo, spend only limited time in Punta Cana, and then explore other parts of the country.

My budget is only about $100/day for everything excluding flights. It's not a shoestring backpacker budget, but it's not a resort budget neither, probably more a 'comfortable backpacker' budget.

My Spanish is close to fluent, level C1.

Is it truly because there are reservations? Is it because I don’t speak French (as soon as the hear the English past my “Bonjour” I can’t help but think it turns sour, but maybe that’s in my head)?

I’m really only allowed to go to college, and my part time job. If I go out with friends I have to be back at a reasonable time.

solotravel,1g8srna,Venice solo trip report (October 2024): Absolutely magical!,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g8srna/venice_solo_trip_report_october_2024_absolutely/,8,"I've always dreamed of visiting Venice and am happy to report that it was every bit as magical as I'd hoped for. I've got my share of mosquito bites and my feet are killing me, but I couldn't be happier. I've been on a solo trip for four nights and have had the time of my life. 

This is my first time in Italy and I already feel confident in saying that Venice is one of the greatest cities I've ever been to - it's going to be hard for Florence and Rome to beat it. A few tips and tricks below:

1. Is Venice touristy? You bet it is! But the wonderful thing is that it's incredibly easy to escape the tourists - you can walk alone alongside deserted canals or stumble across squares frequented by locals as long as you're not afraid of getting very lost. Despite what some people say, there are absolutely locals here and there are areas you can go where you'll pretty much only hear Italian spoken. It's only Italian Disneyland if you stick to the main arteries and most famous sites. 

2. St Mark's Square is beautiful but it was probably my least favourite part of the city, as it's total tourist Mecca. It was heaving and as soon as I got there I wanted to get out again. By contrast, my favourite experiences were almost all happy accidents in entirely different parts of the city.

3. I don't like planning or making detailed itineraries, so didn't book a single attraction in advance. This gave me maximal freedom to do things spontaneously as and when I happened across interesting places. I'm happy with my choice and am almost regretting pre-booking a few attractions in Florence and Rome. 

4. The vaporetto is a must! I got a 24 hour pass and went to Burano and Torcello, and both were well worth the excursion - the mosaics at the church in Torcello are spectacular. I also did some riding on the A line along the Grand Canal - you've got to hustle your way to the outside area if you can, as it's a wonderful way to see the city. Note that Google Maps is very poor at route planning using the vaparetto, and often told me to walk when the vaparetto would have been much more efficient. You have to use your head and figure out the best route for yourself.

5. I had expected to pay for pretty much every attraction I went to in Venice, not counting on the fact that there are dozens of free pavilions to visit for the Bienalle (!!!), which are scattered all over the city. You have to have some level of tolerance for modern art, but if you have even a passing interest you need to try at least some of them. I stumbled across all the pavilions I went to in my travels by happy accident and saw loads of incredible art - my favourite was an interactive exhibit from Azerbaijan that incorporated a video game. Other excellent pavilions were in beautiful settings - a deconsecrated church and a typically private palazzo among them.

6. I'm a huge film fan and one of my favourites is Don't Look Now, which was largely filmed in Venice. A really fun part of the trip was tracking down locations from the film in the present - it took me up little alleys and districts I wouldn't have ventured into otherwise. It's a great strategy for exploring if you're a film nerd.

7. All of the best food I had in Venice was casual - the sit down places I tried were mediocre in quality despite great reviews. Particular shout out to Baci & Pasta, which made exceptional fresh gnocchi and sauces to die for, as well as an excellent tiramisu - it was so good I went twice for the great value meal deals.

8. I strongly recommend staying in one of the more outlying districts (I stayed in the south west, near the bus station), as it encourages more exploration and will give you insights into areas you'd otherwise never venture into. 

I hope that helps to guide and inspire someone else out there! Now I've just got to hope the rest of the trip can sustain this amazing travel high.",2024-10-21 15:42:16
solotravel,1g97grx,Uzbekistan recommendations,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g97grx/uzbekistan_recommendations/,18,"Hi everyone :) 

I will be going to Uzbekistan in March (mid to late) and I'm looking at general recommendations (not only for itinerary). 

Here is my current itinerary but I haven't booked anything yet.

- day 1 : Tashkent arrival early in the morning

- day 2 : Tashkent

- day 3 : Tashkent - Samarkand (train in morning)

- day 4 : Samarkand

- day 5 : Samarkand (whole day) + Samarkand - Termez (midnight train)

- day 6 : Termez (whole day) + night train to Samarkand

- day 7 : Samarkand (maybe daytrip to Shahrisabz)

- day 8 : Samarkand (whole day) + Samarkand - Khiva (night train)

- day 9 : arrival Khiva in the morning

- day 10 : Khiva (maybe daytrip to the forteresses, probably would be with Islambek but open to suggestions)

- day 11 : Khiva

- day 12 : Khiva - Bukhara (train)

- day 13 : Bukhara

- day 14 : Bukhara

- day 15 : Bukhara - Tashkent (train)

- day 16 : Tashkent (buffer day if something happen like I miss the train because my flight is early next morning

- day 17 : fly back home

I also thought about Ferghana valley but I felt I didn't have enough time to include the whole valley and all the things I wanted to see in my itinerary so I figured I would keep it for another trip maybe when there will be more trains available, same goes for the Aral Sea, I want to see it so bad but I don't have the budget to pay for the expedition. I'm still open to other suggestions of cities to add, I could extend my stay for a few days if needed to.


Accomodations:

Even if I saw mostly bad reviews I would like to stay in Hotel Uzbekistan for my first 2 nights.

I've heard good things about Old Radio Hostel in Samarkand and Art Hostel in Tashkent but I would love recommendations (particularly for Khiva and Bukhara).

Other things I want to know :

- Which SIM card did you get (preferably available at airport) unfortunately I cannot have an e-sim with my phone.
+ how is the coverage around the country, is it only in big cities or I should be able to have internet on train rides?

- That might be really specific but I'm a photographer (with diploma) I would love to bring my film camera, is there still some labs in Tashkent that would sell film and either develop it in 1 day or could ship them to Canada when they're developed? 

- I'm collecting flags of every country I go to, is it easy to buy them and where should I go? I've had so much difficulty finding flags in Europe this summer I don't wanna go through that again

I’m currently on my first solo trip which is also my first trip to Europe. Starting tomorrow I head to Madrid and have 5 days left of a 2-week long trip. I’ve had a great time so far, minus a few hiccups, but I’m feeling exhausted and burnt out from my trip so far. I’ve packed a lot in and travelled to a lot of places and underestimated how much more tiring/stressful navigating new places on my own would be. 

Part of me wants to cancel my hostel in Madrid and go somewhere more chill so I can just lie on a beach but I know that would be logistically complicated and more $. I’m planning to lower my expectations for Madrid and only try to do 1-2 big things each day but I’m so tired I’m almost not looking forward to it and I’m dreading going back to work more tired than before I left. 

Has anyone experienced this? Any advice for how to have a chill and relaxing end to my trip? Thank you!",2024-10-21 14:46:04

I was thinking of going back to Vienna for a few days, since it’s my favorite city, but I was just there last year. I also would like to go to Poland and I was thinking Krakow, but reading online it is NOT nice there in the winter with smog. I absolutely fell in love with Eastern Europe and much prefer it to western & Mediterranean Europe so I’m looking for some ideas. My current idea is:
A few days in Tallinn, a day and a half or so in Helsinki, and then maybe a few days in Stockholm. I have Amsterdam, Brussels, and London possibly for next year so none of those and I’ve recently been to Barcelona, Lisbon, Prague, and Vienna. I’m thinking about the first to second week of December.

solotravel,1g90jpr,Chile Itinerary Feedback and Questions for November Travel ( 10/11/24 - 20/11/24),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g90jpr/chile_itinerary_feedback_and_questions_for/,2,"Howdy all -- 

I will start with my questions first. I have a ten day trip to Chile. I thought originally i had booked 12 days so I might add two days to my overall trip anyway. 

  
Questions:

* Would you recommend an extra day in San Pedro or Patagonia?
* Is it safe to travel alone as a black american woman? 
* Besides general common sense, are there any things to be particularly aware of?
* Are there any recommended cultural/historical sites that are not to be missed?
* What do you wish you had been mindful of before your trip? 
* What is something you overthought but didn't need to?
* How do you determine if a tour company is 'good' or not?
* Recommended accommodations in or near TDP that are relatively affordable (less than 200 per night and preferably way less than that)?
* What kind of luggage did you pack? (I am planning to take a suitcase but within the suitcase a bag that can be worn as a backpack if needed (not a hiking bag).
* Any special clothing needed?

  
Blurb:

I am hoping to solicit feedback about a short trip to Chile. I realize I am cramming in sites because of poor planning so I think I will extend my return how by 2 or three days.  The only flights I have booked now are to and from Chile and from Santiago to Calama. I messed up and booked one day less than I had planned. Before I pay the change fee to change my SCL-CJC flight to add one additional day, I'd like some feedback. 

*  10/11/24 - 13/11/24 - Arrive in SCL. Depart SCL to Calama. Arrive 130p. Bus to SPDA. Rest a bit and then local sites. 11/11 - 13-11 join a tour or two for parks and stargazing. Maybe an overnight camping trip If i can find one.  Departure is 18:30 on 13/11 to SCL.  I found a 3 days tour for 205.00 pesos which included Valle de la Luna, Tatio Geysers, and Altiplanic and Baltinache lagoons.  There were other one stop tours between 50 and 100 pesos. 



* 14/11 - 17/11 - SCL - PNT. This is where I need to decide if I should extend my overall trip. From all of my searching, it seems it would be good to have as many days as possible in Patagonia. Here, I wanted to take a cruise to see fjords. A trip to Balmaceda and Serrano looks to be beautiful. I'd like to do that one day. I plan to rent a car either on arrival or one day after arrival if I can schedule a cruise for day two but I think it might make more sense to rent the car, head up to TDP and stay for 3 days and back to Natales to return the car and take a cruise.  I am not a hiker so I would do short - less than 6km hikes. I need to do more research on hikes and lookout points. Looking at accommodations I can't tell if it's better to stay outside but near the entrance of the park or to stay in the park at a hostel Refugio. So far things are looking very $$$ for lodging.  



* 17/11 - 19/11 - PNT-SCL. I haven't booked this flight yet. If I extend my trip one day, I would stay in Puerto Natales an extra day and take a leisure day trip. If not, I would head back to Santiago to visit the city before my flight home at 23:00 on 19/11. I plan to spend a day in Santiago and then a day in Mapio for wine. I love cities so I do want to spend time seeing the capital including a museum and having tasty food. 

I know the weather will be cool and or windy so I will prepare layers and gear appropriately including base layers, windbreaker/rain jacket, hat, gloves, hiking boots, sweaters, jeans, tshirt, long-sleeve shirt, sunnies, and sneakers.

solotravel,1g9gadn,Fear of interacting with people as an American,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g9gadn/fear_of_interacting_with_people_as_an_american/,60,"I am a pretty solitary person in general, and I usually don't stay in hostels much, but I decided to stay in one tonight in an attempt to branch out and get to know people. However, like every previous attempt, I've ended up cowering in my cot by myself for the past few hours. It's pretty stupid, but I'm consistently terrified of what people will think about me/say to me since I am (US) American. I don't feel comfortable lying about my ethnicity and saying I'm Canadian, either (and I kind of find that behavior uncouth in general). I had actually mustered up my courage a bit earlier at the attached bar and while I was eating dinner I was openly movked (in English) by some Germans sitting right next to me about the way I eat my food. 

I recognize that plenty of people will be nice, and not every conversation will turn political, but also recognize that the following assumptions will be made about me before even conversin:

1. I am stupid

2. I am boorish

3. I am wasteful

4. I am politically deranged.

And perhaps this is quite selfish (?) of me, but these are not things I wish to counter and prove myself against while on vacation. Nor do I feel the need to prove I am ""one of the good ones"" or prove myself in general in order to make a new friend. It almost seems like it is not even worth trying to be friends with people who will always secretly think ill of me anyway. 

I recognize I have a massive chip on my shoulder here, but am I even wrong? I'm basing these assumptions/fears off of interactions I've had online + with (mostly European) coworkers who have blamed simple mistakes I've made on being a ""reckless American"" and discounted my abilties/academics. Does anyone have any advice or should I just keep on keeping to myself? ",2024-10-22 11:55:04

I am (30F) from Scotland and I am potentially going to be travelling South Africa (still at the planning stage, would like to go east coast to west coast).

I have heard though that if you have anything expensive visible (such as watches, expensive jewellery etc) then you should keep these hidden. 

Whilst I would be fine doing this in a cold country using sleeves etc, I have an Apple Watch Ultra 2 that I wouldn’t want to take off and also wouldn’t want to wear long sleeves in the heat. 

This got me thinking of alternatives, if anyone has any hints/tips or tricks to help avoid your stuff getting stolen (I seen someone with a case for their AirPods that looks like a mini Vaseline tub).

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Edit; a few people have recommended not taking things like my AW at all, which is a very reasonable suggestion. However I’ve been recommended by my heath care practitioner to keep it on as often as I can to help monitor some issues I’ve been having. 

So I’m looking for alternatives or a balance where I can get best of both worlds. ",2024-10-21 17:14:36
solotravel,1g7u4oo,A guy tried to rob me in Barcelona during my solo trip ,568,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7u4oo/a_guy_tried_to_rob_me_in_barcelona_during_my_solo/,82,"Well, basically what the title says. I’m on the midle of a solo trip around Europe, and 5 days ago a guy with moroccan accent tried to rob me in Carrer d’En Mónec and Carrer de Sant Pere Mitjá (Ciutat Vella). It was 18:30 aprox and my Airbnb was a block away. It was my last day in Barcelona and I was coming back early because I had to take a flight at 7am to Paris. The guy passed me in the alley and then turned around and started talking to me in English and Spanish at the same time while trying to shake my hand. He was probably high. I ignored him and kept walking while the guy proceeded to hug me (that's when I realized he wanted to rob me) the moment he did that I pushed him with only one hand because the other was in my pocket holding my cell phone, and I could see that I moved it with relative ease. At that moment I realized that the best thing I could do was to push him again and run. The guy started to say to me ""hey, no push, everything is ok"" (speaking between English and Spanish). He hugged me again, I pushed him again and ran away. When I started to run the guy tried to snatch my fanny pack from me, and with the other hand he pulled a chain that I had under my shirt but that he probably noticed when he hugged me. He couldn't get my fanny pack (which had my passport, some cash and cards) out of my hand and the chain broke and it fell on my hand that was holding the fanny pack tightly (it wasn't very valuable). I managed to run to the end of the alley where there were tourists (it was very close to the Catalan music palace and the Gothic quarter) and the guy luckily didn't follow me. Having to walk back to the Airbnb through the same alleys and then having to leave at 4am to go to the airport was a terrifying experience. Although I had been told that Barcelona had a security problem, I never thought it would be so serious. Being from Latin America, we also tend to downplay these warnings or think that nothing will happen because Latin America is supposed to be much more dangerous. If you travel to Barcelona, ​​be careful. Sorry for my English. ",2024-10-20 08:29:21

solotravel,1g8rdcp,Which European City to visit in Late January based on this itinerary?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g8rdcp/which_european_city_to_visit_in_late_january/,3,"I’m planning a trip in late January 2025: 3 nights skiing in the mountains of Turkey, 3 nights in Istanbul, then 3 nights in a different European city before heading back to the US. I went to Turkey a few months ago and stopped in Zurich & Lucerne on the way back. What European city would you recommend that are worth visiting in late January?

Or should I go to Muscat, Doha, or another Middle Eastern country in Late Jan?




Budget: $5,000 USD. 
My flights will come to around $1,200 on the most expensive side and $700 on the cheapest (depending which city i pick) hotels will be around $1,500-$1,750 total). Rest will be for food, tourist activities, and experiences. 

Itinerary Overview:

21st Jan:
- Fly to Istanbul

22nd Jan:
- Arrive in Istanbul
- Evening flight to Ankara
- Stay in Ankara

23rd Jan:
- Drive to ski mountains (5hr)

24th Jan:
- Ski Day 1

25th Jan:
- Ski Day 2

26th Jan:
- Ski Day 3

27th Jan:
- Morning drive to Ankara
- Flight to Istanbul (arrive by evening)
- Stay in Istanbul

28th Jan: 
- Istanbul Day 1

29th Jan:
- Istanbul Day 2

30th Jan: 
- Istanbul Day 3

31st Jan:
- Morning/Afternoon flight to a European (or Middle Eastern City)

1st Feb:
- City day 1

2nd Feb: 
- City day 2

3rd Feb:
- City day 3

4th Feb:
- Fly back to U.S.

Potential European Cities I'm considering:
- Vienna, Prague, Lisbon, Rome


Potential Middle Eastern Cities I'm considering:
- Muscat, Doha, Dubai

Research I’ve done:

* Lisbon: Milder winter weather, fewer tourists, and great for exploring historic sites like Belém Tower and Alfama. Rain is possible, but overall a good winter destination.

* Vienna: Beautiful in winter, with ice skating, coffee houses, and museums. Known for cultural charm & classical music. 	

* Prague: Beautiful in winter with its medieval architecture and potential for snow, fewer tourists and cozy cafes. 	
* Rome: Mild winter climate, fewer crowds at major attractions like the Colosseum and Vatican. January sales also make it a good time for shopping. 	
* Muscat: Warm and sunny in January, ideal for outdoor activities like exploring the Grand Mosque and coastal areas. Natural beauty and rich culture. 	

* Doha: Great winter weather, with cultural attractions like the Museum of Islamic Art & Souq Waqif. Blend of tradition and modernity. 

* Dubai: Comfortable temperatures for exploring landmarks like the Burj Khalifa and desert safaris. January is peak tourist season, so it might be busier.



I am open to suggestions/recommendations. If there is a better way of approaching this please let me know. Better way to do the itinerary, recommended city to visit in Late Jan, etc.

go next month on a solo trip in SEA but only 1-2 weeks

go to japan for 2 weeks for a more chill trip

save the money until june and go for 6 months or 1 year trip around SEA but at that time the weather isn't great

I also have two concerns for the trip. One of my main concerns is that I am going to get bored/depressed after a week or so. I can see this happening easily if I spend too much time in places such as japan where nobody speaks English. My other concern is getting robbed/pickpocketed.

solotravel,1g8ddij,Central and South America trip starting in Guatamala ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g8ddij/central_and_south_america_trip_starting_in/,10,"Hi there - I've got a five month trip coming up from 1st December and just wanted to get your thoughts on my itinerary. First month is well planned, after that I've just got a rough direction of travel. 

I'll be starting in Guatamala before heading to Belize. 

Then I'll head up to Mexico and work my way back to the Pacific/West Coast before traveling back through Guatemala to El Salvador. My plan is then to get a boat to Nicaragua (avoiding Hondurus as unfortunately UK citizens now require a visa for Hondurus) and continue working my way south into South America.

Plan:

Dec 2-6: Antigua, including doing Acatenango volcano trek
Dec 6-7: free couple days before Spanish course starts, may stay another two nights in Antigua or go to Panajachel
Dec 8-21: Staying at San Pedro La Laguna where I'll be doing a Spanish language course - have the weekend free at the moment (14/15 Dec) so open to ideas for where to go
Dec 21-23: Lanquin
Dec 23-27: Semuc Chapney
Dec 27-29: Flores (for Tikal) 
Dec 29-Jan 1: San Ignacio (Belize) 
Jan: Belize/South Mexico, and El Salvador (via Guatemala Pacific Coast) 
Feb: Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panamá
Mar: Colombia*, Ecuador* and Perú*
Apr: Bolivia, Chile and Argentina

*Have visited before so will be quick through these countries, visiting some of the places I've not seen before on my previous trip or wanting to revisit. 

Main questions:

- Am I missing out on anything major in Guatamala from the plans above? 

- Do those rough timings seem appropriate for the later countries in my list (Jan onwards)? 

Any advice or thoughts welcome!

* Day 23: Spend in Guangzhou

**Shanghai** - Day 24-25 (Jan 8 - 9): Travel back to Shanghai by train Jan 8 (day 24) for returning flight on Jan 9 (day 25)

 

Currently I plan to take flights for the longest journeys, (Shanghai - Chengdu and Chongqing - Hong Kong) and train for the rest. Does this seem reasonable? Any suggestions for sites where I can compare and book domestic flights and trains, trip.com?

**Note:** The reason why I put Hong Kong before Guangzhou/Shenzhen is because I would like to visit Hong Kong while there are still Christmas decorations up and for new year's eve, as these are more celebrated in Hong Kong but not mainland China - but please correct me if I am wrong about this.

Thankful for any thoughts or input!",2024-10-20 17:29:42
solotravel,1g7udc3,Bali as an older traveller ,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7udc3/bali_as_an_older_traveller/,28,"(Resubmitting as instructed)

I'm an older man (early 60s) and mostly travel alone. I hear some of my younger workmates say how much they have enjoyed Bali, but I think they mostly travel in groups of friends or as couples.

I'd probably go for a week or so, as part of a longer holiday in the region.  Budget is fairly flexible; I definitely don't want to be staying in hostels, but don't particularly need to stay in luxury hotels.  I'm guessing I'd be comfortable spending around IDR 20 million just for accommodation, and 50-100% of that again for things to do, if they justified the price.

My normal travelling interests are towns and museums, so this would very much be a jump away from habits.

Any views on whether an older man travelling solo would get much out of Bali?",2024-10-20 08:47:54

I’m setting off in early January 2025 on a one-way trip to Guatemala City with a backpack, some curiosity, and £7,000 to stretch over 5 to 6 months. 


Deets:

Depart: Early January 2025 (Flight to Guatemala City)

Countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Peru 

Return: May/June 2025.

Budget: £7,000 ($9,135)


I’m hoping to make the most of my budget – sticking to hostels, cheap eats, and buses where I can. I’ve got some places in mind, but I’d love to hear about hidden gems, cool off-the-beaten-path spots, or tips to make my cash last longer. Speaking of which, should i carry cash?

Hoping to make the first few weeks really about relaxing. A nice beach and some sun is mainly what I need.

After that…

…I’m all about the experiences. Think hiking, local markets, street food, meeting interesting people, parties too. I’d also be open to volunteering or working in exchange for food and a bed (if money gets tight). Basically, I’m trying to get the most out of this trip without breaking the bank.

One thing that I am conscious of is I might need to get a flight from a central American country to Columbia as the Panama border is apparently sketch.

So, hit me up with any advice! Whether it’s the best hostels, cheap travel tips, must-see places, or how to make the most of a limited budget. Anything that could help stretch my £7,000 budget would be amazing as I’m concerned it’s not enough.

Thanks in advance, and I’m looking forward to your recommendations

solotravel,1g7oagd,Parents upset about me solo traveling. ,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7oagd/parents_upset_about_me_solo_traveling/,114,"
Hello I am a 19F Jamaican American and i’m planning on visiting Europe (Paris, Rome, Cologne, & Barcelona) this December. This won’t be my first time solo traveling, but this will be my first time traveling outside the country solo.

My parents are extremely angered by my plans. No matter how much I try to reassure them, they say I don’t listen and don’t know anything.

They say things like “anything can happen” “you are just a 19 year old child you don’t know anything about life” “what if you get sick” “there’s no way for us to contact you if something happens” “you don’t know the kind of people there” etc.

My mom even said “all you wanna do now is spend your money on traveling maybe you need to start paying more rent.”

I then overheard them in their room discussing getting a family member to call/come over and speak to me to convince me not to go. 

Honestly i’m more scared for them than myself. They also said I shouldn’t be doing this to them because they won’t be able to sleep and they’ll have to be fasting the entire time. This same thing happened when I went to miami solo and nothing happened. I’m not saying solo travel is the safest thing ever, but my parents don’t care about statistics of the likelihood of things happening. To them, the .00001% chance is still a major risk. 

I’m still trying to keep myself together and reassure myself that I know I will be okay but I hate seeing my parents so worried. Their anxiety and paranoia is carrying on to me and I just want to enjoy my trip. 

There’s a plethora of safety precautions I plan to take such as sharing my location with them, checking in with them everyday, staying in the city areas with good reviews, watching videos on safety, watching solo travel videos in these areas, bags to avoid pickpockets, esims, best transportation options, etc. I’m not going into this trip naive. But they couldn’t care less if this place had 0 crimes. To them it would still be unsafe for me because i’m a young girl alone. 

Edit: Thank you so much for your traveling tips and advice on dealing with my parents🥹 I ended up making a powerpoint that went over all my plans regarding their concerns. I used some of your guys tips on what to say to them and my dad actually said i made a good point! Although they still are not necessarily happy about me going alone, I can tell the powerpoint definitely eased their worries a little. We had a long discussion and they offered for me to cancel the trip for now and allow them to come with me next year. I told them that we can always go together in the future but for now I’d like to continue with my plans and enjoy my time solo. The last thing they said to me is that they can’t do anything about my decision but they’re just glad i’m putting in the effort to be responsible. ",2024-10-20 01:54:38

solotravel,1g7ghrn,***TRIP REPORT*** 4-Day Weekend in Berlin ,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g7ghrn/trip_report_4day_weekend_in_berlin/,13,"I'm an American solo traveler (47M) and I was looking for a fun destination for my birthday weekend. I saw Berlin was celebrating its ""Festival of Lights"" this month, so I decided to visit over Columbus Day weekend. Here's my trip report!

**Lodging:** St Christopher's Inn Alexanderplatz. This is a hostel. I don't mind hostels, but at my age I'm becoming more and more aware of the age difference between myself and the average demographic. Maybe I'm self conscious, but my love for hostels is becoming awkward as each year goes by.

***(DAY ONE – Arrival in Berlin, Friday 11 OCT @ 1010***  *– (Depart Venice Marco Polo at 0830)*

Because I was arriving early, I'd planned to take a boat ride on the Spree River to kill time before checking into the hostel. But there was some government event that weekend, so all the boats were canceled. I ended up going to Museum Island and seeing the Pergamon Panorama (which was awesome) and the Neues Museum exhibit with Nefertitti's Mask and a cool golden hat.

I ended up just exploring until 1500 which was the hostel check-in time, but when I finally went there at 1502 there was a huge queue of other people checking in and it took more than an hour to get my room key.

That night I checked out the Festival of Lights, which is a pretty cool event where they light up all the monuments around Berlin with a digital light show, and everyone is out and about, drinking and watching the lights. 

***(DAY TWO – Saturday 12 OCT)***

Hostel Breakfast then Berlin Free Walking Tour at 1000 – It ended up being a 3-hour tour, but the guide was great and we hit most of the main sites in Berlin. I usually book these ""free"" tours to see new cities. This one was good so I tipped 20 euro.

I always research my travel destinations, and for Berlin one of the ""must-see"" experiences was a tour of the Bundestag Dome. I did the tour at 1330, and it was definitely worth it. And free!

I did lunch at a random restaurant and had fries and pork schnitzel and a beer for about 17 euro. 

A bartender at the hostel recommended a good way to see the Festival Of Lights, so I ended up walking from **Brandenburg Gate** to **Potsdamer Platz** to **Bebelplatz** to **Berlin Cathedral** to **Museum Island** to **St. Mary’s Church** to TV Tower, then back to the hostel. At this point I'd had about 20,000 steps for the day, so I had a beer at Belushi's, the hostel bar then went to sleep around 2300.

***(DAY THREE – Sunday 13 OCT)*** 

This was my birthday, so I ended up doing a speed-run of places I'd researched that give free admission for birthdays. 

Little Big City - I was there right when they opened at 1000, but it was kind of lame. I was there maybe 20 minutes max, then left. 

Next I went to Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum. Free for my birthday. I've never been to one of these before. It was meh. Glad it was free.

Berlin Dungeon - I did the 1430 English show. Free for my birthday. Yes, this was a tourist attraction, and it was basically a live action haunted house - but I enjoyed it. They even gave me a free memento photo. 

It started raining, so I went to Starbucks to get a free birthday coffee. They told me I needed to download an app, but when I downloaded the app it said I had to do it 7 days before redeeming the free drink, but they were cool and gave me a free venti coffee without the app. Score!

**(*****DAY FOUR*** **–** ***Monday 14 OCT*** – My flight back to Italy was at 1320 **,** so I basically did breakfast at the hostel then took an Uber to the airport. 

Final Thoughts - Berlin was fun. The younger people at the hostel did the club scene at night, but I didn't join. I enjoyed drinking beers at the hostel bar while they pre-partied, and when they left for debauchery, I went to bed. I didn't get any grief for being ""old"", and I met cool people from a lot of different countries at the hostel. ",2024-10-19 19:22:09

solotravel,1g6x84y,I need lots of tips for my first solo travel as an 18F (I was thinking about Japan),14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g6x84y/i_need_lots_of_tips_for_my_first_solo_travel_as/,39,"Hi! I am currently 17 years old but I really want to go on my first solo trip once I turn 18 next year. I was thinking of going to Japan as I know most people say it is a solo travellers dream. I have a budget of approximately 2500$ for food, accommodations and activities. I don’t go clubbing or anything like that and while I wouldn’t mind making friends along the way, I really don’t mind being alone the entire time. I was thinking of going for approximately 18 days.

Do you have any recommendations of places I should visit? I’ve been thinking of doing the classic Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka but I would still have a good five days loose on my itinerary. I was thinking of Hiroshima and maybe Okayama but I don’t know if there is another place worth looking into. I would probably want a more tranquil city actually. Another option I thought about was going to Seoul (Korea). But I know it is not as great as Japan for solo travellers (at least for restaurants), also I am technically underage there I believe? So I don’t know whether I would be able to book a hostel and have the same liberties I would in Japan, so maybe I should stay in Japan the entire trip and not do both countries. I can already read Hangul and understand basic words and sentences though so I might be to a better advantage there. 

For accommodations I was mostly looking into capsule hotels that are exclusive to women or have locked floors for each gender. I don’t have a big budget so instead of going into a more sketchy hotel I prefer going to a good hostel. If you have any recommendations for Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka please feel free to tell me.

I was kinda worried about public transport as where I live, in Canada, there isn’t a lot of people and I’ve only taken the bus here and the metro in certain European cities. I know train is kind of the main transportation in Japan and I don’t mind but I was worried whether I would get lost easily. Do you have any tips on how to navigate well there? Moreover, for my travel in between cities, should I go by plane or train? I’ve found that certain plane tickets were cheaper than taking the train but at the same time there might be inconveniences I am not aware of?

Finally, be honest with my budget, my age and everything I’ve mentioned prior, do you think this trip is doable? I don’t speak Japanese but I am eager to learn how to read and have basic “travel” related conversation skills. Please feel free to give comments, recommendations and opinions on what I’ve mentioned prior, it surely will help me!

PS: I could go higher in my budget but I am trying to keep it the lowest I can, is it reasonable or am I in complete denial?

[edit: I want to thank everyone for their tips but I also wanted to remind some that 2500$ excludes my flights and transportation between cities (I live in Canada so I would be doomed already). Also, don’t mind recommendations when it comes to length according to my budget. I was going for 18 days because it’s the duration which I can find the best flight deals right now (for the dates I’m looking for)]",2024-10-19 00:46:34

It's a ""theme cruise"" with a focus on current events and policy. Well this year I have the resources to do it, but I'm having trouble making the commitment to doing it.

I developed a travel phobia after a trip to Italy a decade ago soon after my husband died had many things go wrong. I haven't traveled anywhere that wasn't related to work or visiting since. I feel it's something I need to get over, and I figured a cruise of like-minded people might be the way to go. 

It's a Caribbean cruise, and honestly I'm not all that interested in the whole Caribbean thing, having done it at least 20 times while my husband was alive. For me it's about relaxing, doing something different, and hopefully chatting with interesting people. The special activities include seminars, moderated panel sessions, cocktail parties with interaction with the guest speakers (mostly pundits and journalists), and dining with fellow attendees. 

It seems to attract an older crowd, which also appeals. But I still find the idea of going solo to be so daunting, and triggering all my old high school anxieties.

Fyi, I am going to Colombia early next year for 2 weeks, albeit a different country but visiting places like the ruins I could maybe do there rather than overexert myself in Guatemala.

I'm having a bit of trouble deciding a plan for my next solo trip and would appreciate some advice!

For some background info... I am a 19F student based in Boston, MA. I have solo traveled (while living in Europe) to Copenhagen, Malmo, Edinburgh, London, Budapest, Prague, Vienna, Rome, and Barcelona, for mostly short periods of time. I have also recently traveled to PR and Montreal with family. I am now planning a weekish-long trip for the middle of March. Travel priorities: FOOD!, safety as a POC and woman, beautiful sights, extensive local businesses I can support, decent weather, and relative affordability.

For this upcoming trip, I'm hoping for a new experience, so probably beyond the traditional Europe spots. I have been looking at flights and possible locations and I think I've narrowed it down to a few (Guatemala, Argentina, Iceland, or Portugal). The only thing is that I am not someone who necessarily enjoys outdoorsy things, though I would be open to it. I'm worried that there wouldn't be enough to do without partaking in activities like hiking or trail walking. I am also quite apprehensive about driving in another country so I'm not sure how that would work out.

I for sure want to go somewhere international and my budget for the entire trip is about $1,000. Hoping not to spend more than $500 on flights which pretty much rules out anything in Asia 😭 and I probably won't do multiple countries this time. I promise I have done extensive research but I'm more indecisive than ever now.

General itinerary for trips I take solo (ofc I don't follow this exactly, just adding for mods :):

Day 1 - General Sightseeing

Day 2 - Food Tour/Cooking Class

Day 3 - Booked activity/tour

Day 4 - Museums/Shopping @ local businesses 

Day 5 - Final must-see's and lots of eating!

So to my questions... should I go to one of these places or is there another spot that might be better? What has been your favorite location for a short and affordable trip? Are there any countries in these regions I should avoid? All advice and suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance!

Also, unrelated but does anyone have a good website/mailing list for flight deals specifically from Boston that don't just have the same locations every time like Athens and Barcelona?",2024-10-18 19:40:52

The first couple of days is crammed, so I'm hoping my flights will be on time. Does anyone also know the best way to coordinate transportion in Flores?

I'm going to Borneo next week on tuesday the 22nd of Oct, I want to stay for about 10-14 days but that depends on the prices of the tours and accommodation. 

I've found some tours online with prices of about $300 for 3d2n on the Kinabantangan river, and for about $600 also for 3d2n in the Danum Valley.

This feels pricey so I'm wondering if I might be better off booking the tours on location rather than online, does anyone know if this would save me money?

Does anyone have any other suggestions on affordable tours to do on Malaysian Borneo?

I've also heard people say that the Indonesian side is cheaper but less organized etc. I wouldn't mind that if it means I can save a bit of money and still experience some amazing wildlife and nature. Anyone who has some experience doing jungle tours/trekking on Indonesian Borneo and can point me in the right direction?

I would greatly appreciate any help and guidance!

I stayed in the downtown area and it was easy access to everything, I did a bunch of things there like museums, botanical garden which was amazing , walked around in the downtown area, had fun convos with a bunch of people, visited old Montreal which was beautiful, visited a bunch of restaurants, did a little souvenir shopping :) I ended up having such a great time!

Day 13-14: 29-30/12

Day 15: 31/12

* Shibuya and Harajuku for shopping and visit the biggest Animate store in Ikebukuro.
* I'm considering going to Countdown 24/25. It would be great if someone could provide some insight on that.

Day 16: 1/1

Questions

* For a first-time snowboarder, is snowboarding for 5 days a week considered a challenge?
* Is there a luggage service in Nakano? I really don't want to bring my luggage to the Monkey Park, and honestly, I couldn't find any options during my Google search.
* I am only bringing one piece of luggage, but my airline ticket allows me to bring one extra piece back for free. Therefore, I would like to buy a disposable cardboard box in Japan to pack my items. Does anyone know where I can find one?
* Is TeamLab worth visiting or not?
* Is it worth attending both days of Comiket in December? Is it better to go in the morning or the afternoon?
* Is Countdown 24/25 worth attending? Also, how difficult is it to get a ticket for a foreigner?
* Feel free to recommend some of your favourite bars near Yuzawa, Nosawa and Tokyo.

Budget is roughly 10k AUD- 7K USD

Land in UK around 20th July- don't have a date return, but leaning towards 4-5 weeks.

UK, have a car, and accommodation.



Don't have much interest in Western Europe, other than the wedding. What I'm thinking as a quick brain storm is. UK > Netherlands (Amsterdam)> Germany (Berlin)> Poland (Krakow, Warsaw)> Czech (Prague)> UK  > Australia. 



As I expect,  these flights could become quite expensive,  so thinking, other modes if transport- busses/trains ect...


Have always had an interest to see ww2 history, so  Poland and Germany a must if go.  

Will be looking into hostels and what not to try to keep the funds down, though regardless , expect a pinch. 

Advice, and I'm wondering if plausible, and if so I'll work out how long in each city. Or  am I trying to cramp too much in?

I’m travelling solo across Indonesia (32/F/UK). Currently in Amed (Bali) getting my scuba AOW, but planning on flying over to Flores on the 20th. I’ll have 6 days to explore the island before I join a Komodo diving Liveaboard on the 26th and I really like the idea of renting a scooter and working my way across to Labuan Bajo overland :)

Research tells me that starting in Maumere is the done thing, but I can only find flights to Ende in October & I’m struggling to find a scooter rental place that accommodates a drop off in Labuan Bajo.

I was wondering if anyone’s done a similar trip & has any advice on what I should do…?

Contacts for reliable scooter rental places that fit my purposes?
Tips on where I should visit during the 6 days?
Places to stay, visit, things to do, etc! 
Also if there are other solo travellers who’ll be in Flores during this time period & fancy meeting up, please drop me a line!

P.S. I have an international motorbike driving licence. In terms of interests, I love hiking, nature & other outdoor activities. I’d also love to visit some local villages and have a more immersive experience, so I’m up for booking tours in some locations - I just like the idea of doing things in my own timeframe rather than having a fixed itinerary with a driver!

solotravel,1g4n8c1,What is the ideal solo travel experience to you?,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g4n8c1/what_is_the_ideal_solo_travel_experience_to_you/,52,"**Context:** 23M budget solo travelling around the world right now, now in the middle of my 1st Europe solo travel!

As solo travelers, I find that our pace is alot faster than group travels, and the experience is built around the interactions we have with others, as well as having the leisure and freedom to do whatever we want and at whatever pace we want.

**Personal Experience** *(can ignore if you are lazy to read):* Because of this, I find that my solo travel plans mostly consist of going to the biggest cities/capitals of whatever country, seeing their most famous sights, taking a few pictures, trying some local foods, then being done with the city in the maximum of 3 days. I do not enter every single attraction, but only carefully choose those I am interested to pay the entry fee to see. Else, I would just take a look outside/around the attraction and leave. As a non-drinker, I am not really interested to visit bars, and also having no interest in cafes, I don't visit them either. Thus, I can basically ""finish"" even big cities in the span of 2 days.

**Question:** Having done these for over 10+ countries in Europe currently, I feel that there is something missing from the experience. Sure, I have been to these cities and seen/experienced these sights with my own eyes, but I did not really feel like I have truly experienced the country (or like the culture etc.) I'm not sure whether it's a me thing to think this way? Something just feels like its missing.

I have thought maybe to truly immerse in the country's culture, we would have to interact with locals, hang with them, get them to bring us around - which involves alot of time in 1 city, and that is unsustainable for budget travelers... Or maybe visiting other smaller cities other than the capital, and this again takes up time & $, not suitable for budget travelers as transport to these smaller cities often are more expensive being less popular routes.

So, any thoughts on this? What do you think one should do in a country to make it more fulfilling? Are simply seeing major sights in the capital cities sufficient to say that we have truly experienced the country? (especially in the context of Europe right now being where I am at) Would really like to hear everyone's thoughts!



*TLDR: How to make the solo travel experience more fulfilling? (Other than just taking pictures of famous sights & leaving)*

i'm currently on Lombok island, in indonesia now, been here about 10 days and it's great, but want to experience other islands and parts of the country before i fly out on dec 6 (so about 50 days from now). I leave from Bali Denpasar airport. I have a good idea of what i'd like to see (Flores/Komodo/Sulawesi/ Yogyakarta/some of Bali) and trying to figure out the best action plan via buses, ferries, flights.

Looking to do some diving as i've heard it's incredible here, though not sure how easy it is to reach places like Raja Ampat and what the price point is there. Not a huge partier but do enjoy socializing. Not a huge surfer but love to swim and snorkel. Hiked Rinjani already so wouldn't say hiking another volcano is high on my list, just enjoy the culture and see more of the country.


very rough schedule ideas ~ 

**Day 0-5**: still in Lombok and might head to Gili Trawangan

**Day 6-15 ish**: head east → to stay in Sumbawa a few days or direct to Flores (fly or boat from Lombok?)

- Diving: either north Flores or a Komodo diving trip- i've heard about [Uber Scuba Liveaboards](https://uberscubakomodo.com/liveaboard/) from a friend, or look into getting on a boat to Wakatobi to dive
- ***need to extend my 30 days visa around this time (immigration office?)

**Day 16-30 ish**: head north to Sulawesi 

- maybe Sulawesi an easier jump off point for Wakatobi diving?
- in south, visit Tana Toraja
- head north (bus?) and visit Bunaken, diving
- Raja Ampat could follow (how expensive?)
- Banda Islands, Halmahera, West Papua are options. are there places to stay? easy boats? if anyone has been

**Day 31**: fly or ferry transit from Sulawesi to Java: Yogyakarta or Surabaya ???

**Day 32-40**: Yogyakarta and Malang areas

**Day 40** - fly or ferry to Bali for my flight
- try my best to avoid high traffic areas
- stick to west and north, for example Amed town for diving
- Nusa Penida seems very touristy, maybe expensive

**Day 51** - flight out from DPS airport

for those of you who have been here and done similar, how would you recommend tackling this? any ideas on easiest /cheapest transits, and which dive sites are most worthwhile?

- Join a group tour to cover East Java: 2-3 days guided hiking / volcano tours / etc (I've found a few that look good, but if anyone has done one and has recommendations, would love to hear!)

I thought I had the balance right, around 2.5 weeks travelling on my own and 1.5 with a friend.

At first it was great with my friend. Chilled, relaxed, fun. But then she got really prickly. It was clear that our pace of travel was very different. I was up and ready to go by about 8.30, wanting to beat the hottest time of the day. I do heaps of walking, averaging at least 10+ kms a day (which is a lot, but I know plenty of people do more). I do  research about each place so I have a vague idea of things I want to see or areas to explore. For meals I would typically have a simple breakfast that I make myself, lunch would vary and often be something quick and on the go. Dinner I like a mix of eating out, take out or a supermarket meal I'll put together. I love trying local food.

My friend on the other hand, was a late riser, would prefer to spend nights in our shared accommodation watching netflix, rarely wanted to eat out and wasn't really well researched so it was always me coming up with ideas. 

We managed our shared cost on the app Split Wise. I found she often wasn't very forthcoming in paying for her fair share, so by the end she owed me a bit of money. 

We never had a fight but she got so grumpy with me. She didn't seem to want to walk anywhere. She was really moody all the time, often just going in her room at night and not saying anything. One day in the middle of our holiday I said I needed a solo day and we'd catch up that night. I wanted to do a bit of walking and knew she wouldn't be up for it, plus by then we'd spent 7 days together so I needed a break. This was something we'd discussed at home so I didn't see an issue.

After that she went from *sometimes* wanting to do things to *never* wanting to do things. On our last night together I suggested we go out for dinner, she said no, she needed to pack for her flights the next day. So I go out solo and when I get back she's in her pj's by 8 and watching netflix. 

It's been 2 weeks and we usually chat all the time (pretty much daily) and I haven't heard from her once. I contacted her a week ago and she was pleasant enough but nothing since then. 

I'm sure there were things about me that grated her, but not enough to end a friendship. We both love travel and are in a similar position financially and I was really hoping we could do more trips togehter, but after this experience I'm not even sure our friendship will survive.

I received a message from the host requesting a lot of money for the bedbugs but I have fresh bite marks to prove it just started happening. I assume he will say as I didn't mention it earlier I didn't know I had it but I haven't being getting bitten at home.

solotravel,1g4f71h,Solo travel Italy,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g4f71h/solo_travel_italy/,1,"
While I loved my time in Italy there are many things I would do differently next time.

I must mention that people suggested I visit the South during my travels through Europe, without much planning I decided to give it a go.

Important things to consider:

While the train and bus system works well as most of Europe, I found the train system in Italy to be quite confusing as there are different companies who operate trains depending on your destination- I ended up having to buy a second set of tickets after my initial train was cancelled.

I found very few people who were able to assist me with directions in English, which can be quite stressful as some of the digital sign boards on the train don’t always work.

Best to do a bit of research and understand how to get around before going in blindly as I done. Taxis are very expensive in comparison to public transport, I found Uber & Bolt doesn’t work in most places in the South.

Instead of eating out all the time and being charged tourist tax/cover charge.. better to buy take away pizza or panini and enjoy it in the park or at home etc.

Because of the large amount of tourists most places charge ridiculous prices for beer.. shop around and you will find places that cost up to 20 times less!

I found the grocery shops to be the best.

Plan a group tour of sorts early on as this gives you a good idea of interesting places to see and a great opportunity to network and ask questions.

Don’t take offence when met by a rude bus rider/ ticket officer etc. They have to deal with a lot of people.

Stay at a hostel or try go to their events to meet up with other tourists who might speak your language.

Do some research/youtube videos on the history of the area and places of interest/delicacies.


Must do: Boat ride, (avoid Capri cable cart) , hire a scooter and explore Positano & Almafi. 

Things I would’ve done if I had more time: Cultural experience ie: Museums 
Olive oil / Wine tastings
Pompeii
Diving/snorkling/fishing
Cooking class!

solotravel,1g45z0l,first solo travel,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g45z0l/first_solo_travel/,35,"I’m 18 and on my first solo travel trip from the USA to Italy. I had extremely high hopes and was so excited to be independent doing accommodation stay through worldpackers. I am emotionally grown up and have traveled to big cities in the USA with just friends before so I was exited for this new chapter. To say the least all i have done since the minute I got here is cry. I know little to no Italian (which I know is my fault) but to be completely fair I only got approved and found out about this a month ago. I landed in the airport in Italy after a 17 hour travel day and broke down. I had no clue what I was doing or where to go to get to the bus, to then get to the metro. I got myself to the metro and nearly cried again because everything is in Italian and i felt like a complete idiot who hadn’t slept or ate in hours. Also not to mention my sim card wasn’t working and without public wifi I still have no service out in public. So i couldn’t look up directions or call the host I was staying with. I finally got my way to the house showered and slept. I woke up and cried some more, then when it was time to go to bed I cried the entire night, from 9 PM to 6 AM. And I’m not exaggerating. It was to the point where I was getting physical symptoms of being sick; hot and cold flashes, headache, felt like I was going to vomit. I was messaging my mom all night and she tried her best to assure me that I am safe and everything will be okay, and that I am probably exhausted, jet lagged, culture shocked, and adjusting. Today has been a little bit better but I just don’t feel like myself. I randomly burst into tears (right now as im writing this). I feel so stupid for being so upset when traveling is my biggest dream yet all I want is to go home. I wish I was enjoying myself. I just feel like a failure and want to book a flight back home. It’s only day 2. Does this feeling go away? Will I adjust? Does the pit in your stomach when you think of home ever settle down? I have barely eaten since I got here because I am so anxious. I just wish i could fully enjoy my time. 😢

UPDATE- 
thank you all sooooo much for your kind words and advice! Especially since most of you are older and/or wiser than me when it comes to traveling. I am trying to get out of my own head and let myself experience this opportunity. Also trying to tell myself that the mom’s way of communicating to me may just be a cultural thing + language barrier. And if not I shouldn’t let that alter my experience let alone ruin it. I went to the city center of Milan yesterday, and was a little sad at first, being at the Duomo by myself, knowing the people i love can’t see it with me, watching everyone else be with their family and friends, it kind of stung. But the less I focused on the negative, the more I could truly take in the beauty of the city and architecture (side note: once i stopped focusing on how lonely I felt, it seemed like more and more people were popping up that were by themselves, which made me feel better). Once I got out of the busier part of the city I found myself on the most beautiful backroads I had ever seen. I also got my phone to work which definitely makes me feel a lot better. I realized it’s okay to not want to travel alone in the future, but I also have so much to learn about myself and nothing but time. Albert Einstein said “no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it” And I’ve been resonating with that a ton. ",2024-10-15 12:01:21

I’m going to Turkey for a week in February, with the main focus being Istanbul. I’ll have 7 full days excluding travel days, I’m thinking I should spend 4-5 of those in Istanbul. Not sure if it’s worth flying somewhere for the other two? Or just using buses/trains to visit another city? I know the recommendation would usually be Cappadocia but I’m hesitant to visit as I doubt the balloons will fly at that time of year. Is it still worth visiting Cappadocia? Or would you recommend somewhere else?   
  
Im mainly interested in history, food, culture and architecture. I’ll be staying in hostels.   
  
I’m also wondering if I was too fly whether it makes more sense to:

Fly in/5days in Istanbul/fly to second city/fly home from second city.

* Want to be in nature AND/OR water as much as possible, but given traveling solo, I want to socialize and enjoy the nightlife too

**Questions:**

* Should I head north or south of Brisbane - given have heard of stinger and heavy holiday crowds in those places. What places should I go to as a solo traveler? Byron? Gold coast? Airlie/Hamilton beach?

For Melbourne leg - Great ocean road trip? Can I stay somewhere in between and do it over 2-3 days?

For Sydney Leg - north or south of Sydney? What places?

solotravel,1g42ii5,solo or with my adult kids,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g42ii5/solo_or_with_my_adult_kids/,18,"I have the opportunity to take a 3 week (more or less) trip to Croatia and nearby countries next summer. This is a trip that's been put off and my husband and I both agree that I really deserve it and should do it (won't get into those reasons, but it comes after incredibly difficult life circumstances of late). I'm fortunate to have the funds. Great! That was settled. So then, when I was in a generous mood, I asked him if he'd want to join for the last week plus add on a few days for about 10 days total together. It would mean I'd have to change the trip some to cut down on locations and add a few that I wasn't as excited about to do more what he'd want to do. This is not a location he cares much about like I do, and there are several reasons why we don't travel well together on multiple location active types of trips. We both realize this, and now I'm hoping he'll decline to go. He has indicated that he might prefer to stay home and go somewhere else with me later that's on his wishlist. 

The next part is, I enjoy traveling with my adult children. My daughter and I have talked about how we are very aligned in travel styles, and as long as we eat at regular intervals, we do really great together. I actually love having her company when exploring. I'm so torn now... I keep watching videos and reading articles and posts about women solo traveling and I have developed a deep longing for it and strongly hope I can do a lot more of it to explore the world at my own pace. So far, I recently had a one week trip alone that was awesome and made me excited for more. 

Then again, my kids are currently free to go with me. It'd either be the three of us (a different dynamic though for sure, not the one-on-one bonding time), or we could be together for 2 weeks and I do one week solo.  Or I might stagger their time so that I have alone time with C1 first week, all 3 together second week, and alone with C2 third week (I know, sounds complicated and then I have more logistics to plan). Thoughts??

 I don't know how much longer they'll be available and willing to travel with me, and once they're married or have kids or have full time jobs, this might not happen again. So, partly I feel that I would regret going alone and missing the opportunity to spend with them. I would have to compromise somewhat if they come, according to preferences, moods, whatever comes up... but since I'd be paying for their trip and they're both pretty easy going with going along with my plans, and I also know them so well and try to choose activities in which we have a shared interest, it should be fine. 

Those who are married (or in long term serious relationship) and/or have grown kids, how do you decide when to go solo vs with partner or kids? What is your ratio of solo travel vs. family?  If you have adult kids, do you like travel with them and would you prefer that or solo? 

I hope to decide very soon! ",2024-10-15 07:53:08

solotravel,1g3juby,Solo Travel  - making social travel better,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3juby/solo_travel_making_social_travel_better/,4,"I've been doing solo travel two interesting ways, which are working really well for me, actually enhancing my travel with other people.

First, I've been extending trips.  I go some place with my wife and family, but then they go home and I stay a little longer - 2 days to 2 weeks extra.  This works really well for us.  I like traveling more than they do, so I get to travel more.  In addition, I find I'm more relaxed on the trips - I know I'm going to get to see what I want, and I can tell them honestly ""Let's do what you want, don't worry about what I want, if I miss something I like, I'll do it when you leave.""  Sometimes I stay a couple of days extra in the same place, sometimes I fly or drive to some other nearby place, or a combination.  Costwise, it works pretty well - airfare is usually the most expensive part of a trip, and that doesn't increase much if at all.  Rental cars sometimes are ""free"" because often a 5 day rental costs the same as a week.  Hotels are the largest added expense.

Second, I've been scouting places on my own, then going back with other people, typically 2-4 years later, e.g. my wife or my parents.  If i really like a place, I like showing it to other people, and it's easier and less stressful if I've been there before.  Sometimes when I do the trip planning and it's my first time, I screw something up and go some place disappointing, or have trouble navigating, etc.  But the second time is usually easier and smoother, and makes my trips with other people better.

  
There's a tendency to think of Solo travel as something antisocial, but it's nice to know there are ways it can work really well to make social travel even better.  (And of course, there's nothing wrong with solo travel - often I go some place completely on my own, just because I do enjoy solo travel and the complete freedom that it brings.)",2024-10-14 16:23:07

solotravel,1g3jxo5,South America Itinerary (January-March),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3jxo5/south_america_itinerary_januarymarch/,8,"I am currently planning a trip in South America for early next year. This will be my first trip to South America. I will have about 3 months from early January - end of March/early April. I’m aware this isn’t enough time to see everything, but I’m hoping to make the most of it. I’d like to visit Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina (I know I’m skipping some good countries - hopefully I’ll return again and visit more). 

I’m looking for some recommendations on an itinerary. There are some key places that I’d like to visit, but looking to hear from others who have traveled there. A trip into the amazon is at the top of my list - maybe in Peru or Ecuador. I also really want to spend at least a week in Patagonia / Torres del Paine and do some hiking there. 

Any suggestions on cities/hikes/ tours would be greatly appreciated.

Schedule: 
I know that while it’ll be “summer” during this time, it won’t be the same summer that I’m used to in the northern hemisphere. I’ve read that Peru is particularly rainy during this season. My initial idea was to start in Ecuador in January, and then make my way south before ending in Argentina at the end of March. However, I’m wondering if it’s better to start in the south (Argentina: January) and make my way north (Ecuador: March) - that way I can travel through Peru in March when it may be (?) better to visit places like Machu Picchu. Is traveling through Peru better in March than in February? I’m guessing it’s marginal but maybe it’s worth it? Is there anything else that I need to consider or anything I’m overlooking?

Roughly planning the following:
- Ecuador: ~10-12 days 
- Peru: ~15 days
- Bolivia: ~10-12 days
- Chile & Argentina: ~50 days 

Budget:
My budget is slightly flexible, but I’m looking to save money where I can. Ideally I’d like to stay under $2,000USD / month. My plan is to stay mostly in hostels and airbnbs and have a mix between eating out/cooking my own food. If anyone has had a similar trip, I’m curious to know if $1,500-2,000USD / month is reasonable. 


Thanks in advance for the help!",2024-10-14 16:26:56
solotravel,1g3nkyz,Taking meds backpacking through Southeast Asia,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3nkyz/taking_meds_backpacking_through_southeast_asia/,3,"Hey everyone, 

I’m to be travelling around South East Asia for 3/4 months in early November (beginning with Thailand London-BKK) and as I’m from the UK I have sorted out my (maximum allowed) prescription of 3 months worth of lamotrigine for my travels. (anti-epileptic meds prescribed for mood disorder)

I’m wondering if anyone has any experience carrying that amount of an uncontrolled, prescribed and for personal use substance like this through customs in Thailand? 

I ask because although this is a legal and uncontrolled substance there, apparently there’s still a 1 month’s worth restriction on meds brought into the country - I will only be in Thailand for the first two weeks and then and move on through other countries so the full amount I’ll be entering with is to carry me through the rest of my trip.

I’ve read people expressing that this hasn’t been a problem for them as long as they’ve had their prescription, medical record or condition diagnosis/doctors note printed off to show on declaration. Some claim to not even had needed to declare either.. but I’d rather be on the safe side to be honest than play about with drug laws in Thailand! I’ve read too many books 😭

Any shared experience would be appreciated 🙏🏼",2024-10-14 18:54:18

I am traveling to Mexico for a month from the USA. I will be required to work from home from Mexico City for the first week. 

Once I finish my WFH week I want to travel around the country (Oaxaca/PE/etc). I do not want to have to carry my work computer as it is a very heavy and bulky computer. I will be returning back to Mexico City in the end to take my departing flight.

As I see it I can do the following:

1. Get over it and carry it around and be responsible for it for the next 3 weeks.
2. Find someone to store the computer (the hotel (HYATT)/ storage company / ??? )
3. ship it home?

My research shows that shipping is expensive and often very slow. I want to find somewhere safe I can leave it in Mexico City but I'm unsure what a truly safe option is.

Does anyone have any advice on this situation? Thanks in advance :)",2024-10-14 03:17:25
solotravel,1g3bkiu,7 day itinerary for solo traveller in Japan?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3bkiu/7_day_itinerary_for_solo_traveller_in_japan/,9,"Hey, I am 23M from the UK. I am currently living in Ibaraki Prefecture until March as an English teacher. I plan to be here until the end of my contract in March. I want to see as much as possible and the only available time to travel will be at Christmas. I can visit the North more easily by car and really only plan to visit areas in Sendai, Fukushima and possibly Hokkaido in February.

The South has more things that I want to see and do, but is more expensive and complicated. Here is a plan that I have been thinking of. Is it far too ambitious? Are there cheaper ways of transport? I don't think I am eligibile for a train pass as I am a resident of Japan. Is there one that I could use?

My plan is:

Day 1: Fly to Hiroshima from Haneda (stay in Tokyo day before for New Year's) --> go to Miyahima via ferry

Day 2: Travel to Kobe and Himeji. Spend the day in both cities and go to Osaka.

Day 3: Osaka

Day 4: Nara

Day 5: Kyoto

Day 6: Nagoya ---> shinkansen back to Tokyo / Ibaraki

I am planning on flying to Hiroshima and then using trains / shinkansen to travel between each city. I have been to Osaka and Kyoto before, so am focusing more on the other cities. I want to sightsee and visit museums (particularly shrines, castles and the Peace Museum in Hiroshima). I wanted to visit the Nintendo Museum but it seems it is already getting sold out. I have found cheap hostels / capsule hotels to stay in, so the whole week seems plausible to me.

Thanks!",2024-10-14 09:09:25
solotravel,1g3bfcd,Vietnam 9 days itinerary and cost check,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3bfcd/vietnam_9_days_itinerary_and_cost_check/,5,"I will solo travel in Vietnam from 17th to 26th of October before heading to Australia. I solo traveled multiple times before, but never in Asia AND I have procrastinated the planning till the last moment so I want to check with someone who has been there/can give suggestions!

* 17th: Arrive in Hanoi at 1pm, check in at the hostel, see Train street, Hoan Kiem Lake, Ngcoc temple, Old quarter, and get a haircut (long due :)) 
* 18th: Temple of Literature, One Pillar Pagoda, Tran Quoc, and have a Muay Thai class 

*  19th-20th: 7am leave for Cat Ba island on a cruise. The Cruise costs 113$ and includes 2 lunches, 1 dinner, 1 breakfast, 1 night sleeping on the cruise, trekking, kayaking and visit to Cat Ba and Viet Hai. On 20th I come back to Hanoi, get some rest, wash my clothes. Hotel 15$.
* 21st: Essentially just resting and visiting Hanoi all day, then take a sleeper bus to Ha Giang (19$ with private cabin)
* 22nd-24th: Ha Giang loop. Here everything is planned by the agency I am going with. I saw their tour and it looks great for backpackers. Total cost for 3 days is 150$ (3x Breakfast, 3x Lunch, 2x Dinner, 2 nights in hotel, motorcycle that either I or the guide will drive, visits). Sleeper bus on 24th night back to Hanoi
* 25th: Chill around Hanoi, then head to the airport at 2pm.

Total is: 30$ for 3 nights of hotels, 113$ for the cruise all incl, 150$for Ha Giang all incl, 75$ for the food that is not included in the packages, 40$ for sleeper busses. So around 420$ ttl, I know I will end up spending more on other things, just wanted to check if those prices are somewhat acceptable.

What do you think of this plan? Am I missing out on something? I don't want to rush things too much, but I still want to see some cool places. My initial plan was to go to Ha Long bay, but after seeing how crowded and dirty it can be, I opted for Cat Ba. The Ha Giang loop seems like an amazing experience from the pics I saw.",2024-10-14 08:58:04

I'm in Europe for 3 months with my dog, first half of the trip I'm in a big campervan and 2nd half I'll rent a car and hostels/airbnb (dogs aren't always allowed)
It's been about 3 weeks now and I find myself not really enjoying this at all, I drove from France to now Denmark (omw to norway) and its just exhausting
I'm avoiding big cities because of how difficult driving this massive van is in busy cities and I keep catching myself thinking this would be easier with someone or I wish I wasn't alone visiting all these places
Any tips on meeting people when you're not in hostels? I've talked to ppl here and there on campsites but nothing more than that

There's also the fact that you can't bring your dog everywhere in Europe so I've been spending most of my time outside in nature or walking through small towns
I just want this to be a good experience and I was so excited to do this but now I'm just disappointed and I'm looking for ways to change that 😅
The fact that's its been raining almost every day also doesn't help haha

I’ve been to some really nice seaside towns around Europe (Greek islands, Italy island etc) and was wondering which places you’d recommend if I am visiting Croatia for the first time? 
So far I’ve narrowed down Split or Dubrovnik but those seem to be large areas too. I’m in my early 30s and would love to join day trips for a day or 2. Ideally would really prefer a place that has both views and convenience for meals/grocery. I also don’t have much concern on budget yet. Thanks for any tips!

I’m an Indian passport holder with a Schengen visa valid till July 2025. I am planning a 2-month trip from Paris from January 2025 to February 2025 and would love some feedback on my itinerary and some advice regarding immigration concerns. I’ll be working remotely during the trip, so it’s a mix of exploration and keeping up with work. Here’s the current itinerary:

* **Peru**: 3 weeks (Machu Picchu is my must-see!)
* **Bolivia**: 1 week
* **Colombia**: 1 week
* **Guatemala**: 1.5 weeks
* **Belize**: 0.5 weeks
* **Mexico**: 1.5 weeks

I’ll be flying out of Paris and returning there afterward. I wanted to add Chile, Argentina, or Brazil, but I’m trying to avoid applying for more visas right now, so I dropped them from the list.

I’m also concerned about immigration, particularly in Mexico. My Schengen visa is valid until July 2025, but at the time of entry into Mexico, it will be slightly less than 180 days before expiry (around Feb 1). I’ve heard Mexico/Peru has a rule that requires 180 days of validity on entry. Does anyone have experience with this or advice on how to handle it?

Do you know how my itinerary looks overall? Would you happen to have any suggestions for changes or additions? I’m excited about Peru but open to tweaking the rest of the trip based on your feedback. Thanks in advance for any advice!

  
This is the first time I have come to Europe and the first time I will travel to the Americas, so any advice will be welcomed.",2024-10-14 13:32:32

I can work remotely on my own from anywhere with WiFi. I 100% support myself since moving out my Senior year of highschool to Miami where I’ve lived for the last 6 months. I love the beaches and tropical weather but I’m starting to understand how blessed I truly am with my situation and as a young male with almost no responsibilities (except making money) I am told from all my mentors I should be TRAVELING now. Worry about settling down later on in life.

I’ll be in Miami for one more month before I go back to my parents house for the holidays, I plan on starting my adventure one of the first 2 weeks of January.

I plan on going to Thailand first for at least a month (Bangkok & Koi Samui) 

After that I plan on going back home, getting a change of luggage and go to Sweden (possibly Stockholm) for a month. I am 100% okay with the cold, I’ve survived Chicago winters. I plan on doing a Ski lodge style Airbnb, I love snowboarding and would like to make that happen in a beautiful environment such as Sweden. I am also open to being flexible knowing that I’d rather bounce around where things feel right than stick hard to a “plan”

After Sweden I’d go home, drop off my winter gear and hit somewhere cheap in the Carribean for a month and waste away on a beach lol. Somewhere more southern, I’ve explored a lot of the northern Carribean. Would appreciate some suggestions!

Then I’d plan on going to France & Italy to end things off April-May before all my college buddies come back home for the summer.

I think I can pack very light, a backpack only for Thailand I’ve heard is the best. I’ll need a suitcase for Sweden since winter clothes are more bulky. 

But yeah any suggestions you guys might have or just advice from your own experience I would really appreciate. I’m going into this alone wanting to find out more about myself & I’m told traveling is the best form of education lol. I’m open minded so feedback of any kind would be great, thanks!",2024-10-14 20:06:35
solotravel,1g2b3og,What keeps you traveling solo? ,244,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g2b3og/what_keeps_you_traveling_solo/,389,"This is going to start off as a bit of a downer but I'm hoping there might be a few gentle souls open to sharing their insights.

I am on a solo trip right now and it all feels so pointless. I'm spending money on seeing and experiencing new, cool things, sure - but why? I'm taking pictures for my memories and to share with my family and friends, and it makes it feel even more fake and pointless, as if I'm here to just check a box and say ""See where I've been?"" I journal a lot too but it feels just like the pictures at that point.

I have gone on many solo trips before and this is the first time this hits me. I keep thinking about that famous Into the Wild quote: ""Happiness is only real if shared."" I have a good guess as to why it's hitting me (I'm on this solo trip because the person who was supposed to accompany me after planning this trip together for over a year, and spending several years together, broke up with me just two months ago) but the cause doesn't change the result: this trip of a lifetime feels empty, and traveling solo in general has completely lost its luster. Yes I can do whatever I want, ""find myself"", but why?

The food I'm eating I could probably find at home because I am fortunate enough to live in a global city. The culture and history is interesting, but then again, what does that bring except some fun facts and pictures to boast about? The language is extremely different from any I know, so despite attempts at learning, connecting with locals is pretty much a dead end, and even then, wouldn't they have pretty much the same dreams and struggles as everyone else in the world?

I'm eating, sleeping, pooping, walking, exploring and living on my own as I would anywhere (including at home). Except I happen to be in a foreign country. What's the point?

So, what keeps you going? Any inspired travelers?

EDIT: wow, just wow. I expected maybe a couple responses and instead got hundreds of wonderful perspectives of all the ways in which people feel the passion for travel ignited within them. I have been passively reading as the busiest period of my trip was happening but I have some downtime now so I figured I’d take a moment to properly come back here and answer some comments (though there are so many now, it’ll be a bit tough to manage!). 

To those who diagnosed me as a traveller with a broken heart whose emptiness doesn’t stem from the travel but from the grief of a relationship: damn. And bingo. I think I had hoped that I would feel empowered by going on my own to fulfill the travel dream that was supposed to be a shared experience. Instead, everything has been bittersweet and I guess I wondered for a second if this was the solo travel in and of itself. But as with everything in life, context matters. There is wonderful advice in the comments, so thank you everyone, and if anyone is in a similar position, take a look through them! Especially the ones about taking it slow and focusing on doing things that I (and only I) would enjoy. 

To those who just engaged with the question of the post and shared your “why”: thank you, because there are some general common trends, but there are also a lot of unique perspectives and it has been a gift to hear so many different insights. 

Not all is well, I still cry and feel empty, but I also have moments of feeling cheerful while just sitting on my own as I observe a gorgeous view or enjoy a delicious meal. In those moments I am reminded that this simple, slow contentment is enough and is what solo travel is about. 

I hope you keep the insights coming and in the meantime, here’s to life and travel and being human, with all the sweetness and the bitterness. ",2024-10-12 22:06:36

I fly in to Mumbai ~the 12th of December and arrive near midnight 13th into 14th. I leave Mumbai for the US ~27 of December. Stuck with my tickets as is :(. 

I'd like a gut check if the following is doable/makes sense. Willing to tweak or change based on suggestions. I appreciate any ideas or feedback as while I've done other Asian countries this is my first time in India and you folks most certainly know better than me.

12/14 fly to Hyderabad. Explore Hyderabad which has some cool sights like Charminar and a reputation for fantastic food (but probably everywhere in India has amazing food). This is also a good in between point en route to Hampi.

12/17 fly from Hyderabad to Hubbali. Take train from Hubbali to Hampi. Explore Hampi through the 20th.
 
12/20: take the night train to Bengaluru. Spend a couple days exploring here. 

12/22 fly to Kochi. Spend some days resting at the beach. 

12/25 fly back to Mumbai. Do it this early so that if anything was delayed or went wrong, I'd have a full day to still make it. 

12/27 return to the states.

My top priorities:

1. Food. Will eat almost anything and will eat as hot as I can get. 

2. Temples

3. Beaches.
4. Museums or botanicals or other cultural things to see. 

Getting to Hampi combined with my starting/ending in Mumbai make this quite challenging for me to plan.

Same thing with restaurants - I don't want to make someone uncomfortable when they're eating.

solotravel,1g2tnhh,Seeking advice for planning,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g2tnhh/seeking_advice_for_planning/,13,"Hi,

I want to embark on my first ever big solo transcontinental trip from the beginning of june until the beginning of august. I am now researching the best ways to travel free of worries and be smart with by budget. I would like to have some feedback on my plans so far.

At the time of my trip I will be 19M. I will have a total budget of 9 to 10K €. My only criteria for this trip was to go as far away as possible from my home country in central Europe and to do some WWOOFing. I settled on New Zealand as the main country I want to visit. I have some experience travelling solo around Europe but I havent travelled transcontinetal before.

My itinerary (as I have planned right now) would look like this: Vienna to LA on the 1st of June, spend a week in LA visiting a friend there. Then continue onto Auckland, stay in NZ until the end of July (travel around, do some WWOOFing, etc). Then I would fly to either Sydney or Brisbane and visit as much of Australias eastern coast as I can in \~2 weeks. After that I'd go back home as I have to take entry exams for Uni and organise the whole moving process.

Regarding financials and travel insurance: Totals on flights would be between 2 and 2.5k (including miscellaneous expenses around that), maybe a little less, as of today. I would also like to get a credit card (N26) for paying and taking out cash worldwide without fees and get a second one (AMEX Gold) for insurance and collecting miles and points, but that would go through my mom or sister with a secondary card as I dont meet the income criteria for being the main owner. In addition to that I am also planning to get insurance through my family's insurance providers, dont have details on that yet, though.

Do you think the budget will cut it? And do you have any tips/recommendationis regarding payments, credit cards etc. and general stuff?

Thanks!

  
EDIT: [https://imgur.com/a/EDxC7uf](https://imgur.com/a/EDxC7uf) this is a possible budget, I think I calculated it rather conservatively, but let me know your thoughts!",2024-10-13 16:32:43

I'll be there for 3 weeks in mid-February, flying in to Osaka and only booking a few nights accomodation. I figure I can find my feet when I'm there, I've heard there's plenty to do and you can go without a real plan (can you advise if this is the case?).

Love to do a few nights in Hakuba snowboarding, then go to Tokyo before heading back to Osaka to catch my flight out.

I'm an active person and am excited about the idea of exploring the different regions, as well as enjoying the food and night life.

I also have a lot of tattoos, nothing offensive - should I cover these the entire time I'm there?

PS. I'm Australian, and will be 31 at the time of this trip. Hoping this can be the trip that sparks my solo travel journeys :)",2024-10-13 10:05:28

For context, I travelled around lots of Europe for almost 3 months and returned back to my home in Canada two months ago. Most of the trip was great, some ups and downs, I wasn't feeling all the best all the time but for the majority of it I was having a blast. I think being solo for almost all of it made me confront a lot of my inner thoughts and feelings, so trying to navigate that while changing my setting a lot caused a rollercoaster of emotions.

But beyond the typical wonder of travel and exploring, I ended up having a short romance with someone on my trip (a local) and I didn't want to leave. This was near the end of my trip, so I already had my plane ticket home and things booked, plus the expiration date on my visa. But in a perfect world void of any commitments or responsibilities, I would have stayed to see how things developed. Granted, this was only a week long romance and I understand that I was in exceptional circumstances while travelling with the whole rose-coloured glasses and what not. But I haven't been able to shake my experience with this person and it has been over two months since I left their city.

Being home now, I'm feeling like my life is so dull. This big trip was supposed to be something I did after I graduated university to get a bit of travel under my belt before starting a career full time. Now that I'm starting my career I just feel dread that I'm starting to work towards a life here while I feel a pull to head back Europe to live at least for a bit. I think the fact that I travelled solo for such a long time altered my brain a bit. Like if the trip was shorter, I could feel like it was a vacation, but the way that I extended it so long made me develop feelings of staying.

Even if this person moves on, it's the fact that I felt like I found a place for me to flourish and be myself overseas which is something I lack at home. I had planned to wait things out and allow myself to move on but for months now I've just been in a weird state of mind where I feel sad and directionless and want to take steps towards an internship or something overseas to live there even for a little bit. I feel kind of delusional but I can't shake some feelings I have and just want to just hear from other people that may have experienced something similar. Has anyone else had a similar experience or advice for getting through these feelings?",2024-10-11 18:08:03

solotravel,1g1ef2b,Trip Report: I went to Angkor Wat for the past few days.,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g1ef2b/trip_report_i_went_to_angkor_wat_for_the_past_few/,58,"I’m currently on a long Southeast Asia trip, and on my way between Thailand and Vietnam, I stopped in Cambodia mainly to see Angkor Wat. 

To be honest, I wasn’t feeling super excited to go. I’d seen *so* many temples in Thailand — in Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, around and in the cities, everywhere I went. I started feeling very burnt on temples. But I’m in Southeast Asia damnit and there’s no way I’m leaving without seeing Angkor Wat!

The moment I got off the plane and stepped outside, I was greeted by what would soon become a regular sight: the incessant Tuk-Tuk drivers trying to get me to hire them. By the end of the trip, I was so sick of walking down the streets of Siem Reap and being unable to get them to leave me alone. 

Once I got into town, I bought a 3 day pass and went to explore Angkor Wat right away. If I’d known better, I would have started the next day so I could get a full day in — I didn’t realize that the days could be used non consecutively. Regardless, I walked around Angkor Wat for a few hours, just taking it in by myself. It was incredible (more on that later)

The next day, I did a group tour for the sunrise. The sunrise was indeed amazing, but I was not a fan of the tour — I like taking things at my own speed, and the tour was simultaneously moving throughout the grounds at a snail pace while only having a limited time at the temple. I ended up ditching the tour, and went to grab something to eat, then later rented a motorbike and explored the nearby temples by myself.

That was the best decision I made! Having the freedom to roam from temple to temple was just an indescribable feeling. I highly recommend everyone to do this. I spent the next two days exploring the temples this way.

So that’s more or less what I *did*, but how did I feel about it?

Holy shit I was an ignorant dummy for not being excited about this place. I can’t get it off my mind. I’ve seen so many places in the world, and manmade things have generally stopped being impressive to me on the level of the natural world. Until now. Angkor wat is *UNBELIEVABLE*. I felt a sense of awe and wonder going to the temples in the Angkor complex that borders on religious, and I’m not religious. The majesty of it all.. the amount of human effort put into it.. the SCALE.. I just can’t believe it, even just thinking about it now. There wouldn’t be 30 seconds that would go by without me having the urge to take a photo from a different vantage point. This is “it’s worth traveling across the world just to see this” level stuff.

I’m also convinced there is a right and a wrong way of experiencing Angkor. I met a lot of tourists, especially others doing longer trips, or the types to stay at hostels, who only got a single day pass, and did a sunrise tour and saw a couple extra temples. They described their experience as “exhausting”. I feel really bad for these people because they just didn’t take the correct approach. I appreciate tours for the context and history — and definitely have one spliced in there — but this is a massive park for you to EXPLORE on your own time, not on the time table of your tour guide and 20 other people in your tour group. Driving around,  it knowing what is gonna be behind the next corner, and EVERY SINGLE TIME being awe struck — that’s what Angkor is about. Maybe the right tour exists that goes exactly at your pace, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I could spend a week just walking around these temples. It should be a fulfilling experience, full of life and even spirituality, not exhausting one. 

As I leave Cambodia, I can’t help but feel sad that I don’t know the next time I’ll be back to see Angkor Wat. I feel like I’m leaving part of my soul here — or maybe I’m taking a new part with me. I really hope I’m able to make it back here some day. It’s a highlight not only of this trip, but all of my travels to date.",2024-10-11 16:52:17
solotravel,1g1zrts,End November / December : first time japan or 2nd Thailand ? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g1zrts/end_november_december_first_time_japan_or_2nd/,12,"Hi  

I’m torn for my next travel and would need advices. I’ve made my research, tried to weigh the pros and cons but I still can’t make my mind about it.

I can travel up to 3 weeks and can’t decide between doing either :

- Japan : golden route for around 2 weeks
- SEA  : mainly Thailand : krabi / chiang mai then cross border to Laos and maybe Cambodia in 3 weeks. I’ve been to Thailand but just did Bangkok and Gulf islands so far. Never Laos / Cambodia.

It would be high season in SEA, a bit lower in Japan. Flights tickets prices are similar (~550€). Japan is more expensive but I’ve looked on booking and right now dorms 
 seems cheap. Food too. 

I’m not into parties anymore, I just want to enjoy local food, scenery, nature, cycling, hiking if possible. Although, I also enjoy scuba and snorkelling, It could be postponed to another trip.

SEA will be hot compared to European december and I like that. However, I’ve been there already and wondering if it wouldn’t just be similar with days spent on beaches and temples visit.  (Still good life though)

On another hand, I’m not crazy about Japan and its culture like some people but can definitely see the interest as it seems different from the rest of the world. From my research, there is a lot to see. One con is the weather. 

Would you have any advices ? On Japan I read posts saying it’s a perfect solo traveler destination and others saying it’s the worse as it can be quite lonely. I don’t know what to think. 

I don’t know what to search / read / watch to decide myself. 

If some people did both I would be glad to have their opinion ! 

Thanks a lot !

solotravel,1g1ikzc,Seeking feedback on my 2+ week itinerary to Vietnam in December,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g1ikzc/seeking_feedback_on_my_2_week_itinerary_to/,11,"Hi all,

Looking for some feedback on the itinerary I've put together. Nothing is locked in yet (except the start and end dates) but I've never been to Vietnam and wanna start booking stuff soon.

About me: mid-30s American man, experienced solo traveler. Interests: food, nature/hiking, history/culture, traveling at a fast but casual pace. Not interested in: partying/clubs, finding people to travel out with, spending all day in museums. I typically don't come with a detailed itinerary, but some rough idea of spots I wanna hit and only booking what absolutely must be booked ahead of time (flights, super popular spots, nice restaurants, etc.). Budget isn't really an issue, though I don't wanna be stupid about things. 

Itinerary:

* 12/15: arrive in Ho Chi Minh City
* 12/15 - 12/17: HCMC
* 12/17: Fly to Hoi An
* 12/17 - 12/20: some combo of Hoi An, Da Nang, and Hue
* 12/20 - 12/21: Bus to Phong Nha National Park (or fly to Dong Hoi), stay the night there
* 12/21 - 12/25: 3 night cave tour in Phong Nha ([this one](https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-tien-exploration/#lich-trinh-tung-ngay))
   * This is the pivot point of the trip, both because it's such a long tour right in the middle and because it needs the most planning ahead of time
* 12/25: Depart Phong Nha, head to Ninh Binh
* 12/25 - 12/27: Ninh Binh
* 12/27 - 12/30: Hanoi
* 12/30: Fly from Hanoi to Hong Kong
* 12/30 - 1/3: Hong Kong and Macau (haven't figured out details here yet)
* 1/4: Return flight out of Hong Kong

A few considerations I've had:

* I could shorten the trek in Phong Nha, there are 1 or 2 night trek options, but I don't get the chance to do this stuff very often so I'd need a good reason to choose a shorter one.
   * I also have no idea what it's like getting into/out of Phong Nha and if that'd require more planning than I'm thinking, particularly since I'd be leaving on Christmas Day. If people have advice here please let me know. 
* I've heard mixed things about HCMC; some have told me it's awesome, others have said it's kind of a generic big city in Asia. Whereas everyone has been very positive about Hanoi and said it feels more culturally Vietnamese and the food is way better. So I chose more time there. The time in Hanoi is really just using it as a home base, might take some day trips to Ha Long Bay or other places. 
* I've heard that Da Nang is kinda blah but Hue and Hoi An are can't miss. So not sure how to divvy up those days yet. The hardest places to drop have been Nha Trang and Sa Pa but they're so far out of the way idk how to make it work. 
* I'd been planning to spend New Years in Hong Kong just because I assumed it would be a bigger celebration since it's a much bigger city, but that's not locked in, if there's somewhere in Vietnam (or even elsewhere in the area) that'd be better I'm open to that. 

The only things locked in right now are the flight to HCMC and the return from HK, and I got my Vietnam E-Visa. I'm open to changing pretty much anything else as I go, except the trek in Phong Nha will need to be booked ahead of time.

I know many people overpack their itineraries and I feel like I’m conscious of this so I sometimes have the opposite issue and don’t plan enough. Please let me know what you think:  
  
Day 1:

Land and get sorted around midday. 

See Brandenberg gate, the Jewish memorial and the Reichstag (need to book time slot). 
  
Day 2:

Topography of terror museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Black Box Cold War museum.   
  
Day 3:  
  
Jewish museum, Boros Foundation (pre book) Berlin Wall Memorial. 
  
Day 4:

Berlin Cathedral, DDR museum, TV Tower, East Side Gallery. 
  
Day 5:  
  
Fly home early. 
  
Please let me know if I’m missing anything obvious, I’m particularly interested in 1900s history, so the world wars and the Cold War, which obviously there’s tons of in Berlin so feel free to recommend anything you think I might like. I also would like to fit the zoo in but not sure if I have enough time, so let me know what you think :)",2024-10-11 21:04:17
solotravel,1g14snp,Greece Itinerary Early November ,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g14snp/greece_itinerary_early_november/,17,"Hi!, I pulled the trigger and booked a good deal on a flight to Athens, Greece, from November 4th to November 13th. This will be my first solo travel trip to Europe. I know that November is the low season for Greece, and beaches and islands are not my interests on this trip. I want to focus on the mainland and enjoy Greek food along the way. Here is my rough itinerary:

* **4 NOV**: Arrive in Athens in the evening and have dinner in Plaka.
* **5 NOV**: Acropolis, Parthenon, and Acropolis Museum.
* **6 NOV**: Mount Lycabettus and Philopappou Hill.
* **7 NOV**: Full-day trip to Delphi and Arachova.
* **8 NOV**: Half-day trip to the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion.
* **9 NOV**: Full-day tour to Mycenae, Epidaurus, and Nafplio.
* **10 NOV**: Ancient Agora and Temple of Hephaestus.
* **11 NOV**: National Archaeological Museum and Kifisia.
* **12 NOV**: Shopping or visiting remaining sites and preparing for departure back home.
* **13 NOV**: Flight back home in the afternoon.

What do you think about it? Any advice is welcome. Also, if you can help me with the following questions:

1. What activities can I do in the evening as a solo traveler (no partying or clubbing)?
2. How safe is public transportation in Athens? I'm scared of all the TikToks about pickpockets in the EU.
3. Do I need to pre-book accommodation (Airbnb) beforehand? I'm used to SEA, where I can wing it.

I would appreciate any ideas you have for me on this!",2024-10-11 08:08:56

I’m considering a trip to San Diego in mid December because I can get a really cheap flight. I have a rough itinerary:

Day 1 - land in the afternoon and immediately drive out to Palm Springs. It’ll probably be dinner time so I’ll just wander around town. 

Day 2/3 Joshua Tree hikes. I’ve got my eye on the following: Panorama Loop, Hidden Valley, Barker Dam, Forty Nine Palms, Arch Rock, Skull Rock, Split Rock, Cholla Cactus Garden. Most of these seem to be shorter trails (except for the first one) so I’m thinking I could cross most off. 

Day 4 - either Ladder Canyon Trail or Indian Canyons. Then I’d head back to San Diego. Hoping to go to Annie’s Canyon trail on the way back. Drop car off, head to hostel in Gaslamp Quarter. 

Day 5-8: San Diego time. One day will be the zoo and wandering around Balboa Park. Another day I’d like to check out Seaport Village, Little Italy, the suspension bridge, and head up to Old Town. On another day I was planning to start at the Mission Boardwalk area and head down to the Sunset Cliffs area. On the final day I want to go to La Jolla for the seals, and then head up north from there to Torrey Pines. This may seem like a dumb question, but is it possible to walk/hike that whole stretch? I’m taking a look on Google maps and it seems doable up until the golf course area. I’d take public transit home after for sure. 

I may also have the option to add on two days right at the start - no increase on the flight cost, just additional accommodations, food and such. The car rental works out cheaper on days 1-4, so I’d be flying in, spending two nights in the city, then getting the car and heading out to Joshua Tree. I’m considering staying in a hostel in Ocean Beach area for those first two nights and doing the sunset cliffs/mission beach things then instead. 

Hoping to get any recommendations, open to suggestions! I’m looking for a budget trip, so a lot of wandering around, and not many paid attractions. I’ve got the zoo on there but am open to another attraction or two (maybe one of the aquariums?). I always walk a lot on vacations, and love checking out different neighbourhoods in between destinations - however, that’s what’s worked for me in Europe and NYC, not sure how the rest of the US is. Not into nightlife. As it is December I am expecting the weather to be a little chilly, not beach weather. I really want to see seals on this trip and I’ve read that December is good for whale watching, so any tips on how to see that are greatly appreciated! ",2024-10-11 03:29:27
solotravel,1g0l1dx,Five days for two cities in Europe?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g0l1dx/five_days_for_two_cities_in_europe/,16,"I have an upcoming trip through Europe coming up in the winter. I will land in Vienna and will depart from Istanbul six days later. I've been to Vienna before, was fascinated for one day and was bored for the rest of my time there so this trip I am not looking to spend much if any time there other than passing through. I am considering stopping by an additional city before making my way over to Istanbul, specifically, Bratislava and/or Budapest. Traveling solo and on a budget but can splurge if the experience warrants it, not a party or nightlife person, looking for the usual tourist experience of seeing some attractions but also like to just walk through the neighborhood and ""take it in"" though I'm well aware that this may not necessarily be the popular thing to do during winter, and wouldn't consider myself a foodie but I do appreciate a good meal.

Here's the dilemma. I have five days to explore these cities (Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul). Changing the flights to extend the trip isn't currently an option. People recommend 1-2 days in Bratislava, 4-5 days in Budapest, and a week plus in Istanbul, time that I do not have. My inclination is to drop Bratislava, and do 2 days Budapest, 0.5 days flight from Budapest, 2.5 days Istanbul, but is this justifiable or am I going to not do justice for any one or either destinations? Plus, there are also numerous Reddit threads across various subs criticising each respective cities, ranging from expensive meals in Budapest (e.g. 20-25€ average? That's what I expect in Western Europe, not Hungary) to scamming taxi drivers and overpriced attractions in Istanbul (e.g. 45€ admission for Topkapi palace??? And similar prices for other top attractions within the city?), things that would discourage me to spend more time in either cities. I guess my question is, what should I do, somewhat keep my current itinerary and spend roughly two days in either Budapest and Istanbul, shift my schedule such that I spend a lot more time in Budapest and minimise my time in Istanbul to only catch my flight out, or, vice versa, cut out Budapest altogether and spend more time in Istanbul, or some other suggestion?",2024-10-10 15:10:01

-Fly from US to London- land Sunday morning and stay 4 nights at the Wombat's

-Take the LNER to Edinburgh early Thursday morning and stay 2 nights at Castle Rock

-Fly from Edinburgh to Dublin Saturday evening and stay 3 nights at Jacob's Inn (would like to take daytrip to Galway/west Irish coast?)

-Fly from Dublin to Paris Tuesday evening and stay 4 nights at The People- Paris Bercy

**Fly from Paris to London/LHR (10-10:30am) and fly back to the US from London/LHR at 12:40pm.

I've looked at the Eurostar as well and flying is cheaper.)

Right now, I think my hard budget is $3000. Lodging and flights/trains right now come out to about $1300. When I travel, I do always eat out but not necessarily fancy and I like to spend money on attractions. Is this a reasonable budget?

And interested in hearing your stories too!

I (30F, and white as feel that might be relevant!) was solo at Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpar when a Malaysian man (40-50 years) came up to me, very friendly, and asked where I am from. I told him UK but didn't really want to engage more so just smiled and made to move on when he asked me to take a group photo. 

I thought he meant of him and a group he came with so suddenly feeling like I understood why he approached me I said yes enthusiastically before realising he meant the two of us! I felt too awkward to back out then so we did the photo. 

I was then sort of stuck with him on the steps, if I climbed he came with me and if I stopped he stopped. I had a rucksack with me which he offered to carry but I politely declined. He asked me my age (i tried to brush it off with asking what he thought and he said 18 which is ridiculous but also made it feel a bit more uncomfortable) and then when I said I was quite a bit older he asked I was married. Again I tried to laugh it off as I was feeling quite uncomfortable and told him I was too busy with work and tried to change the subject by asking what he did for work and he just said business and when I asked a bit more he just smiled and shrugged and went quiet.  

By then we were at the top and he walked off so I thought I was free but a minute later he came back with a drink and some popcorn for me. I tried to decline but he really insisted, saying he wanted to give me a gift as a visitor to his country, so I just accepted. 

I was watching a blessing from outside one of the temples and he was just smiling at me so I asked if he knew anything about what they were doing. He looked to be of Indian descent and I thought maybe this was his aim to guide me around the caves and then ask for a tip and I was willing to just to go with it, especially as I felt obliged to give him something because of the drink. He just smiled and shrugged again and offered to take my picture on my phone. I don't think he would have stolen it or anything but I wasn't comfortable handing it over so I just said I was too sweaty for a photo (not untrue haha!). 

He then just followed me around, not really saying anything and I didn't engage him. At one point I turned round and thought he was filming me but not sure so didn't say anything. 

After about 10 mins he offered to take my photo again telling me I looked pretty and I said it had low battery so he said he would take more on his phone and asked for my WhatsApp. I said no thank you and he started to get really insistent that he wanted my WhatsApp. Almost begging, saying how beautiful I am (I am average), how much he likes me and wants to keep in contact. 

I said I was leaving Malaysia today thinking again maybe he was after my business for something but this didn't deter him. He was still smiling but repeatedly asking why I wouldn't give him my WhatsApp, what's wrong with sending messages, did I not like him etc. I just kept saying no thank you and walked away (I saw an elderly white couple at the top of the stairs and was prepared to ask to join them if he didn't leave me alone). 

Thankfully he didn't follow but then annoyingly I got attacked by the monkeys at the top of the steps because I had rushed over there stupidly still holding the bag of popcorn and then it was a right nightmare trying to get it in my backpack while they tried to jump/ climb on me! 😂 

Because of this I spent about 20 mins total at Batu Caves, monkey scratched my leg, I took no photos other than one awkward one at the bottom, and left feeling really flat and uncomfortable. In retrospect I should have cut things off earlier but I'm not really sure how I could have done this.

In January I am heading off on my very first solo adventure outside of Europe. I am heading off to the Philippines for 5 weeks.

Arrival: Manila - Thursday 2nd January 2025.
Departure: Manila - Wednesday 5th February 2025. 

Duration: 5 weeks. 

My first 03-16 days in the Philippines are finalised due to having booked myself onto an Intro Travel Group Tour. I know this is cheating not really solo to begin with. However I want to ease myself into new and unfamiliar surroundings. 

On arrival into the Manila (the Philippines). I will have two free days to spend doing whatever I want. I would quite like to stick around Manila and take in some natural or historical sites. 

So on Day one, I would quite like to visit Intramous and maybe have a guided tour/radio tour around the sites. If it doesn’t take too long I would also like to do Rizal park on this day. 
- however I know it’s just after New Years celebrations so I am unsure on how this park area will be. 
Day two:   I would like to spend near Manila Bay I think. I’m very unsure what I would like to do. Or maybe a museum… or even visiting places like Binondo etc.

Summary of Intro destinations:
 Manila -> Moalboal -> Coron -> 2N/3D Boat Expedition -> El Nido. 

The Tour ends in El Nido. This is where I begin my own solo adventure. 

My plan so far is:   

- 2 extra nights in El Nido *
- 4 nights in Port Barton
- 2 nights in Puerto Princessca
- 4 nights in Bohol
- 3 nights in Siquijior 

** 4 nights in Siargao   

Side note & question!!! 

I am wondering if the two extra nights in El Nido after Intro Tour will be overkill? 
- the tour ends with 3 days in El Nido.

* Day 1 - arriving to El Nido. Free afternoon, head out for nightlife. 
* Day 2 - Canopy walk and Filipino massage 
* Day 3 - Nacpan Beach and Jeepney tour inc. organic farm, beach lunch and last drinks.

So far I know nothing about the islands we will visit on the boat expeditions so I do not know if they will be the same ones that come with your regular excursions out of el Nido? 

If not I would like to do Tour C and A I think.





** On the four nights with Siargao I am unsure if I am pushing this trip for time? At the minute I will be leaving from Siquijior on Friday 31st January. Taking the ferry to Dumaguete, flying up to Cebu and then flying to Siargao! All in this will take roughly 7+ hours of travel. Which seems a lot for very little time. 

So what are your thoughts on my final plan for my 20 days after tour? 

* Two nights in El Nido (16th - 18th January) 
* Four nights in Port Barton (18th - 22nd January)
* 2 nights in Puerto Princessca (22nd - 24th January) 
* 4 nights in Bohol (24th - 28th January)
* 3 nights in Siquijior (28th - 31st January) 
* ** 4 nights in Siargao (31st January - 4th February) 
* February 4th - flying back to Manila and staying one night before flying home on Wednesday 5th February. 


Thanks for taking your time to read this blurb of nonsense. Hope it makes sense!  

Enjoy the rest of your year!!!

solotravel,1fzjbl1,Pack Suggestions ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fzjbl1/pack_suggestions/,20,"SOS Gear / Luggage vs. Carry On 

*clarity I’m asking about possibly combining the carryon backpack and trolley to a 70L hiking pack vs keeping the carryon backpack and upgrading the luggage size or should I keep my current setup?*

Hi lovely people, 

I’m living out of my gear up until end of Dec so almost 90days of travel. I’ve done trips previously with my carry on luggage but having to pay for it is getting cumbersome. 

Should I switch to hiking gear / backpack or get a bigger luggage? 

To Note: 
- Female, 5’5, 90kgs (I’m a cushy potato not a hiker) 
- traveling to colder climates the hoodies / winter with a couple of beach days ! 
- I will mostly be staying at hostels no hiking 

Pack/Gear: 
-2 laptops (1 personal and 1 for work!) 
-15tops /  3 light weight tshirts, 5 full length tees, 1 hoodie, 1 sweatshirt, 2going out tops and 1 shearling 
- toiletries and makeup less than 1.5Kg of the gear 
- Dyson air strait that I really do not want to give up but probably the most unreasonable item 
- 5bottoms / 1 legging, 1 fancy legging for nicer days, 1 legging instead of jeans so thicker, 1 sweatpants for travel days, 1 pyjama 
- only 1 shoe 1 flip flops! 
- undergarments / 6socks, 1snow glove, 1 thermal, 5 sport bras, 8underwear 

SOS: 
- should I upgrade the luggage size or update my day carry on size or completely switch to one huge hiking gear? 
- I’ve hiked once in my life and I remember the gear giving me backache soooo which is why I haven’t had the need to switch so far! 
- I don’t want things floating around I want it more compact! ",2024-10-09 04:25:39

I am open to all experiences (hiking, relaxing, various activities, etc) and want to do a lot of exploring as most people do.  I have seen a lot of solo travelers post about the wonders of both and am caught between which one to choose. Both look like amazing locations to explore nature and have good eats but I am not sure which would be most optimal for the time I am going.

I would be flying out of San Francisco and have up to 9 days to spend. 
 
My budget is $2k preferably including the flight and the hostel. 

Thank you so much for any feedback and or advice!

UPDATE: I appreciate the feedback about the harassment and pestering in Morocco, I figured that going into it especially since this isn't my first time (officially) solo traveling. I have just been really interested in the country and what it has to offer.

Are there any areas that are better than others or areas/hostels with tours that anyone would recommend if that were to be an option.",2024-10-08 19:41:22

I'm a relatively young woman (F26) and I want to find a safe way to go to Uyuni for a day. I will be in La Paz, and I have 3 full days/2 nights to go Uyuni.

I'm considering either to fly to Uyuni and book a day tour to see the salt flats, or take an overnight bus but I have a few concerns with either method:

* Safety: Obviously the primary concern here, I'm not too worried about the airport, but more so being at the bus stop at night time, taxis to get to the bus stop in the evening etc.
* Flight delays: Has anyone done the flight and missed their salt flats tour or just been waiting too long?
* Luggage: Uyuni will be the last thing I do on my trip to South America, and I do presume I will have a decent amount of luggage (nothing too crazy but a regular luggage bag + backpack). I'll be starting in La Paz, and I hope to finish there too. I won't be at the same hotel for start/end but I can contact the hotel to hopefully hold a decent amount of my belongings.
* Time: I'd be nice to have a bit more time in La Paz, unless it is a bit dry and not much to do, I'd probably want a bit more of time there, than Uyuni. Or is it worth taking a flight one day to Uyuni, another to Sucre/Cochabamba, and then back to La Paz?

I am also not sure about number of days to spend on each destination and also on border crossing vs flying to next country so i would really appreciate any input on it. I have 3.5 weeks so i am flexible to cut few destinations to prioritize must see destinations.

1. Mexico city/Puebla (3-4 days)
2. take Ado bus to Oaxaca, spend (one or two days)
3. take bus to Puerto Escondido and explore beach towns nearby (2-3 days)
4. Is it worth to go Chiapas/San Cristobal de las Casas and cross the border vs just take bus to Tapachula and cross border into Gautemala? Which border would be better choice?
5. Antigua (2-3 days, including hike to see valcano erruptions). Is there any destination between border and Antigua worth stopping by?
6. Flores and Tikal seems popular destination but my it is in opposite direction to the el salvador/honduras border. My next destination is Nicaragua. I am really confuse here whether i should visit Flores/Tikal or not. If i do then what are my options to enter into Nicargua. Is it worth visiting el salvador/honduras by crossing land border? How are the crime scene in El Salvador and Honduras recently? If people with experiences recommend to avoid el salvador and honduras all together then i will fly to Managua directly.
7. Granada, San juan del Sur, Ometepe (3-4 days)
8. Should I consider visiting Leon? If yes, how many days? Any other destinations in Nicaragua I must see other than in #7?
9. enter into Costa Rica and spend a day in Liberia. then maybe visit beach town playa Potrero/playa flamingo/tamarindo. If these beach towns are not worth visiting then i would like to visit Medellin but i would like to know the crime situation there as well. If relatively safe then i can take flight from Liberia to Medellin. If Medellin is no go then i will fly to Cusco, Peru and end my journey at Machu Picchu and fly back to US.",2024-10-08 21:34:58

solotravel,1fymw79,I played with capybaras and meerkats and got hit by a huge typhoon in Taiwan (trip report),37,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fymw79/i_played_with_capybaras_and_meerkats_and_got_hit/,17,"I just got back from a two-week trip to Taiwan, where I circled the island (5 nights in Taipei, 2 nights in Hualien, 1 night in Taitung, 4 nights in Kaohsiung, 1 night in Tainan, and 1 night in Taoyuan). Taiwan had been near the top of my list for a while and it didn't disappoint.

Some notes from the trip:

* From what I'd seen online, the weather in Taiwan is generally not too bad in late September/early October, but even before the typhoon, it was very rainy and humid. I managed it but I'd recommend waiting until later in the year to go.
* Having been to China last year, Taiwan was much easier to travel. The only complication is that many places don't accept credit cards; you need an Easy Card, which you fill up with cash at convenience stores.
* Taipei is amazing. Redditors gush about it and it lives up to the hype. I had several day trips in mind, although I ended up only doing one (to Keelong and Yehliu Geopark - a nature reserve with bizarre rock formations). There was just so much to see in Taipei that day trips didn't feel necessary. The various districts and parks are enough to justify an entire visit to Taiwan. I spent an hour at the top of Taipei 101 just staring down at the city.
* Taiwan is known for its animal cafes. For just about any cute animal you can think of, you can play with them somewhere in Taiwan. I went to a capybara cafe and a meerkat cafe in the Taipei area, and they were both pure joy. The capybara cafe has two capybaras and two ducks you can feed and pet. The meerkat cafe has meerkats dressed up in shirts who climb on you. These cafes were two highlights both of the trip and of my life.
* The public transportation in Taiwan is perfect.
* I did a bit of hiking in various towns (only before the typhoon - it's dangerous to hike in the following days). I'm a fit person but hiking was a real struggle in that heat and humidity. More reason to visit when it's not hot.
* I planned for two nights in Hualien to visit the nearby gorge, which I only found out later was closed, due to an earthquake earlier in the year. Nevertheless the town had trails, a beautiful beach, and one of the most incredible temples I've ever seen, so I made the most of it.
* When I was in Taitung, it rained a lot again, and I heard rumblings of an oncoming typhoon. I had recently seen news of a typhoon not expected to hit Taiwan, so I didn't think much of it at first. But after some research, I saw that another typhoon - Typhoon Krathon - was on its way to Taiwan. Fortunately my train to Kaohsiung wasn't cancelled, so I left the east side of the island before it got battered by a wall of rain.
* Soon Krathon strengthened to a category 4. It was also on its way to Kaohsiung. I had the chance to change my reservations and move towards the north of the island, where the typhoon would be less severe, but I said ""fuck it"" and decided to ride out the storm, for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I figured, Taiwan's infrastructure was built to withstand more than a strong typhoon. So I stayed in my Airbnb, which was only two miles from where the eye was projected to make landfall. The typhoon took its sweet time at sea, and I had a few days to explore Kaohsiung (fantastic city btw - there's a lot of great art around town) with limited amounts of rain.
* The typhoon finally made landfall on October 3rd, during the day. I drank with my Airbnb host and another guest. I also napped a little, during the worst of the storm. Off in the distance, I could hear the occasional loud snaps of trees being uprooted. After the worst of the storm passed, I walked around town to check out the damage. It was mostly fallen trees and fallen signs - I didn't see any major damage beyond that - and people were already busy cleaning up. Kudos to Taiwan!
* The rest of the trip was pretty cool as well. From what little I saw of it, Tainan (the old capital city) seems lovely. It has a cool fort, some historical streets, and a beautiful city park. Sadly I did see a motorcycle on the ground at an intersection, next to a pool of blood. Don't ride motorcycles, folks.
* I barely spent time there but Taoyuan seems lovely as well.",2024-10-08 00:16:50

Been lurking in this sub while researching for an upcoming trip. This is my first time doing such a long solo trip and am slightly nervous about doing it right.  
Looking for some advice / feedback beforehand.

**Background:** 32M. American. \~15 countries, 4 continents. Spanish speaking/listening is A2 while reading at low B1. Budget is to stay in hostels and cook my own meals in smaller towns, hotels and restaurants in large cities. Willing to spend more if the experience is once-in-a-lifetime. When traveling I prefer outdoor spaces and nice views over bars/nightlife. Packing in an 85L backpack.

**Itinerary:**  
Dec 5: Arrive in Santiago, Las Condes/Providencia hotel, groceries, Borago.  
Dec 6 - 10: Fly to Calama, wing it on experiences  
Dec 10 - 11: Gap day in Santiago, groceries (no hotel yet, considering Barrio Italia)  
Dec 11 - 15: Fly to Rapa Nui, need to find a guide and explore as much as possible  
Dec 16 - 17: Central Chile, possibly basecamp in Vina for some easy nothing days?  
Dec 18 - 23: Fly to Cusco  
Dec 24: Back home, probably should make an appearance for family gatherings.

**Planned Experiences:**  
San Pedro de Atacama: Stargazing, El Tatio, Lagunas Altiplanicas, Valle de la Luna  
Central Chile: Cerro San Cristobal, Mercado Central, Museo de la Memoria..., wine tour, Valparaiso  
Rapa Nui: Sunrise at Tongariki, bike to Anakena, Rano Raraku, Rano Kau hike, Orongo village, sunset with ceviche  
Cusco: acclimate and chew on coca leaves, 2 day Inca Trail, Machu Picchu

**Requested advice:**  
Food - This is where I struggle most. What are some favorite meals that are cheap, packable, and easy to cook? My half-baked plan is PBJ rollups, rice + beans, and local fruits.  
Solo packing essentials - what supplies are needed for long solo travel that you don't need for other trips? Initial thoughts are first aid kits, detergent pods, utensils, bags/containers.  
Experiences - any advice on must-do for Cusco? This is my lightest planned spot. Any overrated experiences listed above that can be skipped? Ditch my plans and wing it?  
Accommodations - where would you recommend in Cusco?  
Itinerary - is it too aggressive?  
General - what do you wish you would've known before your first solo travel?

solotravel,1fy8ui9,First Solo Travel : Seeking Itinerary Feedback & Party Hostel Tips for Europe,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fy8ui9/first_solo_travel_seeking_itinerary_feedback/,38,"Hi everyone! 😄  
I’m excited (and a bit nervous) for my first solo trip to Europe this November and could use some advice.  
I’ll arrive in Barcelona on November 13th and need to be in Milan by November 22nd.  
Here’s my current itinerary and some additional context:

**Itinerary So Far:**

* **Barcelona:** Nov 13 - Nov 18 (Kabul Hostel already booked here)
* **Florence and Bologna:** Considering stops in each before arriving in Milan (arriving by flight to florence)
* **Milan:** Nov 22 - Nov 25 (Departure)

**About Me & My Goals:**

* **Age & Interests:** 25M, primarily interested in socializing, nightlife, and meeting fellow travelers.
* **Travel Style:** Looking to stay in party hostels or social hostels that make it easy to connect with people.
* **Avoiding:** Rain (if possible!) and long travel times between cities.

**Budget & Preferences:**

* **Budget:** Flexible but aiming to keep things moderate – I’m open to recommendations for hostels in the mid-range.
* **Preference for Hostels:** I prefer lively spots with a reputation for good social scenes and maybe organized events or pub crawls.

**General questions:**

1. **Does this itinerary seem realistic given my goals?** I'm wondering if Florence and Bologna make sense for a social trip, or if there are better alternatives.
2. **Any specific hostel recommendations** in Florence or Bologna for meeting people and enjoying the nightlife?
3. **Travel Tips** for minimizing travel time?

Thanks so much for your help!  
Any suggestions or insights would be amazing.

  
  
  
  
  
**\*\* EDIT:** I can’t really change my time in Milan since my family will be joining me there, so my main focus is on planning the time between Barcelona and Milan.

solotravel,1fy8yrt,Laid-back beach vibes in December ,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fy8yrt/laidback_beach_vibes_in_december/,14,"Hello fellow travelers! I hope everyone is having a nice October so far. I (29 F) am planning a solo birthday trip in early/mid December, looking to go somewhere warm for 1 week. I was hoping to get some insight on recommendations for the below:

- not too far from the US midwest due to the short amount of time (ideally no more than one layover if possible, but from my home airport that’s not always realistic so I’m open to anything within reason) 

- relatively easy to get around without a car (I have my motorcycle license and experience driving scooters abroad, renting a moto and/or walking is preferred)

- vegan options aplenty 

- laid-back, beach town vibe with nearby nature to explore and an ocean to swim in. I love hiking, snorkeling, whale-watching, swimming, etc. but I’m not big on adventure sports (I have a significant fear of falling)  

- budget to mid-range affordability, I’d love to spend less than $100 USD per day on food and activities and less than $100 USD per night for accommodation would be ideal 

- good for solo travelers to meet other people. I’m not a partier by any means and would prefer to stay in a hostel private room. Ideally, I’d stay somewhere quiet at night so that I can wake up early and explore (perhaps with some new friends)

- not Mexico, I have been a fair few times all around the coast and would love to go somewhere new

My initial thought was Puerto Vierjo on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica but I know it might be a bit rainy. Not sure if anyone can speak on this? Planning is one of my favorite things about travel, but I’d love any and all suggestions from other seasoned travelers as a jumping off point. Thank you in advance! ",2024-10-07 14:27:33
solotravel,1fy6obi,Nairobi airport to hotel transfer solo female traveller,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fy6obi/nairobi_airport_to_hotel_transfer_solo_female/,16,"Good morning,
I will travel to Kenya for 2 weeks with a cooperative-volunteer association. The thing is I will arrive by myself at Nairobi Airport at 22:00h, but the program starts the next day at 6:00, so I have to go to the hotel until then.
My association told me that taxi or uber are safe there but I would like to hear about other solo travellers experience doing a transfer from the airport to hotels, is it better to book a private transfer? Can you recomend me a reliable company? Did you have any bad experiences in the airport? 
I was going to take an uber but my family is worried because I will arrive at night as an alone female.
After that I wil be with people the rest of the travel 😊
Thanks in advance",2024-10-07 12:42:46
solotravel,1fxk6xv,"First Solo Travel: Bored, Depressed, and Underwhelmed",163,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fxk6xv/first_solo_travel_bored_depressed_and_underwhelmed/,160,"


I'm on my last 4 days of my first solo travel, 7 days in Buenos Aires, 5 days in Ushuaia, and back to Buenos Aires for 3 more days. I'm 21, male, and from Puerto Rico, I speak english and spanish and so I can connect with locals and tourists like me.

I don't know how much is to blame on the destination, my lack of proper planning, outside/unrelated issues in my personal life, or all of the above, here goes:

The main reason for the trip was a concert, but in general I've been interested in Argentina and I've never been to any even slightly cold place (let alone see snow), so that was the reason for Ushuaia.

Besides the flights and airbnbs, I booked nothing in advance. Everyday I wake up and just plan something lightly for the next 2-3 days. In BA I did a city tour, a food tour, went to lots of restaurants, and walked around a bit. On the tours, it was small groups and nobody was under 35, most being 50+. I'm struggling to find people my age, and even if I do see them in parks or the street, they're usually with a group or their partners, and it would be awkward for me to approach.

I've found the food to be just alright, the prices are seemingly normal in comparison to PR, and I've been feeling a bit sick, lack of apetite. I've found myself going to a restaurant, then heading back to the airbnb and just rotting away on my phone for 5+ hours until I decide I'm hungry enough again to repeat.

Ushuaia has been much better, as the cold weather really excites since it's new for me. The tours/excursions have been great, I got to hike through a snowy forest, been on catamarans, and stepped on an island to see penguins real up close. Thats made up for the lack of connection and other things to do that I felt in BA.

I planned the trip like 4-5 months in advance, and a lot happened in that time frame. I quit my 3 year job and bought an apartment back home in Puerto Rico, I just moved in like a week before the trip, so the trip came in at an awkward time in a transitional period in my life. I'm dealing with some depression, moodswings, and very low self esteem to put it lightly. I've barely stepped out of my comfort zone, and have made 0 connections or conversations that have lasted longer than a fex exchanges back and forth. I'm also stressing about some finances and new home owner issues, and it's affecting the way I feel about spending here.

I don't think solo travel is for me, or atleast in my specific situation :(",2024-10-06 16:17:16
solotravel,1fxo1dn,Trip report: 9 days in Azerbaijan,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fxo1dn/trip_report_9_days_in_azerbaijan/,30,"I've searched r/solotravel and couldn't find many reports from Azerbaijan, so I figured I'd share my experience. It's a bit long, apologies in advance, feel free to skim parts that bore you.

**Baku**

Accommodation: I stayed in Flora Art Hostel, which was the only cheap option I found on booking or hostelworld that didn't have a complaint about the bathroom. Nice room with A/C, lockers, comfortable enough beds, clean. Most of the staff didn't speak English, but the one who did was friendly and helpful as much as he could. Overall, the staff wasn't as present as I would have liked, I was hoping to get recommendations from them. Also, I didn't see any women staying here, which seems pretty typical in Azerbaijan. Most of the clientele were laborers staying here either from elsewhere in Azerbaijan or countries nearby. One Algerian tourist, one British, one German. Mostly it was pretty empty. Overall would recommend, especially because of the events I talk about on days 2 and 3. They also have a nice open air courtyard/cafe I enjoyed sitting in.

Day 1: Arrived 5am. Took the airport bus to Baku which should have cost 1.3 monat, but the ATM gave me a 100 bill and they didn't have change (and didn't take card). A kind Azerbaijani man paid for me. The same thing happened more or less on the bus inside the city.

After settling in and showering I decided to try to stay awake, so I quickly booked a ""free"" walking tour. The tour of the old city was nice, though the guide was uninspiring. They upsold me on the ""new city"" which was basically just a tour of Highland Park. This wasn't worth it, about half of the tour we sat waiting for the funicular to go down to the boardwalk. (At the bottom of the funicular I bought some cherries from a guy hawking them. Not only were they overpriced and half rotten, the bowl had a false bottom. Caveat emptor.) On the plus side, I was planning to tip the guide almost the full price of the upsell, so it worked out okay.

After the tour I went for lunch and then met up with a bumble date. She turned out to be an escort and was not at all happy I wasn't going to pay her, but she helped me buy a few things I needed which was nice, before she left in a huff. I went out for dinner with friends and drank a bit too much.

Day 2: Slept in, got food with the same friends, took a nap that ended up being 4 hours (probably because I pushed myself too hard the day before), chilled in the hostel. While sitting in the courtyard, the owner came up to me and told me they organized a beach party that night and it was free for hostel guests. So that's exactly what I did.

On the bus to the party, I made friends with a woman who spoke English and Spanish and hung out with her and her friends all night (even after she passed out early from drinking too much). They were very friendly despite our language barriers and we made it work. The first 2-3 hours were just chill while some local bands played. Then a DJ started and everyone danced. They tried to teach me to dance like an Azeri, which was sweet, but I'm a trash dancer to begin with. At 5 the music ended and they started a giant game of mafia which is apparently a thing here? The bus back was in an hour, but a bolt was cheap, it was late, and I'd had enough, so I called it a night.

Day 3: Slept in until noon, spent most of the day in pursuit of food, laundry, and planning the rest of my week. I returned to the hostel around 8pm from doing laundry and grabbing food and there was a concert happening in the courtyard, which was actually great. I sat in the back and continued to make plans for myself. About 10pm I discovered I could still make it to Ganja, my next stop, on the 11:30 bus so I booked it to the bus station. The website said the bus filled up while I was in my bolt ride (it wasn't clear if I would make it in time, so I was waiting to buy the ticket), but I was still able to buy a ticket at the bus station for only a few extra monat. And of course the bus left half an hour late anyway.

**Ganja**

Accommodations: Stayed at Huseyn House as it seemed the better of the two cheap options on booking.com. The room was fine, had A/C, a decent bed. It was a 4 person room, though only two of us were staying there; for two it was comfortable, for 4 it would have been cramped. They very graciously let me in to the hostel at 6 am when I arrived. They later charged me for that first ""night"". Make of that what you will.

Overall impression: Ganja is skippable. Poor tourist infrastructure, not much information in any language. The main attractions of lakes Goygol and Maralgol were overrated and a let down. All the museums and buildings I tried to enter were closed which didn't help (maybe it's the off season? IDK.)

Day 4: I arrived in Ganja around 5:30 AM. I almost immediately realized that I'd forgot my glasses on the bus after taking them off to sleep (I had to get off in a hurry). My taxi driver says no problem, we'll catch them. He starts racing: speeding, drifting, tires screeching, swerving, slamming on the breaks (even though the streets were empty, he stopped at every red light, go figure). My first high speed chase. And we're doing it in an old (post) soviet Lada. No seatbelts. Finally I see the bus. It's pulled over waiting for us, the bus driver is having a smoke. I grab my glasses and we leave. On the drive to my hostel, I learn that this is just how my driver drives. Once I checked in, I decided to take a quick nap, but instead I slept through my alarms.

I woke up around noon. and shortly thereafter set off to wander around Ganja. It's a cool city with lots of interesting old and modern buildings. I explored the buildings around the main square, though the main museums there were closed for unspecified reasons. I explored a couple shopping streets which I always find interesting in foreign countries. I wandered over to the puppet theater housed in an old Lutheran church which was, again, closed. From there I took a bolt to the Imamzadeh Mausoleum. This was a beautiful old mosque, important to Shia Islam, but overall it's a quick visit. Then I took a bolt to Nazami's grave, he was a 12th century poet who lived nearby. (It was my same bolt driver, he had waited for me, and he offered to just drive me for the day. I agreed, but this turned out to be a mistake. Bolts are cheap and plentiful and you don't have to worry about how long you spend in any given location.) The grave itself was interesting, but again a quick visit. While visiting the grave, a tour guide walked in and offered to tell me about him in English which was nice. Seeing the wild pomegranate growing nearby as I walked out afterward was cool too, though sadly they weren't quite ripe. The museum across the street was interesting (and free), it's full of artistic depictions of Nazami's work, though most of them were from this century. Then my driver took me to Heyder Aliyev park. It's a cute park to wander around, but I was early. It seems it really comes alive at night in the summers. It would have been great to people watch. (What I should have done was gone to the Khan's garden here, chilled an hour or two, then gone to the park. Hindsight 20/20 and all.) Behind the park was my favorite part of Ganja, called Gencland. It's this old soviet/post soviet amusement park, filled with huge behemoth rides and turn of the 21st century Disney copyright infringement. Very cool to see. Again, I wish I was there an hour later. As I was leaving it seemed to really be coming alive. And it seems the prices are reasonable too, at least for a ""rich"" foreigner, I  would have loved to try some of the rides (they only operate with a minimum number of people and were just starting to run). From there I took a bolt to the village of the woman from Saturday night, the one who spoke English and Spanish, she'd gone home for a visit. She promised me some tea at her mom's and instead they tried to feast me. The whole thing was quite sweet. It was great to see her home and meet her family, and she graciously translated for me. In addition to everything else, they had a fig tree and fed me some fresh figs that were quite perfect.

After a few hours, I took a bolt back to the guest house. As I was getting ready for bed, the other patron (an Azerbaijani soldier who lived in Baku, but was stationed in Ganja) asked if I would talk to his daughter on Whatsapp so she could practice her English. I was happy to oblige with a short conversation, before calling my own parents. Once I hung up on them, the soldier insisted I video call his daughter again. I'm not sure what he expected me to talk with his 11 year old daughter about for 15 minutes, but I got through it. Then I went to bed.

Day 5: Through my host, I scheduled a tour to visit Goygol and Maralgol, which, as far as I could tell, are the main attractions of Ganja. They're two lakes about an hour's drive away. I could have gone with my cab driver who chased down the bus for me, but decided I would ""splurge"" on a guide, who turned out to be the guest home owner's son. Honestly, the whole experience was quite underwhelming. The lakes were OK, nothing special (though perhaps that's my PNW privilege, we have a lot of mountain lakes). You couldn't swim in them. And the only way to get from the one to the other was by shuttle (mostly so they could charge you for the shuttle). But you had to wait for enough people for the shuttle to run. Visiting each lake took 5-10 minutes (plus a short hike for the second lake), but waiting for the shuttle was 30 minutes each way. So lots of driving, disappointing attractions, and lots of waiting. Oh well. Also, a guide was completely unnecessary, very self explanatory once I arrived. Once we returned from the lakes, I visited the Khan's garden, which was my favorite thing I did in Ganja. Beautiful little park right in the middle of the city, created by one of the 17th or 18th century Khans. It would be a great place to just sit and chill out for an hour, maybe eat or read. There were some cafes. After that I returned to my hostel, packed up my stuff, and headed to Sheki.

**Sheki**

Accommodations: I stayed in Central hostel which I *really* wanted to like. It's clearly been redone recently and they put a lot of effort into the rooms. But the wifi sucked, the kitchen was useless beyond a microwave and a kettle for tea, the floors were weirdly uneven and I tripped often, the bunk bed was extremely uncomfortable to climb in and out of (I scraped my shin every time), and the ""luggage storage"" consisted of tiny cubbies in the main entryway, zero security. The worst thing though was the staff getting extremely upset that I used the kitchen to eat lunch after checkout. I've never had a hostel upset over that before. There's another hostel nearby, Canal hostel, I recommend checking it out.

Overall impressions: Sheki was worth a visit. The town itself was cool to visit and fun to wander around with some good sites. Definitely recommend as a stop in Azerbaijan. A lot of people visit on their way to the land border crossing with Georgia.

Day 6: I headed out with another guy from my hostel to Kish. We were planning to take the bus, but a taxi driver accosted us and the price was reasonable enough so we took it. He dropped us off at the entrance to the village though, instead of taking us to our destination which was annoying, because I think the bus would have taken us straight there. Our first stop was the old ""Armenian"" monastery. It was a cute visit. My impression is that it's typical of old churches in the area, though it's the only one I visited. From there they called us a cab which took us to the entrance to the Galarsan-Gorarsan fortress. The local driver got us further down the dirt road than a bolt would have taken us, which was nice. It was a short, steep hike up to the fortress. I climbed around the fortress a bit, it's always fun to climb over ancient walls and there were some nice views into the valley below. It was steep and bit too sketchy for my companion, who didn't have hiking shoes. We hiked out, stopping to buy some snacks and water at the resort. Here we split up, he hitched a ride to Kish, and I followed my topographical map and cut across to my hike.

The hike is from Kish to Bash Goynuk. I'm an experienced hiker and this was a tough hike. Straight uphill, overgrown with thorns, hard to navigate. I lost the trail at least twice and had to bushwack my way back. On the plus side, it was blackberry season and I had a nice snack. On the down side, so many thorns. I also ate these small, bitter, red stone fruits that I'd seen in the markets that lined the trail. I think they're mainly use for jam, but they were fine, and the overripe ones were so sweet and delicious. There are some decent views at the top, but I should have turned around instead of finishing it. The middle section between the two ""peaks"" was just absolutely covered in blackberry thistles. Very slow going, not fun at all. And I came out the other side a couple hundred feet lower than I should have and was forced to bushwack straight up the steep hill to get back on trail. To make matters worse, I completely missed the spring on the second peek, which is the one water source on the hike, but wasn't marked on my map. About a kilometer past it I saw a sign telling me it was a kilometer back, and it was too late in the day to allow an extra 2km. I pressed on hoping for the best. About an hour later I came across some cattle ranchers and asked them for water. They gave me some chai. I also filled up some water from their hose, it was very brown and I did not want to drink it. As it was late, they invited me to sleep there, but I declined and headed down the mountain. On the way down I finally found a stream, which I'm sure was filled with cow shit, but at least it wasn't so brown, so I finally had enough to drink. (To be clear, I filtered the water.) As I continued to hike out, it got nice and dark, and I stopped several times to stargaze--one of my favorite activities--which was lovely. Overall, the hike took me about 8 hours of hiking, while I'd budgeted 5-6. I arrived in Bash Goynuk and found someone to call me a cab. I had asked if there was a cab in town, but it turned out they called one from Sheki to come get me, so I ended up waiting there an hour. In retrospect, I probably would have been better walking/hitchhiking down to the highway and figuring out a ride from there (I probably could have gotten a bolt). Once I finally arrived back at my hostel, of course the kitchen was closed and they wouldn't open it, so I just ate some snacks and went to bed.

Day 7: I slept in, cooked some lunch (slowly), and then headed out to explore Sheki. [This website](https://wander-lush.org/sheki-azerbaijan-guide/) was my main guide. I don't have much to add to it, except to say that the ""winter palace"" has one decorated room and wasn't really worth the visit. Everything else was nice. At the end of my day exploring Sheki, I took a bus from the Khan's palace to the bazaar. I missed the part of the description where the bazaar is only open during the daytime, so most everything was closed. It was also more just like an outdoor marketplace than I was picturing. Anyway, I bought a giant watermelon for 1.8 monat and headed back to my hostel. After consuming said watermelon, I decided to try the wine bar listed at the link to try their pomegranate wine. The woman at the table next to me was talking loudly in English on the phone (Americans, amiright?) and once she finally hung up, I struck up a conversation and we chatted over wine for a couple hours. She was, I believe, the only American tourist I met in Azerbaijan. On my way back to my hostel, I decided to stop at the WWII memorial, which was a bit underwhelming, probably best not to visit at night.

Day 8: I decided to hike Khan's Pasteur above Sheki. I took a taxi as close to the start of the trail as I could. The trail was fairly well marked and maintained, just be sure you don't accidentally miss the early turn off and end up on the waterfall trail instead. For the final ascent, the trail on my gps circumvents the mountain and then doubles back for the peak, but there were signposts indicating I could just scramble straight up, so that's what I did. It was steep and not a clear trail, but I made it. The view from the top was great. I then followed the normal trail down to the intersection. There's a half kilometer extension past the turn off which I attempted to follow, but there were shepherd dogs barking viciously at me, so I decided against it. I had been warned to avoid shepherd dogs as they can be quite aggressive. (Eventually I met the shepherd who asked me why I had turned around and then laughed when I answered, so who knows.) I followed the branch of the trail down to Kish instead of back to Sheki since it was shorter and I was in a time crunch. This was a mistake as there's now a fence with a locked gate blocking the trail. I tried circumventing the fence, but it was a bushwack through a forest and I had no idea how far it went, so I doubled back and hopped the gate, cutting my arm a bit in the process. (I now believe that I could have probably followed the fence all the way around the resort, but I didn't know that at the time, and it's definitely a bit of a rough forest walk.) I couldn't get a bolt, but I found a taxi dropping someone off and got a ride back to Sheki. He also stopped for me to get some baklava to take with me. (It was too sweet and honey-saturated for me, I ended up throwing most of it away.) I caught the bus back to Baku, stayed at my old hostel, and met some friends for dinner.

**Baku again**

Day 9: I decided to do the classic Baku tour of Gobustan, Mud Volcanoes, Fire Temple, and the Burning mountain. I booked it the night before on get your guide for $14 (half off the ""official"" price at the time, though I'm looking now and it seems even cheaper, probably fewer tourists). It was nice, the guide was great. A lot of driving for relatively little time at the sites, but still, a good day. I made friends with some people on the tour and got dinner with one them that night.

Day 10: Flew to Georgia.

General notes:

- I didn't talk about food much as it's a pretty typical meat and bread society, neither of which I eat. Food was overall difficult, but I managed. Shoutout to Manipura, the only vegan restaurant in the country as far as HappyCow is concerned.

- There are *a lot* of Russians in Azerbaijan. They're the main tourists. (There's also apparently a parallel Russian expat/refuge community living there that doesn't socially interact much with the locals.) This was honestly kind of jarring at first with the war going on, but from talking to a few, it seems like life is just continuing as normal in Russia, at least in the rich parts. One told me ""It's like Israel and Palestine. Or if America went to war with Mexico."" Almost everyone in Azerbaijan speaks some Russian and it would have been extremely useful. Very few people speak English, even the young people don't speak much (in contrast to many other countries I've been to, where they tend to do so).

- I felt extremely safe everywhere and heard the same from a female solo traveler I met as well. At the beach party I asked the friends I made if it was OK to just leave their purses unattended while we danced and they were completely unphased.

- In Baku, Google maps works well for the actual bus routes, less well for timing. I almost always waited far longer than anticipated for the correct bus. I probably should have bolted more, it's dirt cheap, but I prefer public transit when I  can. In Sheki, the buses have signs telling you their main stops which was super helpful. I didn't try it at all in Ganja.

- Bolt is the main taxi app in Azerbaijan. Don't cancel bolts. I cancelled a few of them because the driver asked for more money or wasn't in the correct car. After some number of cancelations (I'm not sure how many), they temporarily freeze your account, which twice left me stranded. Instead you're supposed to contact bolt and have them cancel it or wait for the driver to do so.

- Outside of Baku, there are lots of memorials to dead soldiers everywhere. It's honestly a bit weird. All over the cities and roads.

- Drivers here are crazy. Wear a seatbelt. In 10 days in the country, I got rearended in my taxi, fortunately not badly.

- About half the card readers in the country couldn't take either of my visa cards. Carry cash. Maybe a mastercard or something would work better, no idea. Some places had two separate card readers and one worked while the other didn't, so it's worth asking if they have a second reader.

- The taxi drivers seem extremely honest compared to most countries I've been to. I've never had them try to cheat me or anything. Anytime I ask ""how much?"", it's always been a reasonable price (based on my experience with bolt). And they're usually pretty friendly and happy for the business. I did have a few negative experiences, but that was the exception, not the rule.

Edit: On day 8 I visited Highland park again at night which was well worth it. The views of the city lit up were gorgeous, the fire memorial was much more impactful, and the building next door was lit up with pictures. I'll also add that a different night I went to the top of the Hilton which was also a gorgeous view. They have two floors with bars, the higher one, which is outdoors, was the better of the two. You can get a drink and sit down, but I just told them I was there for the view and they let me be. I actually went twice, once during the day and once at night, both great views and worth a visit.",2024-10-06 19:02:46

My ideal trip would include hiking through mountains and spending time in nature, exploring medieval towns and villages, visiting Christmas markets (if they’re open), and experiencing the local cuisine and pub culture. If the weather allows, I’d love to do some bike-riding, though I know November is not ideal for that, and I’m fine with that. I understand the weather will vary in each country, but I’m not deterred by cold, overcast skies, or rain — Autumn is my favorite season, after all!

After a bit of reading, I impulsively bought flight tickets to Thailand and can't wait!

I composed the following itinerary while keeping in mind:

* I don't like to rush too much, prefer to take it slower, and leave some room for serendipity—though I want to book some flights already.
* I will skip the Gulf islands, as November is supposedly bad (monsoon season).
* I am a 29M from Belgium, and I like good food, socializing (will mainly stay in hostels), balancing culture with some nightlife, and would like to surf, scuba dive, and do a few hikes.

Does the following seem feasible and not too packed, or should I maybe add a stop?

solotravel,1fwzklb,Solo on a Cruise and some unpleasant encounters,255,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fwzklb/solo_on_a_cruise_and_some_unpleasant_encounters/,191,"Hi, I just need to get some thoughts off my chest and maybe you have some ideas.

I am currently on a wonderful cruise in the Mediterranean and am looking at various destinations in Spain, Italy and France.
Although this is the 5th time I've been on a cruise alone, it's never seemed so bad.

Starting with the crew, who make me feel guilty every time I visit a restaurant and just want to get rid of me quickly. For example, they sit me at extra-large tables (without seating others, the queue fills up), make derogatory comments, constantly ask (every 3 minutes) if everything is okay or deliver my main course/dessert even though I haven't finished the previous course yet.

I find it highly unprofessional that the same looks and whispering come from the crew as well as derogatory looks from other passengers...

I have already experienced several times this trip how other passengers have obviously made fun of me.
In one situation, an older couple didn't like the fact that I took the free lounger next to them. They whispered something, looked in my direction and shook their heads.
An hour later, 3 middle-aged women (they were about 15 meters away) said audibly to me ""the man with the cap back there"" and then continued talking and looking in my direction, no longer audible to me. I was lying facing the pool and I think they thought I was either chasing some women or taking photos. I had my eyes closed most of the time (but sunglasses on) and was occasionally looking at my phone to answer messages or turn on the next podcast episode.

As a man in my late 20s, traveling alone and somewhat corpulent, I've always felt under general suspicion anyway and have gotten into the habit of doing a few things, e.g. not walking up/down the stairs behind women or holding my phone almost horizontally and usually covering the camera with my hand so that no one feels harassed by me. And even though I do that and want to be considerate of everyone, I still get this hate.

A third situation was in a corridor to a location that was about to open. I was about the 7th person in line, after me came a family (mother, father and daughter in their early 20s). Other passengers then joined the queue. The daughter stood less than 2 meters away from me and stared at me for minutes, then whispered something quietly in her mother's ear, whereupon the mother also looked at me and shortly afterwards did the same with the father.

Unfortunately, I was too tense in this situation to simply ask what was so interesting...


I don't think I'm imagining these situations. The situations with the blasphemy were particularly obvious.

I think it's such a shame that this happens. I love going on cruises. Should I stop this great type of vacation now just because my girlfriend isn't enthusiastic about it and I don't have anyone else I'd like to go on vacation with?

Do you have any tips?
What do you do in situations like this?

Thank you for reading this (unexpectedly long) post.",2024-10-05 20:28:54
solotravel,1fxi6o9,6 months in Central America - budget/itinerary/tips/advice? ,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fxi6o9/6_months_in_central_america/,12,"Hi all! I’ve seen a few posts about budgeting for central and South America, but wanted to focus on Central America more specifically. I’m heading over at the end of next year, and if I can save enough over the next year, ideally want to quit my job and try and make it atleast 6 months. 

My rough itinerary is as follows:
- Costa Rica for 10 days (planned trip with a friend, I’ll then be continuing on and friend leaving) 
- Panama for about 8 days
- boat trip from Panama to Colombia
- colombia for 2-3 weeks
- fly Bogotá to Mexico City
- Mexico for 30 days
- Belize for a week or so
- Guatemala for 3 weeks
- Honduras for 1-2 weeks
- El Salvador for 1-2 weeks
- Nicaragua for 3-4 weeks
- then back to Costa Rica before heading home/next destination 

Times are a rough guide for places id like to visit, and I’d like to mix in some volunteering/WorldPackers type stops into the mix to stretch things out further. (I’m thinking a week or two in one place every couple of weeks will be a good way to regroup myself also)

With a few big ticket items into consideration (the Panama to Colombia boat trip, would like to do Lost City Trek in Colombia, a volcano hike or two, and a week at a surf camp in Nicaragua), I’m thinking $10-15 grand AUD should suffice as a minimum, then anything I can save on top of that as a buffer. 

Please let me know your thoughts, tips or comments about budget, itinerary, must do things, experiences - literally anything!! This trip is a long time coming so want to make sure I’m doing it right! :) ",2024-10-06 14:49:39

I will try and make this short. So I am thinking about graduating college a year early (USA) and taking a gap year before heading to nursing school. I want to spend anywhere from 3-7 or 8 months backpacking SE Asia during this. 

I have some decent travel experience, I solo backpacked Northern Thailand for just 8 days before flying to Bhutan for a month (this was 2 years ago), and I spent the last summer living in Ireland alone and took a 8 day trip to Poland and Prague.

  
As per Route what I would like to do is fly to Tokyo (would hopefully stay with my college roommates family) then Vietnam > Cambodia > Laos > Thailand > Malaysia (this part hopefully all without flights, let me know if this is a bad idea) > Indonesia (would love to go to Borneo and Komodo). I plan to spend 3-4 months on this route. Assuming this all goes smoothly and I still have time (and money) I have interest in flying to Nepal from Kuala Lumpar and then travelling down and ending in Sri Lanka, hopefully also all overland. 

So what do yall think? How feasible is my route overland? Is my time frame of 3-4 months for the SE Asia part too short? Do you think I could do all of this for about 10k? Let me know thoughts, tips, cautions, pretty much anything! This is my first post on reddit ever so looking forward to hearing from yall. ",2024-10-05 22:21:43

solotravel,1fx4rd1,Seeking Travel Advice for Italy Trip!,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fx4rd1/seeking_travel_advice_for_italy_trip/,7,"Hello everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice for my upcoming trip to Italy. Right now, I have half of it planned. I land in Rome on the morning of October 26 and plan to spend two nights there. After that, I’m headed to Orvieto for two nights. While in Orvieto, I’d like to visit Bagnoregio.

I intend to take the train from Rome to Orvieto and stay there. However, I’m unsure about getting to Bagnoregio from Orvieto. Since I’ll be solo for the first half of my trip and relying on public transit (I don’t know any Italian), I’m wondering if it would be complicated to take the bus from Orvieto to Bagnoregio.

I’ll be meeting my parents in Sulmona on Thursday, October 31. Depending on where I am, I can take the train back to Rome, then catch a train from Rome to Sulmona.

My main question is whether it’s worth extending my stay in Rome by one night, making it three nights there before heading to Orvieto for two nights. I find Rome quite expensive compared to other parts of Italy, so I’m debating if it’s really worth it. Is two or three nights in Rome ideal? To be honest, I’m not very interested in museums; I’d rather explore Italian culture, enjoy the food and people, and do some sightseeing. I’m also a huge fan of nature, which is part of why I’m excited to visit Orvieto and Bagnoregio, with its castle and mountain.

Lastly, are there any nearby places worth visiting and staying for one night after my time in Orvieto? I need to make my way to Sulmona afterward.

Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",2024-10-06 00:47:39

I’m 26F going to Vietnam on November 4. Ive travelled internationally quite a bit, but never solo and never with a backpack. I’m flying into Ho Chi Minh and flying out of Hanoi. So I’ll need to make it from south to north in 21 days. This is my current itinerary. frankly I might just book my accommodations for my arrival in Ho Chi Minh and then wing the rest. 

Ho Chi Minh -3 nights.
Dalat-3 nights.
Hoi An-2 nights.
Ninh bing-2 nights.
Lan ha bay-2 nights.
Ha Giang Loop- 3/4 nights.
Hanoi-3 nights.

This only adds up to 18 nights, but I figured it would be nice to have flexibility to add or subtract time in different places. 

What do u all think? Is it too ambitious to do the ha Giang loop? Seems really cool, but a time commitment. What am I missing? I love both city and nature. I’m moderately adventurous. I’ve never driven a motor bike but I think I have potential to be good at it. My budget is loose, not trying to break the bank, but down to splurge where it’s worth it! And I loveeeee to eat!!!

Hakone or Fuji -- if Hakone, would you recommend a ryokan there over Shibu?

Would be doing 3 nights in either Hakone or Fuji and definitely could tack one of those nights onto the Nagano portion if it makes more sense.

I am backpacking with a friend in Eastern Java, Bali, Lombok/Komodo and I will still have ten days left when he returns home (end of October). I would like to see some wildlife and maybe do some jungle trekking etc. and am not sure where exactly I should go. I see the following options:

1. go to a javanese national park (e.g. Ujung Kulon) would be the easiest option but given Java's large population, I am not sure how ""wild"" these national parks really are and whether or not they are good for getting the real jungle experience?

2. taking a ferry to southern Sumatra and going to Way Kambas or Bukit Barisan. They seem very wild but I cannot really find many details about them online and I am not sure what activities are possible or how the tourism infrastructure is like there. Has anyone been there? 

3. taking a flight to Tanjung Puting on Kalimantan and taking a Boat ride through the national park. Everybody seems to be very happy with the visit there. But I am not sure if it is easily doable as a solotraveler because it seems like the boats are usually for private groups, which means double the price (roughly 650€) for a single person. Has anyone been there as a solotraveler? How are the chances to find other solotravelers there to share a boat? Is early November already rainy season, I have read different definitions for dry and rainy season in southern Kalimantan (probably because it's a huge area)?

4. going to northern Sumatra (e g. Bukit Lawang or Ketambe), where I've already been to in 2017 and had an awesome time. The only issue with this option is that it is rather far away from where I am prior (Eastern Java) or from where I am flying back (Jakarta) and it is very close to Singapore, so would make more sense logistically to save it for another trip to SEA.

I've never left my home Country of Australia (technically I've never left my state), especially by myself so I'm both terrified and excited.

I'd like to go to Germany, Sweden and Romania as well as most of the Asian countries if I can afford it. They all have really beautiful buildings and history (except for the Hitler arc but we won't talk about that) that I would just love to experience. History has always been something I've loved and I'm really excited to go to all the different museums and explore all the different cultures of the world.

I've saved up around $10,000 AUD and it's what I currently have but will likely have more by the time I end up flying sometime next year too (plus I can most likely sell some stuff too) so while it's decent, it's a pretty shoestring budget and I'm more than prepared to accommodate that.

I'm currently going through the process of getting my passport and it's a bit of a hassle but I'm getting there. I'm not sure if I need any sort of shots or whatnot, I guess it depends on the countries, but what are some things you'd suggest? Also I'm allowed to travel to Europe for 90 days visa-free but is it worth actually getting one or would you suggest country hopping instead?

I've been studying cinematography in my free time and I'd like to document my travels for archival purposes, so I'd likely not be packing as light I'd like, is there any tips and tricks you'd recommend to help accommodate that and maybe even some theft prevention tips?

And just any overall general advice? I just recently got dumped and so this trip will be more of a soul searching journey for me, trying to find out who I am and who I want to be, etc. I'm quite introverted as well so I'd like to try and get out of my comfort zone as much as I can.

As well, for all the other non-cis individuals here, is there anything specific I should know or look out for? Apart from the general stuff.

I am thinking of either going to Central or South East Asia. Here are some points:

• I want to spend 2-3 months exploring and I have a budget of 2-3k€ outside of the first and last flight to my home country (Cyprus)
• I would want to visit about 4 countries so either Kazakhstan-Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan or about 4 of the following Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore(~2days)-Cambodia(Visa required)-Vietnam(Visa required)-Phillipines
• I mostly want to see the nature-nation parks-canyons--temples-sightseeing and adventure in general but a good nightlife would be a plus
• I am a 22 year old male
• I speak some Russian so it would be easier to communicate in Central Asia.
• I own an EU and Russian passport
• I don't mind staying in hostels as long as they at least 3/10 in terms of cleanliness 
• I have traveled a lot in Europe mostly with friends but I always organized everything
• Safety is important and mum is also scared so any advise on how to calm her nerves would be appreciated.


My main questions are:

• Since a lot of staff I would want to visit are outside of the capital that the main airports are usually located what would be the best way of travel considering that a lot of staff are outside of any cities in general? For example I see many people renting Muppets for Thailand and Vietnam would that be a good idea and I guess you would have to return the mopped in the same place you got it from so going from the North to the South of Vietnam you would have to return back to the North to return the mopped, correct?
• I think bus routes on Google maps are generally unreliable for these areas, so what would be the best way of knowing what bus or train to take to go to another location etc?
• In case of needing a visa to travel, since this countries don't have an embassy in mine would it be possible for something to go wrong during my e-visa application that would require me to visit an embassy. Also should I apply for the visa before or after I book the flight tickets.
• I want to use my EU passport but for example Vietnam doesn't require a visa for Russian passports. Would it be a good idea to present different passports for each country or would that cause some trouble with immigration.

I am sorry for the long post but any advise or helping me choose a destination would be appreciated.",2024-10-05 16:23:53

solotravel,1fvkrnu,Racism while traveling,773,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fvkrnu/racism_while_traveling/,257,"Earlier a black women made a post regarding racism while travelling particularly from tourists. Many comments were either gaslighting her or denying her experience.

I'm also a black woman and I'm also not American. I have visited countries on every continents except Antartica. I have travelled with white schoolmates, I have traveled with friends, with family, with diverse groups and solo. I have encountered intolerance and ignorance from locals at time, but the worse racism is often from other tourists. Whether it's casual racism from ignorance to straight up racism. When you travel with friends or family, it's easier to get ""over it"" because you have someone to debrief the situation. When you travel alone it's something else because you don't have a support system and you live those experiences alone and have to cope. It kind of ruin the experience...

The racism is not necessarily toward me, as I have heard in the past, ""because I'm not like other black people"" but it's toward the staff, locals or anybody working in the tourism industry. It's the always thinking everyone is trying to scam, everyone is trying to steal from you and it's the blatant disregard for local customs and downgrading other ways of life. The racism might not be directed to me but it's directed to people who like me. We hear the racist jokes and the remarks that are on the border of racism. And when you solo travels, well it sucks and prevents you from creating relationships and befriending people, in other words, it excludes you.

I loved solo traveling, it was such an amazing experience and I am so grateful to have live this experience. Especially visiting many countries, meeting so many people and traveling for multiple weeks. I am bless to have live those experience and I always encouraged other black women to go explore the world even if they are scared of the racism. However, as a traveling community we ought to have those discussion and we owe each other to do better.",2024-10-03 22:58:58

I have a question about which of these 2 destinations I should include in my upcoming trip. I had initially planned Vang Vieng but now I'm wondering if I should skip that in the Laos portion of my trip and use the days to check out Koh Rong in Cambodia instead. 

As of now the itinerary of my trip goes Kuala Lumpur -> Bangkok -> Vientiane -> Vang Vieng -> Luang Prabang -> Siem Reap -> Phnom Penh -> Singapore 

I've been to Malaysia and Thailand before so I'm not really trying to add destinations in either of those countries and have included them just for ease of logistics. If I cut out Vang Vieng, I'd just go from Luang Prabang to Siem Reap a few days earlier and then add those extra days to Koh Rong before going to Phmon Penh.

I'm basically looking to chill, hopefully meet and hang out with other travelers and indulge in a few parties here and there but not get into anything ridiculous. I'm into my 30s now so ideally I'd prefer a location that's not overrun by teenagers. I looked at the river tubing in Vang Vieng which seemed fun and is what initially attracted me to the place. However, I realized my itinerary is missing a beach destination which got me thinking about Koh Rong. Will be staying in hostels everywhere if that matters.

Just curious if people have experiences of one location or both and if you have preferences one way or the other.

Thanks in advance!",2024-10-04 15:51:04

Looking forward to a solo climbing trip in November and December. I was leaning heavily towards France, but have realized there are few hostel options in Southern France. 

I'd prefer not to rent a car, but will if I have to.  
Would like to stay in an area with sport climbers and boulderers.   
Which means I'd need to find a hostel close to crags and outdoor areas, or stay in a city with a social climbing gym where I can meet other climbers (very open to both options).

Any recommendations for hostels, campgrounds, cities or crags that rocked?

I am talking, African countries, South America, Southeast Asia.

People keep saying those countries are so cheap (well maybe not African countries) but I am starting to wonder if it is only cheap if you accept to stay in dubious conditions and if you want to stay in clean places you will pay western world prices or you simply don't find clean places. I've been to Bulgaria recently and while it is a first world European country it is apparently considered a developing country (had no idea, read about some classification online). I was expecting for half the price I paid in more expensive destinations I'd get the same level of cleaniness but doesn't work like that. Places for those prices are dirty can attract shady people but the worst is they have misleading high scores. So here I was booking a cheap 8.6/10 place all happy thinking I found an unicorn and when I get there it is actually a 4 in a good day (probably the only day of the week where a cleaning person goes there lol). I ended up spending as much per night as I'd spend in Croatia or Greece except I'd get private rooms or full apartments instead of a dorm (which I really didn't need, because I travel solo, but it was the only option to get a decent place).

I don't understand how people running places with high rotation of guests don't take precautions to prevent for example bed bug infestations. And they didn't learn anything from the covid-19 pandemic apparently. Like it is not enough to wash the sheets, you need to clean daily, if possible more than once, vaccum the mattresses and corners of the rooms and fumigate once in a while. 

Anyway, if this is the case in an European country I wonder how it is elsewhere. I would like to travel to other cultures, but cleaniness I came to learn, is really an issue for me. 

What tricks do you use? Like do you take some desinfectant or something? Where do you book accomodations? Should you completely avoid hostels in those countries? And do you take other precautions to prevent diseases? What type of things would you pack for that? ",2024-10-05 21:10:40

I (22M from the US) am planning a trip for June and July of 2025. Below I have a rough route that I am considering. Starting in Hanoi and working my way south. 

My plan isn’t extremely detailed yet, but roughly the plan is as follows.
Hanoi> Vientiane > Chang Mai/Pai > Bankok. 
From there either over to Cambodia and HCMC or skip that and go straight to Phuket. 
From there I’d like 10 or so days island hopping in Thailand, then Malaysia (if I have time), Singapore, then Bali, then home. 
Along the way I’d like to know of any interesting places to visit. 

Are there any weather considerations? I don’t mind heat and the occasional rain. 

Is this too ambitious for only 2 months here? If so- which places should I prioritize? 
I want a balance between having a fun/vacation/ social type of experience , as well as cultural, architectural, and natural exploration. 

Can anyone reccomend any cities along the way to hit? Especially in northern Laos,  anywhere in Malaysia? Northern Indonesia? 
Islands around Phuket (or anywhere in Thailand). 
I’m especially curious to know about any smaller, quieter towns/villages or nature to hit along the way.

Some friends think it cumbersome for my pack and say most places will have something on offer.

I'll be in hostels, Workaway situations, camping, all sorts.

Because of this, I was thinking one of the enclosed pop-ups could be a nice option for huts/hostels that can then double as an airy tent for camping.

I am planning on combining an intrepid trip in through the Baltics with a completely solo trip (mostly on trains)  through Scandinavia, then I will be going to the UK to visit family.

I am trying to choose between these two intrepid trips:

1. [https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nz/estonia/classic-baltics-160608#Dates-&-availabilities](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nz/estonia/classic-baltics-160608#Dates-&-availabilities) - this is 8 days, starts  Vilnius ends Tallinn
2. [https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nz/lithuania/baltic-experience-160474#Dates-&-availabilities](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nz/lithuania/baltic-experience-160474#Dates-&-availabilities) - 12 days, starts Tallinn ends Vilnius

My plan for Scandinavia trip is Helsinki - Stockholm ferry, then trains Stockholm - Oslo - Bergen - Gothenburg - Copenhagen, staying 2-3 days in each city. Alternatively I might go Stockholm -  Trondheim train, then do a Hurtigruten cruise to Bergen. Does anyone have experience with Hurtigruten? I've not been on a cruise but my experience is when they visit NZ,  it's all retired Americans and drunk English gap year bros - is Hurtigruten the same?

Here  is my question - which order do people think is better to do it in? I could either fly from my home country (New Zealand) into Copenhagen and do Scandinavia, then do the Tallinn - Vilnius tour, then back to London via Poland/Germany/Belgium. Or I could fly in to Vilnius, start with the Vilnius - Tallinn tour, then do Scandinavia, then Copenhagen - London via Germany / France (or Belgium or the Netherlands - google maps shows like 5 different options).

I will probably stay an extra day or two in the city where I end the tour - what is people's experience with Tallinn and Vilnius, and where would be better to have some more time? I'm not that interested in the nightlife, main interests for me are food / history / nature / kayaking (can anyone recommend a good place for kayaking along my route?).  Also, what do people think is the more interesting trip back to London? I'll probably have 3 or 4 days for that leg of the trip, so I could do some diversions if there is something interesting. I'll have a Eurail pass so extra travel cost is not that big a deal

Other things to consider:

* Will be travelling in either June or July (currently leaning towards June, don't love huge crowds so aiming for shoulder season).
* I only speak English (and some Te Reo). I'll make sure I know the basic hello etc. but I don't have more than that. My understanding is that it is relatively easy to use English in Scandinavia and Germany but not sure about the Baltics or Poland?
* Will stay in hotels with a single room or overnight trains. Not really interested in the hostel experience
* I don't drink alcohol  at all, is this likely to be an issue? People can be dicks about it in the rural parts of NZ/ AUS, is that a universal thing? Any experience with how Intrepid tours are for non-drinkers? My understanding is Intrepid is pretty chill compared to the Contiki pub-crawl hook-up culture (that's definitely not my scene lol), but I don't have personal experience

Open to any comments / recommendations. Thanks heaps and sorry I have so many questions! It's a bit overwhelming to plan",2024-10-03 11:25:24
solotravel,1fvccn8,Places to chill for a few weeks,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fvccn8/places_to_chill_for_a_few_weeks/,22,"Hi! I (29F) am looking at taking a few weeks off in November or December (either before Thanksgiving or between Thanksgiving and XMAS). Coming from NE US which will be cold and dark at that time so looking to go somewhere warmer, not too expensive, relaxing/ active/ with healthy food for 2-3 weeks. Ideally a bit of a backpacker culture and WiFi do I can be productive for a couple hours each day. I don’t want to move around too much but open to moving once. Budget: $100-150/ day, will do shared hostel rooms to stay in that budget and perhaps budget for a nicer hotel for a few days at the end 

Options I’m considering:

Costa Rica: Nosara, Tamarindo, and Santa Teresa all come to mind as potentially hitting the spot with yoga, surfing, cafes, backpacking culture. The downside is that I’ve been to Guanacaste province before, and it’s more on the expensive side (that being said I’m looking for a beach place so not open to the interior of CR for this trip) 

Belize: Caye Caulker sounds like it would hit the spot and the Caribbean is nicer to swim in IMO than the Pacific side. However less hiking and unclear on backpacking culture 

Brazil: Forianopolis / Ilha Grande / Paraty sounds like it might fit the bill and as a bonus bring me to a country I haven’t been before. While I’m wary of Rio and São Paulo it sounds like those other places in Brazil are a little better? Curious about people’s experiences here. I have solo traveled in India and traveled to Morocco which were both challenging places and not relaxing - are these parts of Brazil like that? Or more chill?

Tulum: I love the idea of exploring the cenotes and the ancient ruins plus Mexican food is delicious. However it seems more resort oriented than backpacker friendly and would likely push my budget further than I’d like 

Edit: to clarify I’m looking for a walkable or bike-able vibe - CLOSE to the beach - not a city. In general i have less time than money so willing to “splurge” (e.g. reach the upper limit of my budget) to be where I want to be ",2024-10-03 16:52:35

I speak basic Spanish, but I had no problem getting around. People were really kind to me once I attempted to speak Spanish to them. They are typically shy, but when approached first, they are very friendly.

**Budget:** I consider myself a mid-budget traveler because I prefer not to stay in hostels. I stayed at a hotel and guesthouses, which were still very affordable compared to hotels in other countries. Excluding the flight and accommodation, I spent about CAD$500 (about USD$350) on food, drinks, activities, shopping and transportation

**Trip Length:**  September 20 – 30 (September 20 – 25 in El Salvador and 25 – 30 in Guatemala

**Destination(s):** In El Salvador, I spent 2 days in San Salvador, the capital and 3 days in Santa Ana. In Guatemala, I spent all five days in Antigua.

**Accommodation:** I stayed at a decent hotel and a guesthouse. I was offered couch surfing but my hotel was non-refundable by then.

**Activities:** A lot of hiking... non-stop hiking... which I love but it was a bit tiring at the end. One of the best activities I've ever done is hiking Acatenango volcano, which is a must! I always take a city walking tour on the first day I arrive in a new place to get to know its history, architecture, and culture. I always do the city tour through Guruwalk because it is way cheaper and the money goes directly to the guide

**What Went Right:** Everything! The weather was a bit unpredictable, but even that was perfect because I got to experience the wonders of nature in El Salvador and Guatemala in various weather conditions. I was amazed to learn about the history of El Salvador and hope that its tourism revitalized. People still don't walk at night (or don't walk outside at all), but I felt completely safe as a solo female traveler, even walking at 11 p.m. for a quick food run to the city centro. I did get stared at frequently because there aren't many tourists in the country yet, but I am used to it, so it didn't really bother me. I've met some of the best people in my life in El Salvador and Guatemala (locals) and I am sooo grateful for these encounters! Don't be shy and just approach them first, say hola. They are really lovely and kind people.

**What Went Wrong**: Antigua is beautiful and safe, but it is a tourist-oriented city, so many restaurants and vendors cater to tourists. I chose to stay in Antigua for safety reasons, but I wish I had had the opportunity to stay in a different part of the country as well (with caution).

**Recommendations:** Try pupusas from various places, as they can be quite hit or miss. If you want to try a decent traditional breakfast in San Salvador, look for a food court on Sunday morning where there’s a crowd of people lined up. The nightlife in San Salvador is more local and lively than in Antigua. Lastly, don't underestimate the Acatenango hike, and the additional hike to Fuego is not really worth the money and time unless you're seeking an adventure.

**Final Verdict:** I am definitely coming back to explore more of Central America in the near future. 10 days was definitely not enough to experience everything, but it gave me a good taste of the country, its culture, and nature!",2024-10-02 23:47:40

* Fly Bangkok - Tokyo (6 hours) , spend my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

**Idea 2:**

* Fly London - Tokyo (original ticket), transfer to Seoul (2 hours) to spend 1,5 week in South Korea
* Fly Seoul - Tokyo (2 hours), spend extra 0,5 week + the rest of my original already planned for 2 weeks in Japan.

  
My question is: Although I want to make huge of these holidays as its quite rare as an adult to get this much free time, Is this too much for a first solo trip? Also is Idea 1 too packed with Thailand in there and the 6 hour haul? Or would you just YOLO this and make huge of this opportunity?  In other words, what would you recommend ? I feel like my brain is in overdrive and I want too much too fast and I am not thinking straight :P

Also happily take alternative itineraries! Other countries I find interesting are Vietnam,  China and Indonesia. 

Many thanks! ",2024-10-03 14:22:25

Have any solo travelers done this? I'm wondering about the safety of being out in the desert alone, what if one gets stranded? Also, would love to hear from female solo travelers.

Re Uyuni, is it much cheaper to get a tour from Bolivia or are the ones from Atacama about the same price?

Also, staying in Santiago a couple nights (mainly to rest after a long trip) v. flying direct to Calama on day 1 : what would you choose?

solotravel,1fve7iz,How to deal with long trips,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fve7iz/how_to_deal_with_long_trips/,20,"Hi. I have traveled several times across Europe without many problems. Now I would like to travel further away. I thought about visiting other parts of the world, especially Southeast Asia. I am not afraid of flights or planes, but I am afraid of airports, the travel bureaucracy and how “uncomfortable” it is going to be.



I will explain my last trip, which was fairly straightforward. My flight was at 10 am. I had no way to get to the airport that early as I live far away and the public transport is limited. So I left home the day before at 18:00, and took a bus that dropped me off in the airport city at 21:00. There, I took the subway and went to a friend's house where I was able to rest and sleep. The next morning, I woke up at 6:00, showered and left. I took another subway to the city centre, and a bus that went straight to the airport. I reached the airport at 8:00. The plane took off at 10:00 and landed at 13:00 without delay, an easy three-hour flight. I did not feel comfortable sitting there for three hours because I have long legs and am constantly getting up when sitting in the office, but it was bearable. I grabbed my luggage and left the airport an hour later. Then I took the subway to the city center. From the city center, I took a bus to my destination town, when I finally arrived at the hotel it was already 6:00 pm. So everything was perfect, without a single problem, and yet the whole process took me 24 hours. A 3-hour flight means an actual journey time of 24 hours. I wasted a whole day pretty much sitting down and seeing nothing. It was good, because I was able to sleep and shower. And the next days in my destination were certainly enjoyable.



I am afraid that I will not be able to do something like this if my trip is much longer and with layovers.. I don't know how to sleep without a proper bed. And I don't have the money to book a private jet or fly on a luxurious first class plane with beds and showers. I am aware that a trip to another continent will be expensive, but I try not to make it super expensive. I am afraid of feeling uncomfortable on the plane after many hours. I am especially afraid that as soon as I get off the plane I will feel exhausted in the airport and pass out or fall asleep in the airport. I'm also afraid of having any problem with the stopover.



So I thought what if I just fly to Istanbul or anywhere in the Middle East for a couple of days, and then fly again after a good night's sleep. But I can't find anything like that. Whether I use sites like Skyscanner or airline sites, they only show me layovers shorter than 24 hours. Shorter layovers scare me because I fear missing the second flight. Longer layovers scare me because I don't know what to do in an airport for a bunch of hours feeling dirty, sleepy and scared. And I'm afraid to leave the airport if the layover is less than 24 hours.



I don't take any medicine to sleep, and the doctor recommended me to not take any. So I'd like to know how you would organize a flight like that. And what are your tips to deal with long flights and stopovers. I couldn't find any post with this kind of fears.",2024-10-03 18:11:53
solotravel,1fuvo7z,Help finalizing my Europe trip in late October/early November,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fuvo7z/help_finalizing_my_europe_trip_in_late/,15,"TLDR: Europe Oct 20-Nov 7, first time in Europe, any help answering any or all of the questions listed below, thanks

Hey y’all, I am going to be in Europe from Oct 20 to Nov 7 (if needed, can flex it to Nov 8). This is my first time solo traveling and first time in Europe. I’m 23 and do not have a budget, so cost does not need considered.

The only big thing I have booked is my flight from USA to Lisbon, which lands me there on the morning of Oct 20. While I love the concept of winging it, I also want the return flight booked for my own peace of mind. I think I’m going to spend 2-3 days in Porto, the do Galway and Rome.

I have my hostel booked in Lisbon from Oct 20 to Oct 27. While I know that may be longer than most would want to stay there, I figured I’d dip my toes in for my first solo travel and first time in Europe. It also gives me a bit of time to unwind from work since it has been very busy. However, I’m willing to shorten that leg of the trip by a day or two based on the answers to some of these questions.

I’m trying to finalize some of my details, but am struggling to make a decision. Any responses to any of the questions below would be a huge help. Thanks in advance!

1. Will the nightlife in Lisbon be decent on the weekdays given the time of year, or if I want at least one “fun” (in the drinking sense) night out I should stay on the weekend?

2. One thing I really want to do in Lisbon is the flea market. Part of why I booked so long is so I could do it on Saturday. Is the Tuesday one just as good as Saturday? If so, and depending on the answer to Question 1, I would cut my Lisbon trip by a day or two to give some more time for the other places.

3. Can I do Porto in 2 days, or should I do 3 days? I am not trying to cram tourist stuff in, more just trying to chill and experience the culture. The only tourist thing I think I want to do is a wine tour in the Douro Valley. 

4. I know for sure I want to do Galway and Rome, but I’m struggling to decide which first. Is the weather going to be that much different in Ireland during the last week of October vs first week of November?

5. How long is too long for Galway? I know my Lisbon leg is longer than recommended, and I know Rome has a ton to offer, so I’m trying to figure out what time I should spend in Galway. Other than the Cliffs of Moher and maybe a couple of other things, I’m mainly looking to chill and hit some pubs.

6. I was planning on flying into Dublin and taking a train or bus to Galway. As far as sightseeing/stops along the way goes, is Shannon Airport a better option? Regardless of where I land, what are some things to see along the way from either Dublin or Shannon to Galway?

7. Has anyone stayed at the Beehive in Rome? I am likely choosing this as my hostel, but wanted to know if it is in a good location (I’ve read hostelworld, just want to hear from y’all)

Sorry for the wall of text, like I said I appreciate any help I can get. Thanks!",2024-10-03 00:47:46

I didn't travel when I was younger, partly due to lack of confidence and to some extent money.

I went to Singapore earlier in the year (for 1 week), amazing if expensive and I guess the least exotic of country of that region, although some of it seemed characterful to me (didn't get the criticisms of it).

For my upcoming (hopefully) trip, I was thinking of Chiang Mai, Luang Prabang and as yet unchosen place in Vietnam. It's mostly exploring outdoors and nature that I'm up for, to a lesser extent cultural things, not really interested in beaches, markets or other busy places (maybe briefly). Is a month in each about right or will I get bored?

For a longer trip I think it's more the coordination/admin of it that scares me. I've only used Expedia before (for New York, Berlin, Amsterdam, Singapore) but I think that's out of the question here. Single flights seem almost as expensive as returns, so I think I need an ""open-jaw"" return? Do I just buy a ticket and then  hope I find appropriate accommodation, seems crazy? I'm also a bit worried about making the timings match up if I need to include the time to get to the next place, so might just stay in 3 hotels/AirBNBs to minimise that, unless someone can convince me this is easy to organise on the fly?

Hoping to keep spending under £10K (Edit: Yes, I picked a too big number. Enthusiasm for the idea made me want to overspend. I think I'll aim for under £5K, avoiding shared rooms still possible I think). If it's a lot less than this, even better (may do another trip) but I don't want to do Hostels or anything that cheap. AirBNB has places in Chiang Mai for £400 a month that look quite nice, so this looks easily doable, if the other locations are cheaper still.

solotravel,1ftpijd,My ordeal to the worst immigration experience in Georgia! ,343,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ftpijd/my_ordeal_to_the_worst_immigration_experience_in/,224,"Sadly, I am on of those randomly picked unlucky people who was not only deported back to Baku but also was harassed mentally and mocked in Georgia at the immigration. 

I am 33F, a solo traveler and Georgia was supposed to be my 13th country! My plan was for 11 days with 5 days in Azerbaijan and 6 days in Georgia. I was looking forward to Georgia since months and had so many plans, just to meet my biggest nightmare! 

- 26th SEP afternoon 2.45 PM,  I landed from India to Baku and the immigration was so smooth with pleasantries exchanged and a warm welcome. Only my hard copy of E-Visa was checked, but when I shared the return ticket from Tbilisi, they asked for Georgia E-Visa, and approved it after looking at it. 

- had amazing 5 days in Azerbaijan and on 1st October midnight 12:20 AM was my flight to Tbilisi. They asked me for the E-Visa at immigration while leaving Azerbaijan, then at check in and then while boarding. Everywhere they claimed it’s perfect and I am good to go. 

- 1st October 1.40 AM I land in Tbilisi all happy and pumped up just to realise my biggest trauma of travelling is going to hit. I had my E-Visa, travel insurance, cards and bank statements I used for the visa application ( all the mandatory documents needed and mentioned on the website) 

- immigration officer calls me and the first thing he does is scream at me to show the E-Visa coz I took 2-3 seconds to show him. Then he goes on to ask “are you alone?” and I said yes, and he goes on to say “how can you be alone? Are you sure you are alone?” I said I am travelling solo. He makes faces and says what is solo travelling, to which the female immigration officer next to him explains but he shuns her down. Next he tells me to show him cash to survive, I said I use cards to withdraw money and I can do that now only, but I am carrying my bank statements to show the proofs of funds, even the female immigration officer said this suffice the need and even asked him to give me the stamping coz she showed how I have so many stamps on my visa including Turkey and Oman. But once again he shuns her down and then rudely tells me to go meet someone else in the corner interrogation room !

- now starts the harassment! This officer didn’t even greet me but goes on to say “sit down” “what are you doing alone here” “why are you staying in the hostel if you say you have cards and money, why not a fancy hotel” I said I am a solo traveler so I try and be safe in hostels. Then he was like how do I trust these bank statements what if they are from someone else, I said these are authorised and have my details and I used the same for the application. Then he throws them at me and says these are in your currency, show me Lari, I tried converting the bank balance to lari and he started laughing at me that you have so much money and you are staying in a hostel, he implied I was lying. I said I can book a five start hotel if he wants proof and can take out as much cash as he wants. Then he asked me to open my bank account online, now I was connecting to the wifi and won’t lie was so scared that I took more than 2-3 min coz he was asking me questions too. And he goes on to scream, I have decided you are rejected, you didn’t show me funds. And he asked me to get out of the room. Then he was like you now go back to Baku but can come back within 10 days and appeal and you would surely be allowed and with that smirk of win. I was made to sit without any answers for hours before the deported me back to Baku. Then the Baku immigration officers asked me to book a flight asap to India and mind it I booked one way flight for 40k and I am currently in Doha while I write this. 

- they didn’t give me my passport until I was boarding. My luggage is still in Tbilisi and I have to raise a claim to try and get it back. 

- when I asked one officer in Baku with tears in my eyes, he said “I saw your passport and you have good travel history and you had E-Visa, so I don’t know why they did this. We would love to host you again in Azerbaijan and don’t take it to your heart and forget it as a bad day” 

- I am dying to reach back to India coz every inch of my body is scared and traumatised! I have studied abroad and even worked there even when I was just 21 and still never felt this horror! 

I did read a lot about such stories but then since a few months everyone said positive things. Now I know I might be that 1% or even less of the lot that got unlucky but I think I would take ample time to move on. My money, my energy and my faith in solo travel is shaken. ",2024-10-01 14:31:00

India: 
New Delhi 2N, Agra 2N, Jaipur 2N. 

Will catch morning trains between the cities in 2AC.  

Flight Jaipur to Hong Kong. Spend 1 night in HK then train into China. Couldn't find any good direct flights from India into kunming or zhangjiajie. 

China:
I get 15 days visa free in china. Zhangjiajie, Yangshuo, yunnan for 14 days then train back into HK.

Hong Kong: 5 to 7 days in HK.

Flight HK to Beijing.

China: spending a week in HK should reset my 15 days in china. Will do Beijing, Xi'an, Lhasa and Chengdu. Fly to Guangzhou then back home on day 15.",2024-10-02 07:50:33

About me:

* Traveling alone, single mid 40s male.
* Generally I love big cities but I also lean much more towards relaxing more than adventure. Beaches are ok. Hiking does nothing for me.
* Which also means I generally don’t like more than 2 cities. 3 at most. 1 is even fine if there are a bunch of day trips.
* Love street food and foodie stuff (non gourmet) in general. (don't like seafood)
* Love things like replica markets. Or general tech type areas (think Akihabara or something).
* Love wildlife so seeing monkeys/sea turtles etc is cool.
* A ferry to or from somewhere sounds fun, even overnight (not the bunkbeds in a common room kind though).
* Safety is huge for me. I don't want to feel like I have to be on guard while I'm on vacation. But I think most of PH is safe? I don't plan on going into slums in Manila like a dumb travel vlogger or something.
* Would enjoy meeting locals more than other tourists. A big reason I chose it is the friendliness of the locals I always hear about.

My original idea is one week Cebu City doing some day trips, and one week in Manila doing the same. But I'm not married to the idea. Honestly the city I want to see most is Baguio for the weather (I hate extreme heat so Baguio seems like my PH dream city) but it's prob too much trouble to get to this time?

Already looking up best areas for the first 3-4 nights in Cebu. I mostly hear Ayala Business area?

solotravel,1fsue3e,The Baltics solo traveling experience,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fsue3e/the_baltics_solo_traveling_experience/,35,"For the first time in my life I have planned a trip from Vilnius to Riga to Tallinn and back.

I absolutely love all three of these countries, especially Vilnius, since I am an international student there.

Weirdly enough, I never felt like I needed people the whole trip. No bad feelings, except when I was eating alone in restaurants. Otherwise, it was a very beautiful experience. Riga reminds me of my home country of Romania, and Tallinn impressed me with their array of medieval themed bars and restaurants.
However, Riga felt more authentic and less touristy compared to Tallinn.

Traditional food and youth atmosphere in Vilnius is amazing. From 8 to 10 euros you can enjoy a very filling meal with traditional potato dumplings. 
I traveled cheaply with Flixbus and Luxespress (I recommend this provider for their good youth discounts). The museums weren't so expensive and neither the lodging. I spent around 250 euros for 4 and half days in Riga and Tallinn. I don't sleep in hostels due to very light sleeping.

For the more adventurous, a ferry can be taken from Tallinn to Helsinki, but seeing as I'm a student from a developing country I really couldn't afford Helsinki due to very high prices. (Even 50-60 euros minimum in hostels)

But you need time, patience and determination.

Even if the weather was generally rainy or stormy, it didn't make my experience any less beautiful.

Tips and tricks for good food:
- Ludo restaurant chains in Riga have very good and filling food for a decent price. You eat like a king for 10 euros and the food is healthy.
- III Drakoon tavern in Tallinn for authentic medieval experience. The meat pastries with cinnamon are really good for 3.5 Euro a piece.
- Kompressor pub in Tallinn has very good and big portions of salty and sweet pancakes for a maximum of 8-9 euros a portion.
- The ciders in the baltic countries are very good, one can find specialty ciders for decent prices.
- Vilnius is cheapest and closest to the eastern European feeling of home for me, many dining options and good student canteens available, generally until 3 pm on work days.

I loved the baltic states as they reminded me of home. Only thing I can't accustom to is the lack of hills above 400m, but the beautiful fir tree and birch forests and the unique nature definitely make up for it.

About transports:
- Public transport in Riga and Tallinn is a bit complicated, as the apps for buying tickets are not easily accessible, but in Riga you can buy bus tickets from many supermarkets. In Tallinn public transport is more expensive, with 2 euros per 90 minutes trip. Sometimes bolt scooters are more practical for short distances. 
- Public transport in Vilnius is a bit easier to deal with, although the traffic jams in week days are a bit messy.",2024-09-30 12:32:48

I also love trying local food and the random splurge on local goods and souvenirs, so if there’s anything you think is worth taking back home as a memory I’d appreciate that. I especially love clothes and little knick knacks.

For context, I travelled to Bogota previously and was already familiar with being in Latin America and I have spent a lot of time in various cities.

I used a driver to/from the airport that was recommended to me. He has his own transportation/tourism business. He was such a gem and spoke fluent english. I couldn't recommend him enough, and I'm happy to share his information, just send me a DM.

The area I was in was a bustling metropolis, think NYC or Chicago. I spent the majority of my time walking around the city and found it to be very safe.

My Spanish is on a beginner level and I was able to get by with that. Whenever I needed to I just pulled out my phone and used a translation app. I found most people to be friendly and willing to help when needed.

I highly recommend going to Chapultepec Park, the closest comparison is Central Park, but I found it to be much safer than Central Park. In my opinion, this is the gem of the city.

I'll leave it there, I'm happy to answer any questions!

edit: i used airolo as an eSim card. it worked perfectly for my iOS and I highly recommend it.

I’m planning my **first solo trip** to Peru and would really appreciate some advice! I’m a **Dutch guy** 25M, I speak **decent Spanish (B1 level)**, and I have a budget of around **€1200** (not including flights). I’ve put together a **3 to 4 week itinerary**, but I’m worried it might be too packed. I’m also considering **skipping Puno/Lake Titicaca** to make room for a visit to the **Amazon**, since I love nature and wildlife. Here's what I have so far:

# Trip Overview:

* **Length**: 3 to 4 weeks
* **Travel Style**: Budget-friendly (staying in hostels, eating mostly budget meals, using **Peru Hop** buses except for one inland flight from Cuzco to Lima).
* **Budget**: Around **€1200** for the trip (excluding international flights, which I’ve already budgeted for).
* **Main Focus**: Experience the major sights of Peru, while also enjoying nature and outdoor activities.

# Itinerary:

1. **Lima** (4 nights): Explore the historical center, Barranco, and Miraflores. Any good nearby nature spots I shouldn’t miss?
2. **Paracas** (2 nights): Visit the **Paracas National Reserve** (skipping the boat tour to the Ballestas Islands I think).
3. **Huacachina** (2 nights): **Sandboarding** and dune buggying in the desert oasis.
4. **Nazca** (2 nights): I plan to skip the Nazca Lines flight but might visit the aqueducts and other local sights. Not sure if I should cut this stop altogether.
5. **Arequipa** (4 nights): Explore the city, visit **Santa Catalina Monastery**, and maybe do a day trip to **Colca Canyon**.
6. **Cuzco and Sacred Valley** (6 nights): Acclimatize in Cuzco, explore the **Sacred Valley** (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras), and visit **Machu Picchu** (1 night in Aguas Calientes).

# My Dilemma:

I think a trip to the **Amazon** may be eye-opening for me, wildly different for me than visiting ancient cultural sites (something I'm more familiar with), but I’m not sure if I should cut something from my itinerary. I’m also considering **Puno/Lake Titicaca** and could in principle add a few days and money as needed to include one of these, in case my current itinerary indeed is not too packed or expensive.

The two Amazon options I’m considering are:

1. **Puerto Maldonado** (from Cuzco), to visit the **Tambopata National Reserve**.
2. **Iquitos** (northern Amazon), but that seems harder to reach without a flight.

# Questions:

1. **Is my itinerary still too packed** for a 3 to 4 week trip? Should I cut anything else for more downtime or flexibility? I plan to take buses so maybe I should account for a lot more recovery time as some rides are very long.
2. **Is my budget of €1200 realistic? If not, I will cut Nazca and surely not add other stops.** 
3. **Puno and Lake Titicaca**: Is it worth visiting, or does it make sense to skip it in favor of the Amazon since I’m a nature lover? Do they differ a lot money/time-wise? 
4. **Amazon**: If I add the Amazon, would you recommend **Tambopata** (Puerto Maldonado) or **Iquitos** for the best experience? Any advice on how to fit this into the itinerary?
5. **Nazca**: Should I skip Nazca altogether if I’m not doing the flight over the Lines?

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this trip more manageable. My budget is around **€1200** for the 3 to 4 weeks (excluding flights), so I’m trying to strike the right balance between **adventure, nature, and culture** and enjoying an occasional night of nightlife, without feeling rushed.

Thanks so much for your help!",2024-09-30 08:41:48
solotravel,1fs7co3,"My Solo Travel Advice for the Undecided
",196,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fs7co3/my_solo_travel_advice_for_the_undecided/,36,"Our decision to go on a solo travel adventure without the company of family or friends can be daunting but courageous. The benefits of Solo Travel often outweigh the drawbacks of going it alone. 

My decision to travel solo was made after the break up of a 26-year relationship with my former partner.

It made me question my very existence, and emotionally, I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life.

I felt a strong need to get away from everything, including family and friends, and changing the environment was the only way I would survive this period in my life.

I resigned from my job in the City of London and joined a voluntary program in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, teaching English to teenagers preparing for university entrance exams abroad.

I can honestly say my time in Rio de Janeiro was a pivotal moment in my life. Seeing the poverty in the Rio favelas and how the communities pulled together to drive out the criminal gangs who had ruled their lives for years opened my eyes. It made my emotional trauma pale into insignificance.

I spent eight months in Rio de Janeiro teaching English and overstaying my visa, which I don’t recommend. I then solo travelled through Central America and the USA, visiting the east and west coasts, before returning home to the UK after almost a year away.

During my self-imposed exile from the UK, I met many people who have become lifelong friends.

I returned home with a newfound appreciation for what I had. Being able to wake up every day and enjoy the company of neighbours, family, and friends is a blessing we all take for granted.

My feelings towards my former partner changed. I was more empathetic and tried to understand why our relationship broke down.

After many discussions, we both came to the realisation that we just wanted different things in life. Neither one of us was at fault for our relationship's breakup. And even though we are no longer together, we have remained close friends.

If I had not gone on a solo travel adventure, I would never have changed my feelings towards life and my own existence. Finding some purpose and making a contribution was essential to me.

Whatever your reasons for deciding to head out on a solo travel adventure, and this will be different for everyone, believe me when I say it will change your life for the better.

Fear and anxiety keep us from talking to each other face-to-face. This breeds mistrust, leading us to harbour prejudices against other people and cultures.

Getting out of your comfort zone, ceasing the endless scrolling on social media (reading and listening to other people’s baseless information), and discovering what this world has to offer will truly open your eyes and reinvigorate your belief in the spirit of human nature.

If you’ve been contemplating a solo travel adventure, I want to reassure you that you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

With proper planning and a source of financial support, your dream of a solo travel adventure can be realised.

I would love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience to mine and why you decided to go on a solo travel adventure.

I wish everyone who takes the plunge to solo travel all the best!

It happened to me on my last trip to Japan where I'm supposed to be able to view Mt Fuji but due to weather I had to postpone my activities and end up feeling rushed as I had activities planned the next day and I have to include the activities from the previous day. 

Some guys like to stay in a hostel or guesthouse to get to know other ppl but it's not for me. I find it uncomfortable staying with strangers in the same room and rather stay in a room by myself and is willing to pay abit more to get a room for myself in a hotel or Airbnb but I'm open to meetup with some online guys for a meal which I did during my recent solo trips. But does anyone ever feel sad or lonely especially when it's the last few days of the trip? 

I only have one criteria for my travel destinations.The destination needs to have good public transportation as I don't drive. I learned the lesson of travelling solo in LA where public transport is not great and I had to spend a alot on uber to reach my destinations. It also wasn't safe taking the public transport in LA. I had someone show me his dagger in the LA metro. I had to quickly walk away to security as I felt my life was in danger..

I have 2 trips that I might be keen to travel to soon. 
1) 2 week holiday to Europe. Specifically in Manchester and London before proceeding to Paris and ending my trip in Switzerland. 
2) A week trip to Sydney or should I include Melbourne on the same trip?

I do have some concerns regarding Europe as I saw many news of pickpockets and I'm afraid of being a  target. ",2024-09-29 21:54:00

How do you manage to leave for months at a time several times a year? Where’s the money to travel and maintain a home while you’re gone coming from? Do you work odd jobs in the countries you go to?

Am I assuming too much? I could see someone younger than 25. Being unteathered is normal when you’re that young. So is still living with mom and dad. But I’m seeing this from people damn near 40. 

I love solo traveling, but the most I can afford is two weeks maybe twice a year. 

EDIT: I’d like to thank everyone for the great responses. They confirmed what I was thinking, but they also made me think about a few things. What I do for a living doesn’t allow for me to take substantial time off (I’m a voice actor) and still eat. I also have to maintain a home for my studio. However, I’ve read some great ways to take more time than I do with minimal disruption to my life. Thank you again. ",2024-09-28 16:01:49
solotravel,1fsgdf6,Critique My 2-Month South America Itinerary,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fsgdf6/critique_my_2month_south_america_itinerary/,18,"I’m gearing up for my first solo travel experience, and I couldn’t be more excited! After plenty of family and friend trips around Europe and North America, I’m ready for solo traveling through SA.

Here’s the breakdown of my plan:

**Background**

I’m a 20-year-old female traveler, and this is my first time solo traveling, though I’ve done a fair bit of exploring with friends and family. I don’t speak Spanish, but I’m picking up some basics and hope to learn more on the go. I’m planning to travel from early November to the end of December, aiming for a relaxed pace. I want to soak up the culture, meet new friends, and stay flexible enough to extend my stay if I find a spot I love.

My budget is $3,500 for the trip.

**Itinerary**

Buenos Aires, Argentina (\~1 week)

Salta & Jujuy (\~1 week)

Salar de Uyuni (\~3 days)

Potosí (\~2 days)

Sucre (\~3 days)

La Paz (\~5 days)

Copacabana (\~2 days)

Cusco (\~2 week)

Arequipa & Huacachina (\~1 week)

Lima (\~3 days)

I’ll be flying to Quito from Lima.

**Feedback Wanted**

Does this itinerary feel too rushed, or does it strike the right balance? I’d love tips on places to meet fellow travelers and any recommendations for beginner surf spots along the way. 

I plan to travel primarily by overnight and long-distance buses, except for the Buenos Aires to Salta route, where I found that flying is only slightly more expensive than taking the bus. I’ll also fly from Lima to Quito. Does this sound like a realistic plan?

Do you have any specific safety tips for a young female traveler like myself on her first solo trip?

Thanks in advance for your help, I'm eager to hear your thoughts :)",2024-09-29 22:19:41
solotravel,1fro4i4,Overthinking during trip is stopping me from fully enjoying my time. ,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fro4i4/overthinking_during_trip_is_stopping_me_from/,41,"I’m on my first ever solo trip to Europe, in London currently, and everyday there seems to be some type of thing that goes wrong, that I wish I did differently, something I shouldn’t have done etc. that I can’t stop ruminating on. 

I’m trying my hardest to not overthink and thankfully within a day or so I feel fine, but then again something else happens that frustrates me. 

Its been things like dealing a scammy money exchange that overcharged by 25 dollars, dealing with unresponsive hosts/experiences, regretting restaurant choices, to just today I woke up super late and ended up being an hour late to the Harry Potter studio tour. The tour was incredible, but the for a lot of it I felt slighty rushed even though I didn’t need to be. I even ended up having ~45 minutes left before closing so really was fine, but that rumination of kicking myself for being late/wasting time/feeling rushed kept crawling up in my head. 

I think it’s a combination of nerves doing all of this on my own for the first time, not wanting to waste my time here and make the most of it, and this looming pressure of having to have fun or the best time ever? Also i know ruminating on negative feelings is common, but I really do want to just enjoy my trip, and I’m sad that it’s colored the tour I was just on. I still did love it, but it’s not a great feeling. 

Anyone else relate? I’m glad I came on this trip since it’s really forcing me to confront this feeling head on in a way, so would love to hear your experiences with overthinking on trips! 

Edit: I’ll respond to specific comments in the tomorrow but thank you so much for your comments! I was so much in my head and really just needed a vent but your insights are so appreciated. 

It’s funny bc right after I posted my phone actually died (turns out if my power banks battery is lower than my phone my phone will charge the power bank instead of the other way around 💀💀) and was scrambling with yet another thing gone wrong 

But then I found a pub close to the train that had great vibes, the cheapest drinks I’ve found in London yet, and a charger at every table. Grabbed two super tasty cocktails, changed my phone, ate a late night burger and now im back ready to pass out! I probably would’ve never hit that pub otherwise and I’m so glad I did, things really do work out when traveling in the weirdest ways :) ",2024-09-28 21:02:59

I’m on my first solo international backpacking trip and I’m feeling so burnt out. I’ve woken up every day for the last week with my first thought being “i just want to go home” which really puts a damper on my days. 
For context I’ve been on the road for about 45 days in southern Europe. I really want to go to SE Asia but i’ve found it’s actually the exact same amount of time & money to get there from where I am currently as it would be to go from home (back in San Francisco.) So i’m heavily debating pausing my trip, going home for a few months, working something seasonal for the holidays and re-starting at the end of December with new wind in my sails. 

But I also feel this would be so silly as I might regret leaving sooner than I anticipated on top of spending the money on 3 flights rather than 2. Will I feel disappointed in myself for calling it quits? That’s the biggest question I keep debating with myself back & forth over and over again, I’ve been ruminating for days. 
I also got sick last week and my period started a few days after so I’ve been dealing with those annoying inconveniences as well & i’m not sure how much that’s tainting my view. 

More of a rant I guess to get it off my chest but if you were me, what would you do? Would pausing your trip even be an option to you? Would you judge your friend if they did that after talking & talking about this 6-9 month trip for years? Maybe I’m just judging myself…I don’t know what to do but I’m homesick and exhausted.",2024-09-29 15:11:54

Toyko (4 days)

Team labs,
DisneySea,
Ghibli Museum, 
Shopping in Shibuya,
Walking tour: Shinjuku & Harajuku

Kyoto (3 days)

Arashiyama,
Fushimi Shrine,

Osaka (2 days)

Dotonbori,
Sumiyoshi Shrine,
Hozen-Ji Temple,
Namba Shrine,
Minoh Falls

Is this too much for 9 days? How many days would you spend in each place?

I'm also looking for accommodation recommendations. I'm budgeting about $50/night. Hotels are preferred,  but I wouldn't mind a hostel for a couple of nights to meet some other travelers. APA hotels seem to fit the bill.

Any recommendations for food? ",2024-09-28 11:06:42

I (45m) am about to visit Albania for the first time as a solo-traveller (I will rent a car) and would like to ask you for feedback about the following itinerary:

Particularly, I have the following doubts:

- Is 1 full day too much for Gjirokaster?
- Will the beaches still be fine (swimmable)?
- How to improve day 4/day 5? That part of the plan doesn't really convince me yet. :-(
- Did I leave any special place out? Maybe Kruje?

solotravel,1fr4mnw,r/solotravel Town Hall 2024,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fr4mnw/rsolotravel_town_hall_2024/,33,"Hi [](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/) community!

Wow, we've grown to over 3.9 million members. It's really quite something!

Since it's been a while since we've held an open forum, we (the volunteer mod team) decided it's time to get some feedback from our community. Yes, this means you.

**Things we've implemented:**

* **Expanded Wiki content**: We've been building out our [ Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/index) steadily, to help those new to solo travel planning as well as those more experienced. Content added or updated recently includes articles on [Budgeting 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/budgeting), [Money Management and Safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/money), [Packing 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/packing), figuring out your [travel interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/interests), [staying in hostels](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/hostels), [meeting people and making friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/meetingpeople), [staying safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/stayingsafe) (including safety for women, POC travellers/visible minorities, and LGBTQ+ travellers), regional trip planning guides for [Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/eurotrip) and [Southeast Asia](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/seasiatrip), resources for those struggling with [mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/mentalhealth), and guides to [Travel Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/travelinsurance) and [SIM cards / mobile data](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/simcards).
* **Weekly destination threads**: We've created sticky threads for popular cities and travel destinations, where people can add their experiences, popular things to see and do, accommodation and food recommendations, tips and tricks, and questions. You can consult the archives of these threads here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/weeklydestinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/weeklydestinations).
* **Trip report of the month**: Recently, we've been experimenting with highlighting a trip report submitted by a user each month, as a way to promote these reports and encourage more people to submit them.
* **Combatting spam**: The spammers keep getting more sophisticated, and so too must we. In the past few months, we've introduced new Reddit tools to identify bot-generated and spam posts and accounts. These tools aren't perfect, but we hope you've noticed a difference.
* **Creating a more inclusive space**: Our ongoing efforts to filter and remove content and comments that violate our subreddit policy against hate speech, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry, harassment, and gatekeeping. We're a small team of volunteers and we can't catch everything, but we've added some automoderator tools to help us filter content that violates these rules. We also encourage members to use the ""report"" button if you see any comments that violate the spirit of this policy, so we can review and remove them as required - due to the large size of the subreddits, the mods might not see those comments if they're not reported.
* **New rules against AI-generated content:** In response to the widespread use of AI tools like ChatGPT being used by many, we've decided to implement rules against posting copy/paste itineraries from AI tools for community review, as most of this content is, by definition, low effort. We can always revisit this rule in the case where AI tools become much better at travel planning. But for now, we feel that it enhances the quality of the community if people make some effort reviewing and vetting their proposed itineraries before sharing them with the community.

**Ongoing Issues**

* **New posts awaiting moderation**: Due to the large size of the subreddit, all new threads need to be manually approved by the mods. This can take a few hours. Unfortunately Reddit's removal message for new posts that are awaiting review and approval isn't very intuitive. As a result, many people think their posts have been deleted, when they're simply in the queue awaiting review. This leads to a lot of people submitting the same post multiple times, or sending modmail to the mod team asking about the status of their posts. We're working on some technical solutions to this, but in the meantime, we ask your patience.
* **Limited sticky posts**: At the moment, many versions of Reddit are only displaying the top two sticky posts at the top of the subreddit. We use one for the Weekly General Chatter & Accommodation thread, and a second for our Weekly Destination Thread (currently the holiday megathread for 2024). Ideally, we'd like to have more stickied threads, so we can split out separate threads for new travellers/anxiety, for accommodating requests, and for destination advice.
* **Other issues on mobile:** There are some technical issues when accessing Reddit via the mobile app that make it difficult for some users to add flair to their posts or to submit. We're aware of this, and as it's a sitewide issue, there's a limited amount we can do about it. If you're having trouble from the mobile app, try using Reddit on your desktop.

**Things We'd Like Feedback On**

**1) Our community rules**

The [complete rules of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/completerules) can be found on our Wiki, and we have shortened versions on the sidebar. We know that some rules aren't always popular with everyone in the community, but we aim to enforce them fairly and with an eye towards creating an engaging space. Agree/disagree with the rules? Want to see changes? Let us know.

**2) Low effort posts**

Probably the most commonly violated community rule -- and most common reason we remove posts -- is for being low effort. We get dozens upon dozens of posts each day along the lines of ""plan my trip"" or ""where should I go?"" or ""vote on X vs Y place"" or ""what is there to do in X place?"", or posts asking a question that could easily be answered via a search. Given the size of our community, these posts would quickly flood the subreddit with uninteresting conversations if allowed, so we're inclined to keep this rule in place. However, we're open to feedback on how we implement it.

**3) Relationship posts**

We've had a large influx lately of posts asking for advice about personal or family relationships with regards to solo travel. The most common themes include: Solo travel after a breakup, heartbreak after meeting someone on the road, people asking for help in convincing their parents/friends/spouse to let them travel solo, or similar. How do you feel about these posts? Are there too many, too few, not enough? What would you like to see us do about them (e.g., nothing, ""curate"" the best ones, kill it with fire, something else)?

**4) Tough times / depression / loneliness posts**

Solo travel isn't always sunshine and roses, and social media can sometimes create false expectations. We've had a recent surge in the number of posts from people who are on the road and are struggling with tough times and looking for advice. Generally, we try to allow such posts, because we know that community support can sometimes be helpful. However, we're conscious of the fact that there have been a lot of these posts, and we are open to community suggestions on how best to deal with them moving forward. Which types of these posts do you most enjoy? Are there rules you'd like to see us put in place?

**5) Expanded Wiki content**

What else would you like to see on our Wiki? More destination guides? (We're working on one for South America as that's a popular request.). More trip planning articles? More resources for travellers from different demographics or backgrounds? Send us your suggestions! Also, if anyone would like to use their travel experience to help us write Wiki content - including on South America as the mods don't have a lot of experience with that continent - let us know!

**6) Weekly Destination Threads, Trip Reports of the Month, etc.**

Do you enjoy these? Would you like to see more of them, less of them, in a different format, etc.? Are there any particular destinations or trip reports you'd like to see featured in the upcoming months? If you enjoy this type of content, are there other ways you'd like to see us incentivize it?

**7) Anything else** you'd like to see more of, less of, or change? This is your community; speak up now.

**8) Feedback on us, your volunteer mod team.** Yep, that's right, we know we're only human and we make mistakes. This is your chance to let us know what you think of the moderation on this subreddit.

**Call for moderators**

And finally: We're a small team right now, and this is a growing community. Most of us are volunteers with day jobs, and we can't always keep up with the moderation queue as fast as we'd like. If you're a member with a history of positive contribution to the community and would like to put your name forward to be considered as a moderator, please [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/solotravel).",2024-09-28 02:39:13
solotravel,1frkade,Mom is acting super immature about solo trip ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1frkade/mom_is_acting_super_immature_about_solo_trip/,35,"So I’m 20M and I’m planning on applying to go to Mexico City for a solo trip. Well technically it’s a group study held by my university, but I’m going by myself for really the first time. 

The trip is not guaranteed as I still have to submit an application. However when I told my mom about my plans, she reacted super immaturely and is still in a bad mood right now 

She thinks that I’m “dumb” for doing this trip and wasting my money, even though I’m also applying for a grant and if I get it it’ll cover the initial costs of the trip. She also thinks it’s stupid how I’m traveling solo while I’m in university. 

I’m just mad because I see nothing wrong here. This trip is 8 months away and she’s acting like I made the spontaneous decision to go without her consent. I want to see the world and I have the money to do it. This trip is hosted by professors in my major, and it would look amazing on my resume. ",2024-09-28 18:06:17
solotravel,1fr5xra,Advice on continuing trip after uncomfortable experience (first time),13,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fr5xra/advice_on_continuing_trip_after_uncomfortable/,26,"this is v fresh like 7 hours ago fresh and i truly don’t want any judgment or you should have done this or that cause i can/already started doing that myself so i won’t be going into details. but im currently solo traveling in CR and had a really uncomfortable experience where a guide ( much older than me) was basically hitting on me, trying to spend alone time with me, gave me a gift, and touched my waist while getting out of the water. i’ve been solo traveling since 2021 and this isn’t the first time a guy has hit on me but usually it happens on domestic travels where i’m more comfortable to maneuver and when it happens internationally, it has been moreso just compliments from afar with no approach. 

but this is the first time abroad where a man, especially one whose job is meant to make you feel safe (especially as a solo traveler on group tours, guides are the first/quickest friend you came make to break the awkwardness), made me feel really uncomfortable and i couldn’t really escape (it was an island tour so i had to take the boat back with him and the island was only so big/you really couldn’t go anywhere else). 

i feel icky, taken advantage of because im a female solo traveler, and paranoid because i’m in a small beachtown (literally the “town” is total of 100 steps if that) and it’s low season so not many people are here. tomorrow is my last full day but i don’t want to go out/potentially run into him since my hotel is a few steps from the tour office. i didn’t have anything planned either but was going to go get a few gifts for some friends. my energy has been off since i’ve came to this town and was already regretting not going to the Caribbean side like i had first thought of it due to all the rain. it’s sad to say but its the reality for female
solo travelers: honestly surprised this hasn’t happened earlier in my travels ( there was on incident in California but i was more comfortable with telling him about himself lol and it wasn’t as violating as this experience imo)

so my question to my fellow female solo travelers, how can i still enjoy the last day of my trip and not lock myself in my hotel room? any tips?

solotravel,1frtyo7,Feeling Alone with AirBnB,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1frtyo7/feeling_alone_with_airbnb/,44,"I am traveling to Bogota, Colombia for a week and wanted to ask how you deal with being alone in an Airbnb. Assuming that the host is super helpful, answer promptly, and there is nothing wrong with the accommodation but the host does not live in the area. For example, here are some scenarios I think would be helpful if someone was around. I know that these can be ""googled"" but it is just nice to talk to a local about these.

1. Asking for specific restaurants for specific local food.  
2. Maybe asking for help getting taxis super early in the morning.  
3. Preferred supermarkets.

At least, in a hotel, there is a receptionist who may/may not help you if you need anything that is not necessarily room-specific. Or do you contact the host and hopefully the host answers on time (note that I have seen hosts who are super responsive before booking but once you have settled down, they tend to disappear or they become less responsive)?

solotravel,1frcqnd,Domestic US solo birthday trip destinations?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1frcqnd/domestic_us_solo_birthday_trip_destinations/,5,"I'm 31F turning 32 in January living in Texas. Looking to take a solo trip around the first weekend of the new year for about 4-5 days. Any suggestions? 

About me: I'm a social worker, enjoy exploring cute small towns and big cities. I love live music and discovering local cuisine and random conversations with strangers. Very light drinker, though I do love checking out local breweries. Very amateur landscape photographer. I was previously extremely active on the Couchsurfing platform and have a number of good reviews.

What I'm looking for: Open to a big city or a small town or anything in between. I enjoy camping but don't feel comfortable doing it alone. State parks and national parks would be cool for a day hike. I don't have experience driving in very heavy snow so the Midwest/New England are likely out of the question unless it's a relatively big city that's easy to get around without a car; however I love the cold. Open to both driving and flying. 

Ideas so far: Hot Springs, AK (road trip); Portland, OR (fly); Nashville, TN (fly); San Diego, CA (fly).

Would love to hear your suggestions!",2024-09-28 12:02:07

The different cities I’m planning to visit are Málaga, Marbella, Granada, Córdoba and Sevilla in a span of a week. I know it’s short, but I’ll try to get as much as possible. The big dilemma I’m facing right now is the transportation. I absolutely do not want to rent a car. Therefore I’m wondering if you guys have some tips: 

* What are the best ways to travel between cities in Southern Spain without a car? (Bus, train, rideshare?)

* If you’ve ever experienced Southern Spain, what would be your recommendations in terms of order of visit (knowing that I land and take off in Málaga)?

Also kind of not related, if you’ve been to any awesome places for solo travelers in that area, feel free to drop recommendations ! I’m just starting to prepare my itinerary so I’d love to hear about your favorite spots.

* I like to explore hip and cool neighborhoods in the city
* I also like going to cute and unique cafes
* I'm not that big on museums, just some art exhibitions here and there

Here’s what I’ve got so far:

	•	Rome is already booked for 3 nights in the middle of the trip (been there several times already).
	•	I have 4 nights before Rome and then another week after Rome, and I’m thinking of spending them in Tuscany and Umbria.

I’m totally flexible with the days that are not booked yet, and I’d love some recommendations! If I stick with Tuscany and Umbria, I’m particularly interested in nature, hiking, and connecting with other travelers or locals along the way. I’ve seen most of the big cities in Italy and I’m very intrigued by exploring the countryside and less touristy destinations, staying in agriturismo, but I also don’t want to spend too much time by myself and would love to meet other people to hang out with. Renting a car is definitely an option. 

If anyone has recommendations on how to make this trip truly special—whether that’s places to visit, specific hikes, or where to meet other travelers—please share! I’m open to reshuffling my itinerary to make the most of my time.",2024-09-27 19:23:46

I know of two options. One is flixbus. Second one is NS international.

Yet another option is to take the train from Eindhoven to Amsterdam and then I would get more options.

I want to do short/quick trips every other weekend. And want to avoid the long waiting times at the airports.

When I am there I might stay the night at a hotel or return the same day.

The only one I have done so far is Eindhoven to Antwerpen via Ns international. Although there arent many Eindhoven to X city possibilites. I guess I need to first travel to Amsteerdam always?

Flixbus is good too and it guarantees a seat. Although maybe slower than NS international.

Need advice from anyone who has done this before.

What mode of transportation do you use? Do you use anything to save money?",2024-09-27 16:36:35

solotravel,1fq2emj,A sort of scary experience I had during my recent solo trip to Tokyo.,331,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fq2emj/a_sort_of_scary_experience_i_had_during_my_recent/,48,"Just got back home from a solo trip to Tokyo as a 20yo American woman

I was recently in Tokyo, I was mainly around Shibuya and Shinjuku.
Multiple groups of men, foreign, and Japanese did a thing where they sort of surround and started catcalling me, and/or calling me slurs (this is really confusing for a few reasons but I’ll get to that).
For some context. I am a young woman, 20, I wear a lot of dresses (not super skimpy tho). I am of average height, I am American, but I have some Native American facial features that some consider to look Asian (this may or may not be important detail for later on).
I am very pale, I like to wear lipstick, but not much makeup aside from that.
I was traveling mostly solo.
I believe on Sunday night last week, I was in Shibuya heading to get some food with a Japanese friend a bit late at night. I was following behind her, two men came up to me and blocked my way, and they started saying things at me in Japanese.  The friend I was with turned back, grabbed my hand, and pulled me closer to her as we walked away. I asked her “what did they say” she replied “you don’t wanna know”.
On my last night in Tokyo, I was exiting a family mart near my hostel in Shibuya. It was a very populated area, and it was a bit late at night.
A group of European looking men walk up to me and surround me. They seem to be maybe mid to late 20s, but I was a bit disoriented, and I wasn’t gathering the best data. They began saying things to me in a language I did not immediately understand.

I eventually picked up that they were speaking Italian, but I could not think of what to or say. I sort of froze up. I think right as I was about to finally tell them to fuck off, the man who was right in front of my face looking down at me (he was rather tall) began saying random Japanese sounding words and slurs at me. I finally gathered my wits and ran away. I can vaguely remember a bunch of people sitting outside the family mart watching as it happened. 
Before that, multiple Spanish men had called me slurs such as “chinita”in passing, or when I had tried to speaking spanish

(Spanish is my first language due to being Mexican American).
The whole situation is very confusing to talk with people about. I am literally zero percent Asian, so it is extremely bizarre that people were calling me anti Asian slurs, while I’m in Asia! WTF!
The men ganging up on me thing has kind of soured some of my memories unfortunately. I really loved Tokyo and the friends I made, but I think it just now has hit me how scary a situation it was for me, multiple times!",2024-09-26 17:52:08

solotravel,1fqc9km,Trip Report: EuroTrip24 ,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fqc9km/trip_report_eurotrip24/,9,"I had the good fortune to take an extended (for me) EuroTrip- around six weeks. It was a really special experience. While I've traveled and solo traveled fairly extensively, corporate jobs usually cap trip lengths to a couple weeks but this time, I had some time, and I feel like I used it really well, checking off a number of places that have ""always been on my list."". I wanted to share some of the highlights and notes with y'all. When people asked me what I was going to do on my trip I said, ""see some castles, take some boat rides, have some cocktails; you know - Europe things"". I think I did a great job structuring an itinerary to do the tourist-y things on my list and do some ""living"" in each place.  

**Logistics:** 

I flew roundtrip from SFO>LHR on United. Premium Economy on the way there (upgraded with Plus Points) and Polaris on the way back (because I got drunk in Poland and upgraded myself). I took one Lufthansa flight (from Munich to Nice) because I got a bunch of notifications about a rail strike in Italy and that stressed me out. All other travel was via a Eurail pass and/or local public transportation. I'm a lady just above 40 and hostel life isn't for me so I stayed mostly in hotels booked via the HotelsTonight app or Orbitz, with one AirBnB in the middle to do laundry. I packed one checked bag sized suitcase, a backpack, and a small purse. I worked part-time (12-15 hours/week including a couple meetings) the entire time I was gone. I met up with friends for a day in London, two days in Krakow, and 3 days in Nice. Other than that, I was on my own - and even in those cases I managed my own accommodations. I was gone from mid-August to late-September. 

**Locations & Highlights** 

|Location|Highlights|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|London, UK|Operation Mincemeat and Starlight Express were both great. I also really liked the ""From the Personal Collection of Elton John"" photography exhibit at the V&A. |I go to London every 12-18 months to see theater so that's  mostly what I did. Plus a little shopping & pubbing. |
|Amsterdam, The Netherlands|STRAAT Street Art Museum  - probably my favorite museum of the trip!  I took a day trip to Muidenport and thought it was a great small town with a lovely castle. The canal cruise was obligatory and mine was in the pouring rain but it was unlimited wine so we had a great time. |I liked what I did outside the city center a lot more than most of what I did in the city center; it was really crowded. |
|Berlin, Germany |The $20 historical walking tour was interesting. And I saw a really fun show at the Palast Berlin called ""Falling in Love"" that was half Cirque, half dance, and kind of bonkers. |Deutchbahn trains? Not my favorite. |
|Krakow, Poland|The Old Town Square here was one of the most beautiful places I went and the buskers there were top-notch. I did a day trip to Zakopane and the thermal baths which was great. The river cruise was delightful. Wawel Castle was beautiful. |I tried to average at least 12 pierogis a day. I also ended up in a dungeon karaoke bar with a bunch of bros singing 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' in Polish and that was an all-time great experience. |
|Budapest, Hungary|The ""Vampires of Budapest"" night tour was really fun. I did an AirBnB experience to go up a chairlift to the ""highest spot in Budapest"" that was great with really breathtaking views. The obligatory prosecco cruise of the Danube was super picturesque. I had a BIG night out at the Ruins bars. |This was the first city having record highs and a weather advisory. It was 94d F. I am not built for tourism at that temperature which slowed me down a bit. |
|Vienna, Austria |Schloss Schonbrumm was lovely and I really liked the hedge maze! Did a day trip to Holstatt which was even more picturesque than I thought it would be. I really liked the Albertina Museum. Went on a great AirBnB Experience food tour. |It was also too hot here. I was very sweaty. One of my favorite moments was walking through Old Town at 2am listening to 'Vienna' in my headphones and doing a little twirl, having a very main character moment. |
|Bratislava, Slovakia |Bratislava Symphony Goes Jazz - an amazing pops concert in a beautiful outdoor square. The Blue Church was very pretty. |It was still too hot. |
|Munich, Germany |Neuschwanstein Castle was SO BEAUTIFUL. The day trip to that and Linderhof castles was a highlight, for sure. Wandering through a Sunday market with an oom-pah band on every corner was one of my favorite experiences. I spent a bunch of hours wandering through OlympiaPark and thought it was beautiful. Did a great Beer & History walking tour. Honestly, everything in Munich was amazing. |Ned Kelly's Australian Bar did a full NFL game day experience and I was there on the first Sunday of the season. Not a cultural learning experience but SO much fun. |
|Nice, France|Opera Sur Plage Beach Club was the perfect way to spend a day bobbing in the Mediterranean. Did a convertible tour day trip to Monaco, Eiz, and a couple other small towns that was so incredibly picturesque. |Nice felt like being somewhere where the color saturation was dialed up to 120%, no matter what you were looking at. It was breathtaking. |



**Food & Drink**

I'm much more a cocktail person than a food person but here are some of my favorites: 

- Dishoom in London: one of my favorite restaurants; it never misses and this meal was no exception 

- Belly of the Beat in Amsterdam: downstairs from the famous Flying Dutchman; I loved the pirate theme (this will come up again). Law & Order Cocktail Society in Amsterdam was also great. 

- Zalipianki restaurant in Poland was bougie comfort food and had the best pickles I ate all trip. Alchemia and Singer were both great bars. 

- Needle Drop Vinyl Bar and Dino's Apothecary in Vienna were two of my favorite cocktail bars of the trip; great vibes, excellent drinks 

- Gorreshof Wirsthaus had some of the best goulash I have ever eaten. I ate there twice because I liked it so much. 

- Bistrot Jennifer in Nice was one of my favorite meals (the prawns! they were so big!) 

- The Kraken Bar in Nice was another pirate themed delight. 

  
**The ""Solo"" of It All**  

I had two moments where I very specifically thought, ""this is hard and it would be more fun if I were not alone"". I had 200,000 moments where I thought, ""I am the luckiest person in the entire world where I get to gift this experience to myself. Doing small group tours (day trips and food/drink tours) were a great way to meet people. I met a lot of nice people in bars. I met some nice people sitting in town squares. And on boat cruises. And while watching sports. And sitting next to me at the theater. I guess I'm saying that I didn't lack for company when I wanted it. I also did a bit of Hinge tourism and went on some dates, which was very fun. 

**Some Other Stats**

19th - I should be on the island by 11:00am - Visit plastic bottle village, bike rental and beach day.  
20th - Free yoga class in the morning (hopefully will meet some females in the hostel that want to go with) In the afternoon take a water taxi to starfish beach or Bird island.

28th - Check out. Pretty undecided on how ill be getting back to San Jose as I cant find that many bus options after the boat ride so I have looked into taking a plane back

San Jose Costa Rica: 

28th - Meeting a friend at the airport and staying for one night, probably just eating at a soda, hitting the pool, and market to prep food for the next day  
29th - Leave for La Fortuna by bus (debating car but still undecided)

La Fortuna Costa Rica:

29th - Arrive at a nicer hostel then ive stayed at. Will probably do a nice dinner out this night  
30th - Volcano hike and hot springs   
31st - Free day unsure of what to do, also Halloween so I imagine the hostel will have fun events  
1st - Leave by early to catch 7am bus to Nicaragua's border 

Ometepe Island Nicaragua:

1st - This is a stretch that we will make it through the border and to the ferry before the last boat leaves so prepared to sleep in Rivas for the night but otherwise we will probably get to our hostel pretty late - early night

2nd-4th Rent moterbikes to explore this island. Get a few groceries. No huge plans other than some hikes, swim, maybe take a yoga class and maybe go to a permaculture demonstration I saw online. Definitely hitting up the local farmers market  
4th - Leave to catch ferry and bus to San Juan Del Sur

San Del Sure Nicaragua:

4th-7th Not a whole lot planned other than surfing and going to the Christ of Mercy statue. Here is where we need suggestions!   
7th - Leave hostel and travel by bus to leon 

Leon Nicaragua: 

7th - Get to hostel and spend a chill night getting to know hostel mates   
8th - Visit Catedral Leon and explore the city. Our hostel does free beach trips so maybe do that  
9th - 11th No idea, maybe Volcano surfing or maybe change our reservation and spend some time in El Salvador  
11th - 12th Overnight camping trip to Telica

12th - 13th is unplanned because we need to be as close as possible to the airport. 

Personally I love traveling by bus and taking in the views so I am not to worried about that. Do you think I planned to0 many activities or too little? I like to paint so ill definitely do that during down time. I have only the first hostel that provides breakfast but almost all of the hostels have a kitchen. I plan to have almost all of my lunches and snacks prepped ahead of time to save money and also have food for travels days. I think ill plan on just a few dinners out and a few drink nights with hostel people. I am rolling on a budget as this is my trip between my seasonal work jobs. I also need to keep in mind I'm traveling in a 28l backpack so some downtime will be doing laundry. 

  
Thanks!

Just wondering if anyone here could enlighten me on the following:

Air tickets seems to cost only 400 CNY, while bullet train costs 903 CNY.  
Flight is only 2.5 hrs + 1-2 hours check-in prior, compared to 6 hrs 40min train ride.

I am currently leaning towards taking a domestic flight, but how are flights cheaper and faster than bullet train?

1.  I don't speak Mandarin, and I like to solo travel but I don't want to actually be alone the whole time.  So in terms of making friends and finding people to hang out with, have other people been able to meet English speaking locals / other travelers the speak English?  Is there a large community of international travelers in hostels or is it mostly Chinese tourism and if so have people found the vibe to be friendly/social and open to meeting new people and hanging out for the day or so?

2.  I'm used to planning everything last minute and making up the itinerary as I go.  Has anyone done this in China?  How did it go for you?  And is there anything that should definitely be planned/set up in advance?  (other than setting up WeChat and Alipay)

For those who have solo traveled there before, would you say all 3 of these are doable in 8 days or too rushed? I was thinking I could spend a few days at a hostel (recommendations welcomed) in Caye Caulker first, then a hostel (recommendations also welcomed) in San Pedro, and then make my way over to San Ignacio to see the Mayan Ruins.

solotravel,1fp3qv1,A spontaneous trip to Italy changed my life.,1737,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fp3qv1/a_spontaneous_trip_to_italy_changed_my_life/,142,"I'm a 24M, I've spent the last five years entirely focused on building my career. I’ve made solid progress, but along the way, I realized I was feeling lonely and unfulfilled. No meaningful relationships, no adventures, no new experiences. Just work.

Then, in a moment of clarity, I did something impulsive. I booked a trip to Italy, planned the whole thing in one night, and stopped making excuses. Time was slipping by, and while saving money and focusing on my career got me far, I wasn't going to get my 20s back. I couldn't stand the idea of not feeling alive. The world is too amazing to just hide at home.

So, I got on that flight with almost no expectations, ready to explore Rome and try solo travel. Little did I know, this trip would completely change how I see the world.

At the hostel, I quickly met some incredible people. Soon, I found myself canceling my pre-planned activities to hang out with them, and it was the best decision ever. I learned that good people can turn even a simple trip into something unforgettable. I'm so glad I approached them. I'm usually too self-conscious and wait for others to approach me, which is not the best strategy...

One of the best parts of traveling alone was the chance to reinvent myself. Nobody knew my past or my habits, which gave me the freedom to be a better version of myself. Being away from home let me finally grow into the person I wanted to be.

I saw this girl in the common room and felt drawn to her but didn't think much of it. Later, we accidentally bumped into each other while going out for a drink, and she bought me one. We spent the whole evening together and even exchanged necklaces before returning to our rooms. The next day, we had a magical date, like a scene from Before Sunrise, and parted ways as she returned to her country. That connection made the trip unforgettable and made me think about how meaningful it is to share moments with someone. It made me think about how important it is for me to find my wife and build a life with her.

I realized I'd burned out trying to be hyper-focused on success, thinking I was smarter than my peers. But we all need real experiences and connections to feel alive. This trip woke me up. I used to make excuses, like “travel is overrated” or ""I'll enjoy it later,"" but there's no perfect moment.

Now, I'm planning a 3-6 month trip to Asia. With no major responsibilities and a flexible schedule, I have little to lose and so much to gain. I want to feel alive again, and I'm tired of playing it safe, thinking I can just save it all for ""later.""

Traveling has made me more social and opened my eyes to how big the world truly is. I can choose where to live and what kind of life to build. The perfectionist in me still wants to hold back, but that's not living. Life happens while we're busy planning for a perfect future.

I used to fear challenges and discomfort. Now, my biggest fear is living a safe, easy life in my hometown. It's crazy how one trip can change your perspective so much.

If you're thinking about going on a trip, but aren't quite sure, just go for it. This is your sign. If you can't, do everything you can to find a way to do it. Remember, on your deathbed you'll mostly regret the things you didn't do.

**TL;DR:**

After years of prioritizing my career, I took a spontaneous trip to Italy and discovered I'd been missing out on truly living. I made new friends, met someone special, and gained a fresh perspective on life. Success and money mean little if you don’t experience the world and create memories. If you’re hesitant to travel, just go for it. You won’t regret it. You’ll return home a better person.",2024-09-25 12:54:58
solotravel,1fq2e1a,Kenya itinerary as solo female,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fq2e1a/kenya_itinerary_as_solo_female/,11,"Hello!

I'm going to Kenya in February 2025 mainly for a professional development program (2 weeks) but plan to stay for 10 days afterwards to travel around solo. During the program, I'll be visiting Nairobi, Meru, and Mount Kenya. Afterwards, I'm thinking about going to Diani Beach and doing a safari. I'm not sure which safari to do! I'd like to not move around too much - going for a more relaxing end of the trip. I'd really like to find more social opportunities such as doing a group safari. 

I'm thinking of either Masai Mara from Nairobi or Tsavo West from Diani. I'd also like to visit Hell's Gate. 

  
Here's my idea so far:

February 21 - 26: Diani Beach (I chose Diani because it seems like the most social option for a solo traveler with beautiful beaches and fun nightlife, as well as nature activities nearby) - open to hearing other suggestions!

February 28 - March 3: Nairobi, Masai Mara, Hell's Gate (my flight leaves at 11:30pm on March 3)

  
The other option is to stay in Diani Beach from February 21 - March 2, do Tsavo West from there, and then go back to Nairobi March 2 - 3 and do Hell's Gate and Nairobi National Park and whatever else seems interesting. 

My birthday is February 23rd and I'd love to do something fun that day. :)",2024-09-26 17:51:29

solotravel,1fptn37,no idea why i’m not excited ,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fptn37/no_idea_why_im_not_excited/,23,"Typing that title made me realize how stupid that sounds but it took me a LONG time to admit that statement even to myself. It’s a long post but maybe sharing it will make me feel better? And maybe someone can relate and it would make me feel less lonely or we could share our experiences about how to get through burnout time. Also, English is like my third language and I’m sorry if the grammar is off. 

Travelling was always my biggest passion. Since I was a kid I almost couldn’t sleep because of excitement before trips. Airports were my happy place and I used to go there hours before departure to just soak in the atmosphere. Every year I was counting days until my next trip, and I fell in love especially with Middle East. I loved travelling solo, the freedom of it, the excitement. I never felt homesick or lonely, I’m a huge introvert and always met the most incredible people on my way, so that really helped. 

This year in April I lost my job but I had quite some savings so instead of looking for another I decided to finally take a gap year. Spent month in Morocco, then some time in Berlin, then 5 weeks in Jordan. I’ve had the most amazing time, fell in love with diving, spent a lot of time volunteering in diving centres and decided that’s something I want to do. Then I got back to my country, spent summer here because it’s really nice here during that time and I imidiately started to plan next trip. I always dreamed of escaping cold Polish winter, so I contacted few diving centres and I was able to land nice volunteering opportunity - in Jordan for whole October and then 3 months in Egypt. Dream come true - amazing reefs, beautiful weather, great culture. I was looking through dozens of YouTube videos about the places I’ll see, learning language, looking through Google Maps to check out all the locations. 

But for some reason, I’m leaving my country on Sunday, and for the first time in my life I’m not excited. I don’t even want to go. I feel anxious, burned out. Of course I will go, but there is no thrill. I think that because of many trips this year, travelling is not exciting anymore and I’m heartbroken because of that. I never thought this might happen. I will be visiting my favourite places on earth, meeting the most beautiful people, spending days diving which I love the most, and for some reason I just don’t feel happy because of that. 

I’m trying to embrace this feeling as a part of a journey but I’m just so frustrated. I won’t have an opportunity like that when I’ll get my job back and I always dreamed of spending months in travel and now, when I finally get it, it got boring? I’m really annoyed with myself and I try to be understanding and kind to myself but it’s hard. 

Sorry for the rant. I think typing that all and getting it off my head helped a bit? Have you ever been in a similar situation or felt similar way? Or maybe even lost a passion for travelling for a longer time? ",2024-09-26 11:13:09
solotravel,1fph8dv,The Best Things That I Ate Over 7.5 Months in SE Asia And Where I Ate Those Things,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fph8dv/the_best_things_that_i_ate_over_75_months_in_se/,43,"Hi! 

Notes:

* There’s a lot of Thai stuff on here, and a lot in Bangkok. Thai food is great, Bangkok is an awesome food city.
* This list is not exhaustive (I ate far too many nice things to remember all of them) but these are the ones that I remember enjoying the most. If anyone who reads this enjoys one thing from this list then it’s done its job.
* It's also not in any particular order (apart from #1 and #2, which fully occupy their respective spots by some margin).
* Remember that food is a gateway to an experience shared! Go enjoy these with someone else (ideally someone that you’ve just met) if you can. You’re more likely to build a positive memory of getting a great meal if you do.

**Laphet Thoke** (Burmese, but easily accessed in Thailand) **(V)**

Where: *The Swan, Chiang Mai*

What is it: *Tea leaves that are fermented underground mixed with roasted peanuts for crunch, diced tomatoes, and a rich pesto dressing binding everything together.* 

*While this list is in no particular order, this is the best thing. It goes at the top. I’d never really considered hitting up a Burmese restaurant until two gay men were showing us their sexy waterfall pics in the back of a Tuk-Tuk to pass the time on the drive back (they were killing it) and then told us to head to The Swan in Chiang Mai. The version at The Swan uses more lettuce than I saw other versions use, but I'm not joking when I say that I thought about this salad every day for four months like Captain Ahab thought of Moby Dick. I got back to Thailand and ate it every day before I left again.*

**Salt Coffee** (Vietnam) **(V)**

Where: *Salt Mate in Hanoi or Madame Quyen in HCMC ‘Cafe Apartments’.*

What is it?: *Coffee (usually robusta), non-dairy creamer whipped with Himalayan salt, condensed milk, served over ice.*

*Egg coffee is 100% the most popular, traditional, and well-known coffee option in Vietnam, but this is a fairly recent addition to Vietnamese coffee menus. The salt highlights the savoury flavour (those aren't spelling errors, Reddit, stop trying to tell me there's no u in words) while also muting the sweetness of the condensed milk (don’t get me wrong, it’s still sweet). Enjoy it in the same way you’d enjoy egg coffee - a few spoonfuls of the sweetened cream on top on its own, then thoroughly mix the layers of coffee and cream together after that. I required two of these a day in Vietnam. I still get the itch when I mention it.*

**Mala Hotpot** (Singapore, but it's probably Chinese)

Where: *Lau Pa Sat Hawker Food Market*

What is it: *Chunks of pressed firm tofu stir fried wĺith ground pork. Served in a gravy that is more numbing than actually spicy, due to Sichuan peppercorns being the primary ingredient.*

*Look, I know that Lau Pa Sat is the touristy hawker market! Yes, there are more ‘authentic’ ones, I went to those too! This one was my last meal in Singapore and I honestly could have eaten it for breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. Something about Sichuan peppercorns are just incredibly moreish, given that they don't burn, they just tingle.*

**Nasi Lemak**

Where: Edit:  I thought this was Indonesian but it’s not - it’s from Malaysia. I got this from Lau Pa Sat in Singapore as well.*

What is it?: *Rice cooked in coconut milk, served with a fried egg, and crispy peanuts and anchovies for topping. At Lau Pa Sat you also get a chicken leg. The best thing about it is the Sambal (chilli sauce) which is spicy, tangy, and smoky.*

*When the young people say 'Please don't get lost in the sauce', I assume they're not talking about Sambal, which I would put on everything if I had the choice. Also, take your anchovy hate somewhere else. They're why Caesar dressing tastes so good and they're also the best extra pizza topping. Fry from Futurama had it right.*

**Pad Ka Phrow** (Thailand)

Where: *Anywhere Thai food is sold*

What is it?: *Ground pork stir fried at high heat with Thai finger chillies, garlic, and holy basil. Serve with rice and a fried egg.*

*I don't need to sell this one. It's cheap, it's spicy, it's tasty as hell. Perfect example of a good Thai dish. Also not sure regular Italian basil is going to cut it for me anymore.*

**Water Buffalo and Pumpkin Curry** (Laos)

Where:  *Saibaidee Restuarant, Pakbeng*

*Likely the only reason you’ll find yourself in Pakbeng is because you’re doing the two day slow boat from Huay Xai to Luang Prabang, as this is where it stops overnight. There’s really not much to Pakbeng at all, but we did end up at this French inspired restaurant in the middle of town. Really scratched the itch I had for a thicker curry after two months of soup curries in Thailand.*

**Sticky Rice with the spicy soy sauce that comes with every meal in Laos** (Laos)

Where: *A meal with literally any Laotian family*

*I signed up to go on a 2 day, 1 night hike while I was in Nong Khiaw. Part of that was staying with a Laotian family, who prepared a simple home meal for us (roasted pumpkin soup, dressed cabbage, pork noodles, sticky rice, spicy soy sauce, homemade moonshine). I honestly can't tell if it was because I was starving after 7 hours hiking through the countryside, but this was one of the best meals I remember eating on the entire trip. Sat cross legged in a room around a tiny table lit with candles, everything was so simple, flavorful and fresh, and you could tell a lot of the ingredients were local to the farms around the village. A ball of sticky rice in your hands dipped into that sauce is an absolute flavour bomb and I miss it everyday.*

**Bahn Mi** (Vietnam)

Where: *Bahn Mi 25 in Hanoi, or Bahn Mi Sai Gon in Hoi An*

*Easy one. You can get these on the street for about 20,000 VND. You can get more expensive versions anywhere you care  to look. For many the battle for the best is between Bahn Mi 25 in Hanoi and Madam Khan in Hoi An, although I prefer Bahn Mi Sai Gon just down the road from there.*

**Lechon Baboy (Whole pit roasted pig) (The Philippines)**

Where: *This is a special occasion thing in the Philippines and generally not something you'll just see on every street. It either gets roasted to order or you'll have to find a specific restaurant that revolves around it. Ask a Filipino, they're really nice!*

*I found this entirely by chance - I went to a pharmacy to pick up some painkillers and the family that owned it had an entire lechón pig on a table outside for a birthday party. They insisted I joined them and I did. I read something that described this as ‘sinful’ somewhere and they’re absolutely right - fatty, melty, tender with crunchy glass-like skin.*

**Duck Noodles** 

Where to try: Hongkong Dimsun and Noodle, Bangkok (outside The Jam Hostel/Mad Monkey), or 995 Roasted Duck, Koh Tao

*There is a rule that I formulated in SE Asia where if you see roasted duck hung up over a cart outside the restaurant, it’s a good place. I was never wrong. Simple, dirt cheap, never disappointing, always leaves room for a second bowl. HongKong Dimsum and Noodle should be a stop for everyone in the backpacker district of Bangkok, it's excellent.*

**Lemongrass Roasted Goat (Vietnam)**

Where to try: Trang An, Vietnam

*Most backpackers visiting ‘Ninh Binh’ will actually stay in Tam Coc, 3 miles outside the city itself. Trang An is just north of there, and is a better place to stay IMO. You'll see restaurants around that have whole goats just hung on a spit out front, they're the ones you want to head to. Just don't do a hike up any mountains beforehand because you will see a goat and they will be very cute.*

**Order #4**

Where to try: *Pho Viet Nam, Ho Chi Minh City*

*Just go and read the bit in Anthony Bourdain's ‘Medium Raw’ on Pho. It'll make you want some, even though I think the point of those pages was to criticise food porn writers. At this place, it comes with the broth boiling in a stone bowl and all of your veggies, herbs, and additional meat on the side. Just plonk the things that you want in and let the boiling soup cook them slightly before eating that mouthful, and repeat. Scald your mouth a bunch and then go back the next night to do it again.*

**Everything I Ordered At Datta Bananaleaf (Don Det, Laos)**

Where: *Datta Bananaleaf, Don Det, Laos*

*First, don't skip Don Det. It's tiny, there's not a great deal to see, and it's a pain in the arse to get to. Genuinely one of the best places you’ll go if you’ve got the time to stay a few nights.* 

*Small Sri-Lankan place on Don Det (sidebar - there are lots of great western owned places to eat on Don Det). Always packed out in the evenings and service is quite slow as it’s just run by a husband and wife. Go for a late breakfast for much faster service and a quieter atmosphere. Ordering the samosas is essential, and I really enjoyed the Palak Paneer. One of those places where you’ll eat at twice a day once you’ve got the taste for it.*

**Stir Fried Morning Glory**

Where: *Anywhere in Thailand*

*After a while, you're gonna want some greens. A lot of greens. A lot of greens, for cheap, stir fried in garlic and soy sauce. This is that. Great lunch, and if you're super hungry, get it with rice.*

**Pad Thai (Thailand)**

Where to try: *Thipsamai, Bangkok*

What is it: *The only thing you’re brave enough to order from your local Thai place*

*Yes, I'm recommending the Pad Thai. If you thought I wasn't going to go hardcore basic bitch on you, you were wrong. I said for months that I f\*\*\*ed up by eating at Thipsamai so early in my trip, because no other Pad Thai really held a candle after that. Very specifically scheduled my last SE Asia meal to be here.*

**The Famous Perpetual Stew**

Where: *Wattana Panich, Ekkamai, Bangkok*

*Get off the SkyTrain at Ekkamai station and walk about 15 minutes up the street to this small roadside bistro, immediately identifiable because there's a huge pot of stew boiling outside. They'll give you a menu, but you just point at the stew, and you'll get that. It's on Atlas Obscura if you want to read more about it. Now, theoretically, this thing has been cooking for 45 years, but realistically they just preserve a little bit of stew each day, make a fresh batch, and add the old stew to it, so it's technically got those 45 year flavours. It's pretty banging.*

**Jok (Thailand)**

Where to try: *Jok Prince, Bangkok*

What is it: *Congee/rice porridge.*

*I liked the one at Jok Prince because it had a looser consistency and a smoky flavour that didn't seem to be present at the other places I tried. Congee is also a very good option when you inevitably get Bangkok belly and don’t take a solid dump for about a week, just get it plain.*

**Any Noodle Shop In Thailand**

*We’re getting to that bit that must happen in every list where I'm running out of steam and I need to get a bit general. Amongst the hubbub of late night Thai towns, the businesses long shuttered for the night and the bars on the verge of doing the same, the sterile fluorescent lights of a noodle place spills out onto the street. You sit down at a nondescript cheap metal table, and a laminated menu is flung at you at lightning speed. Just as soon as your finger touches the page, the menu is ripped away from you and replaced with a plastic bowl of soul-healing noodles. The condiment basket is there to be used - throw absolutely everything in, stir, and slurp. What a time.*

**Beef Noodle Salad (Bun Bo Nam)**

Where to try: *Bun Bo Nam Bach Phuong, Ha Noi*

What is it: *Sticky rice noodles with stir-fried beef, peanuts, and a sweet tasting broth.*

*I think this one is actually more famous in the south of Vietnam. Nevertheless, this is where I had it and loved it. I found this place through a walking food tour, which is the first thing you should do when you get to any big city.*

**And as a bonus, my favourite cafes!**

**Istoria Hostel, Moalboal, Phillipines**

*Best coffee I had on my trip. They know what they’re doing there.* 

**Shanti Shanti, Siargao, Phillipines**

*There are a lot of western style brunch places in General Luna on Siargao. If they serve sourdough, chances are Shanti Shanti bakes it for them. Wonderful chill out spot, but a little out the way, so renting a scooter is advisable. Coffee, dark chocolate cookies, and the ‘rustic’ sandwich isn’t the most Filipino thing out there, but if it doesn't restore your mood after falling off a surfboard 30 times, nothing will.*

**Khom Chocolate House, Chiang Mai, Thailand**

*Pretty much everything sold here is absolutely bomb. I remember the brownie bites and the gravity chocolate basically sending me upstairs to meet god for like two seconds. You can also buy their products, like dried drinking chocolate flakes, to take home with you.*

I live in Berlin and enjoy ""soft techno"" / tech house / funky edm and enough dancing expressively, if I like the music. Usually I go to queer / lgbt-friendly and sometimes sex-positive parties as opposed to all-male shirtless sex-parties. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of any kind of ""show"" at a party, be it drag or half-baked dancers.

solotravel,1fq22ba,I can't decide how I want to travel Australia,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fq22ba/i_cant_decide_how_i_want_to_travel_australia/,27,"Hello, I (25M) am an East Coast American who is planning to make a solo trip to Australia sometime at the start of next year. My initial plan was to do a 2–3 month trip where I would start by traveling with a youth travel group from Melbourne to Cairns and then I would then fly to Port Lincoln to go cage diving (the main bucket list reason for my trip) and head home from there. However, the more research I do, the more I'm considering the possibility of doing a work holiday down there.

For context, I had no set plans after I completed undergrad a few years back and have since been living back at home where I have mainly just been working (job not related to what I studied) and saving up money while I figure out what I'm doing. The idea of the whv interests me in that this is the perfect time for me to do something like this as far as I am still young, I have money saved up, and I have nothing holding me back as far as a spouse, kids, or a career currently (I plan to leave my current job before I go to Australia regardless) and doing this would allow me to see more of Australia and the surrounding area, meet more people, and not lose as much money as I would on just doing a regular tourist trip as long as I am able to find work. However, part of me is absolutely terrified of committing to something like that on the other side of the world; I would absolutely miss my family and pets and surely would become homesick at some times, but part of me feels that that is part of the reason as to why I should maybe do it, to become a more independent person and do something adventurous like this before life gets too busy.

So, with all that being said, I guess I am asking for advice on what I should do based on my current situation or if anyone has any similar experiences that they are willing to share on how they made a decision on something like this. 

Is now a good time to just go for it and go on a work holiday to Australia? Should I go on a normal travel visa first and then decide from there if I would want to come back on a work holiday visa later? Has anyone done something similar to that and if so, how did you do it? 

Any responses, advice, or shared experiences will be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: Based on my situation, should I take a work holiday to Australia or play it safe and just do a regular tourist trip instead?

I’m planning on a week 9 total days, from Nov 16 - 24. 

Mostly a photography/exploring trip. Walking all day taking photos, hopping into restaurants and bars for food/drinks, museums, castles. It’ll be my first time in Europe, traveled to SE often. 

I was initially thinking basing in Lisbon and having a few day trips, especially one to Sintra. Now reading into it a bit further, should I split it to 5 days Lisbon and 2 days in Porto? 

It’d require some more careful planning, with flights to Porto back and forth. Seems a bit tight.. and tbh after my last trip to Japan with my wife that was very carefully planned, I’d like to plan a bit less for this trip.

Feeling down, looking for morale support...

I'm 10 days into a 3 month trip, my partner is coming out to join me for a few weeks in the middle so it's only about 3 more weeks solo for now but it's still a lot of alone time. I'm in Cuba atm and only just speak enough Spanish to get by which is really tiring. It's raining so all the concerts and shows I wanted to see in Havana are cancelled, and last night I slipped in my sandals and hurt one of my toes quite badly so had to cancel the dance class I was planning on taking today. I'm staying in Centro and it's a bit of a walk into the old town, and being a solo female and not finding many other tourists to hang out with I'm not sure about going out late at night anyway so i feel like I'm missing out on what Cuba is all about if I can't go out and dance.

I've booked a car for Trinidad tomorrow so will have a few days there for a change of scene, hopefully there'll be enough to do and see while I'm hobbling about in the rain.

Feeling like I've made a poor decision coming here alone in the off season... How do you guys deal with days like these, and how do you meet other travellers when it's low season? The advantage of a longer trip is that not every day needs to go well but I'm just feeling a bit like I haven't had enough highs to counter the lows so far...

As a 59m that has never really been apart from loved ones I was a bit apprehensive if I could pull it off.  

So far so good.  Due to limited funds I’m focusing on lesser expensive areas of Europe. With kids and when I was younger I have been to Paris, Amsterdam etc so I can sort of compare with my recent destinations. 

I have a post somewhere with my earlier stops in Austria, Hungary and part of Romania. So I’ll pick up on where things really changed for me. 

I had already found comfort somewhat in being alone, in realizing I had already done pretty good on navigating and that I can actually function without being around someone familiar. 
After Bucharest, Romania I decided to wing it to Brasov, Romania with my newfound wisdom. 

Brasov was wonderful.  Easy access from my little apartment to an amazing city full of wonder. 

Headed to Ruse, Bulgaria.  Veliko Tarnovo then to the oldest city in Europe, Plovdiv Bulgaria. 
Now I find myself spending time in the Burgas/Nessebar area of the Black Sea in Bulgaria.  

From Brasov to where I am now was done mainly by train and one bus.  I utilize the public transport and although not perfect it is good enough to get me to where I need

I am spending in this area less than $200 a week for accommodations and about $150 on food and beer.  One meal out and grocery for everything else. 

Monthly rent, if I decide to stay, is about $500-600 here at the Black Sea with internet and all utilities.  Not too bad.  It is on my hit list if I ever become a “digital nomad”

I speak only English and have no bad experiences.  I do try to get the basic greetings down but the vast majority of young people speak some English and have been great.  

Highly recommend any of the cities I slept in.  Plenty of natural beauty, historical sites and places to sit and think.  

I could literally start a book. It if anyone has questions regarding them I can give some input or pass along the hosts for where I slept. 

Here’s a short recap of cities after Geneva (which was not my cup of tea)

Lustenau, Austria.
Graz, Austria. 
Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
Zagreb, Croatia.  
Budapest, Hungary. 
Brasov and Bucharest Romania. 
Ruse, Veliko Tarnovo, Sofia, Plovdiv and Nessebar Bulgaria.  

Wonderful, all of them, in one way or another.  ",2024-09-26 04:16:23

I recently had to cancel my first trip to Japan and I can't help but feel a little defeated.

For context, I have never traveled internationally nor have I done much traveling alone. I had this trip booked out months and adavance and was very excited about it at first.

Then, about a week before my trip, the stress started getting to me. I was barely sleeping and the excitement started to wane. A couple of days before I was set to leave, I was exhausted but still felt pretty hopeful until we received news that my fiancées best friend died.

She encouraged me to go, as did many others around me, but this just threw another layer of stress on top of things. It again robbed me of sleep and led me into a spiral, which just made me not excited about the trip again. So, I made the last minute decision to cancel my trip.

Thankfully, everything was refundable. Although, I'm left feeling defeated. I feel like I won't be able to do this trip solo in the future and when I try to reschedule it I will be haunted by these feelings and end up in stressful whirlwind again.

I was wondering if anyone else has canceled a big solo trip before due to stress and anxiety and if they were able to recover and go on the trip in the future. I would love to hear your stories!",2024-09-25 11:31:58

I'm currently at south Thailand, I am here for about 3 weeks now, been to Phuket, Phi Phi, Koh Lanta, Krabi, Ao Nang, Railay Beach and now I am at Koh Yao Yai.

Koh Yao Yai is currently deserted, I'm the only one in my hostel, which is the only hostel on the island. I wanted to go to Hong Island but there are no other sign ups so my only option is private boat, which is really expensive. 

In Railay and Krabi there were barely any tourist as well, so hostel activities got canceled while I was there, and the bars were almost empty and closed early.

I still had nice time in Railay, did kayaking and I was the only person on Tonsai beach, it was very nice. Rasta bars were nice and I enjoyed chilling there and smoking for first time, but it still sucked to be there when there are just 2 other people.

I am not sure what should I do next, wanted to go to Koh Yao Noi but scared there will be no one there as well, same for Koh Lak and Koh Sok.

It also makes me realize how different the lives of the local people than the tourist scene, as there are no locals at these places and without tourist the places just close.

Some girl at Railay told me she did some solo travel before and she's glad she's traveling with a friend this time because while things are close and there are not so many people you feel it less when you're with someone, didn't think about it until she told me that.",2024-09-25 12:50:37

It has brought me peace and happiness I hadn't felt in a long time (although I got yelled at a few times- it was my bad tbh).

Anyways, here are things I've liked so far about travelling solo...

* I can stop and listen to street musicians for half an hour (I even ended up talking to one) without anyone talking to me or getting impatient. 

* I can clap without feeling embarrassed.

* If I am with people and get tired (I'm a social introvert- I have a few hours of social battery before I deflate like a punctured beach ball) I can just excuse myself and leave. I don't have the social compromise of waiting for anyone.

* Exept for a few anxiety moments, I have gained so much confidence.

* The silence is great! Being alone means only having conversations if I feel like it.

* I can go back to the dorm or room when I want and rest before going out again, I don't depend on the energy levels of anyone else.

And many things more, but my favorite thing:

**Petting street cats for as long as I want.**

This is joyous so far, and I hope it continues like this.

You saw it, you experienced it. Maybe truly by yourself or even with other travelers/locals but ultimately you’re the one who goes back home and tells this story that only you can recite.     
    
There is always that one event though that really sticks out. Where it feels like a dream or a feeling that you got that you crave desperately again. I’d love to hear what that is for everyone.     
    
For me, that moment was in Tokyo. I was two days into my trip and went out for dinner. It turns out the restaurant I had planned to go to had closed due to some issue. I ended up drifting down random side streets in Shibuya and spotted a little place to stop into. As the night progressed I made friends with a group of locals out celebrating one’s birthday. I especially clicked with one of the women in the group.     
    
The both of us ended up out staying out that night for hours until we to meet up the next day for lunch. Just lunch turned into us hanging out all day. Eventually leading us onto the rooftop of her apartment surrounded. We were surrounded by the lights and sounds of Shinjuku while went through a bottle of Sake. We talked about our lives, hardships, goals. We were both wearing our hearts on our sleeves that night. It was incredibly cathartic for both of us. We then fell asleep against each other as the sun was rising. 
    
It was one of those memories that I can close my eyes and almost feel like I’m there again. I’ll cherish it forever and it’s all thanks to the spontaneousness that solo travel brings. Meeting a lifelong friend and bonding like that with someone on the entirely different side of the world. ",2024-09-24 08:06:44

It was a good relationship but I wanted to travel more and he was ready to settle down and start a family, and travel wasn’t a priority (well, 3 weeks vacation a year sufficed for him).

I was handling the breakup decently but I recently saw photos of him living his best life with a new gf and I feel like I’m back to square 1. Been feeling down for the last month but in the week ish since seeing the pics i spiralled into a depressive state. All I wanna do is cry and isolate. 

Anyways, I’ve been planning a 4ish month long South America trip even before I started spiralling. Longest solo trip I’ve done was 1.5 months but I was in the relationship at the time and felt so secure and confident. Now I feel like a shell of myself, so insecure and not the same person I was before this breakup. 

I haven’t booked this trip yet but I’m not sure if I should go on it… the desire for long term travel was one of the reasons we broke up, but I’m wondering if I’m too low to enjoy the trip. I don’t want to go on this amazing experience and not be able to enjoy it because I’m in a deep hole of sadness, or because I’m thinking of how much he would have enjoyed the beautiful sights I’ll be seeing, and that we can’t be there together 😓

Since our lifestyle desires were a big part of our breakup decision, if I don’t go it will make me regret this breakup even more. If I’m not gonna follow through with my plans why did we even break up?

Has a long solo trip helped you build your confidence up after a breakup and improved your mental health? I’m worried of making the wrong decision again.

Even though I'm not massively into them, I'm aware that this region has some of the best beaches in the world, so maybe I should see them. And as a solo traveller I could keep busy there by trying something new, like scuba diving. So I'm wondering about switching up the itinerary to try to fit that in.

I've tried to work things around to head to the more typical beach/island locations (Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Phuket, etc), but it takes me in the wrong direction and I'm not sure I can justify that when I've already got a pretty tight schedule. So I'm wondering if there are some other alternatives nearer to my planned route, which I could add in without messing existing plans up by any more than 2-3 days. I was wondering about somewhere along the Vietnamese coast, somewhere to the south of Cambodia, somewhere to the southwest of Phnom Penh, or somewhere no more than 4 hours travel from Bangkok. 

Does anybody have any recommendations?",2024-09-24 09:53:13

A few notes:

* Flying into Lima on Monday around noon and can either fly immediately to Cusco when I arrive on Monday, or would spend a day or so in Lima before heading to Cusco.
* Need to be in Cusco overnight for an event afternoon Friday to Saturday night but will have time to explore while there
* I want to see as much of Cusco and the Sacred Valley as possible, including Ollantaytambo, Pisac, Moray & Maras, Urubamba, etc.
* I want to go up to Machu Picchu and back on Thursday

Rather than spending $500+ on a tour package, does anyone have **recommendations as to where to stay, what sequence, and the best route through those sites given the above parameters?**

After the Sacred Valley/Cusco/MC segment, I also have all day Sunday and Monday to find somewhere else to explore/see before heading back in Lima to fly out of the country on a redeye Monday night. **Any recommendations as to the best region or city to visit given that I only have those 2 days?** Thinking Lake Titicaca or Arequipa?

solotravel,1fnt88k,"Trip report, 3 weeks in France as a solo female traveler",168,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fnt88k/trip_report_3_weeks_in_france_as_a_solo_female/,40,"Just getting back from 3 weeks in France, I spent a lot of time before while planning this trip looking at this subreddit and others to gather information. Generally France is a pretty safe pick as a solo female traveler, but for me it was personally important as I spent a long time studying the French language and culture and have always enjoyed it. 

Now I knew that I could not do the hostel thing, I have insomnia and sleep anxiety. I did a lot of research and price comparing between hotels vs hostels. If you can do it great, but it’s not my thing and for sleeping I really like my own space/privacy. I know some hostels have private rooms but price wise they were not worth it for me. Budgeting wise, I saved up lots of earned time for this trip and saved over the years working through the pandemic so I did not try to limit myself in terms of budget too much. I would say I spent roughly 6k including flights, train tickets, food and everything else. 

For my itinerary I spent 5 days in Paris, 3 days in Strasbourg, 3 in Annecy, 4 days in Nice, 1 night in Toulouse, 3 days in Tours, and I stayed near the airport the last night to lessen the stress of international travel. I maybe would have planned my route more efficiently knowing what I know now about France’s high speed train system but that’s ok, it’s not a huge deal and I enjoyed every place I visited. 

The highs and lows:

Lows 
1. I definitely had a panic attack when I got to my hotel in Paris, the combination of no sleep basically in over 24 hours, being on the tail end of a cold, and anxiety manifesting into physical symptoms was a recipe for misery. But I forced myself to go for a walk, and then I was hit with the emotions and the joy of getting to live out my dream. French nausea medicine that you can get OTC is also a life saver 

2. Some really long days on the train, like 7 or 8 hours. But now I can say I’m more confident with the transport system

3. The social awkwardness of eating alone, I ate in a lot of restaurants by myself. Kinda wish I had a kindle or something but I have a hard time focusing on reading in a public place like that. I’m used to scarfing down my lunch at work, eating slower is hard but I tried my best. I journaled. But eating alone surrounded by people who are with friends definitely makes loneliness hit the hardest 

4. At the end of my trip I started to feel just a lot more tired and my mood was lower. I think it was a combination of loneliness and fatigue, but it’s good for me to know that around 2-3 weeks is probably my personal limit for solo traveling. Don’t get me wrong I still enjoyed my time, and I would still do things I enjoy solo and find joy in them. I had some group day tours and things planned and that really helped with my loneliness. 

5. For safety reasons had to be conscientious of how I dressed, and even wearing modest clothes I would still get stared down by random men. But whatever, no one did anything outright scandalous 

The Highs:

1. I love France, there is so much beauty in the history, the art, the architecture and the culture. For me it was like my fantasies coming to life. 
2. I love solo travel, I love having control over everything, just being able to get up and go and do my thing and not worry about anyone else. Yes, loneliness happens, but I am very comfortable overall in being alone. I did so many cool things that maybe I wouldn’t have been able to do if I was with other people.

3. Paris monuments at sunrise, holy moly this was a game changer. So quiet and peaceful, I wasn’t even planning on going to the Eiffel Tower - but I woke up early one day and went to see it from the Trocaderos, there was only a handful of people there. Truly a highlight of this trip

4. Speaking French to actual French people! This was so rewarding, even if it was challenging and humbling at times as I haven’t practiced French in 6 years. And I don’t know if they were just being nice to me but multiple French people told me my French sounded good. I had a conversation with a woman who worked at a cafe in Paris, mostly in French, and it just was so nice. 

5. Meeting other travelers along the way. Even if they were short encounters with people I may never see again, I enjoyed them and they made my trip a lot more fun. 

6. Proving it to myself that I can do this. Despite some of the emotional lows, I’m so happy I did this trip. I don’t think solo travel is for everyone, but it is for me. 

I have a lot of other things that I did that I enjoyed, I’m really grateful I was able to go on this trip, though I worked my ass off for it. I learned a lot from it and it will help me plan more trips in the future, I definitely will be returning to France someday and other countries that I’ve wanted to visit. Sorry for any typos/ grammar issues - this is kind of a brain dump. ",2024-09-23 19:34:32

Why I travel? I honestly can care less about tourist spots. I love to learn about anyone and their culture from around the world. I want to eat like a local in Asia slurping noodles with a spoon and chopsticks and experience football games by screaming your head off in Europe. 

How I started is when I met my neighbors who were from Mexico and I grew up playing soccer with the kids. They kept talking about their home and how different it was in the states northeast region. Then I watched a lot of TV about the rest of the world and intrigued how most of middle east eat with only their right hand.

solotravel,1fnfej7,Trip of a lifetime turned into a bit of a nightmare ,176,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fnfej7/trip_of_a_lifetime_turned_into_a_bit_of_a/,230,"Currently on day 5 of an 8 day trip. 1st day was as expected, excited to be experiencing a new culture, sent pictures home of how great it all was and then I got sick. Everything I eat is now causing stomach pain or diarrhoea, and the heat has completely wiped any remaining energy I have and I'm really struggling with sleep.

For the last 4 days I've barely left the hotel, partly due to the heat but mainly for fear of not being near a toilet. This was a really expensive trip too and I scrimped and saved for a year to pay for it, and also means I can't afford to cut the trip short and buy a plane ticket home, which in turn has now triggered a depressive episode as 1- I feel somewhat trapped, and 2- I feel ashamed because I'm failing at enjoying myself.

I know this is all daft, as some things can't be helped, but I'm really dreading going home and having everyone ask how great it was and to see pictures, but not having many to show and then to explain how it's actually been pretty awful. Or do I just lie and say it was the best time of my life?

I thought I'd post here as I don't want to speak with anyone from home right now as it will only make them worry. Has anyone ever had anything similar happen? And how did you cope with the feeling of wasting a trip of a lifetime?

Also, for new solo travellers, don't let this put you off, I have solo travelled before and had a great time.

GLA - LHR 
LHR - TPE 
TPE - SYD

I have a bag I will be checking in Glasgow. I was wondering if they will transfer my checked bag for me or if I have to pick it up in London and recheck it. The first flight (GLA - LHR) is a British Airways flight and CA is not allowing me to check in for that flight on their website (apparently I have to do it in-person at the BA desk when I check my bag in Glasgow.) I was just wondering if these are treated as two separate tickets and I have to recheck my bag or if the airline will transfer it for me. I booked both flights as one ticket on the China Airlines website.

Additional info:
• My receipt/itinerary for the China Airlines transaction shows that they are connecting flights with a layover, they do not have a shared flight code.
• All other correspondence that I have received from China Airlines concerning my flight makes no mention of a flight from Glasgow to London at all.
• I was never given any sort of reservation number or check-in information for my British Airways flight.

**Day 2: Get visa for Bolivia and fly to Arequipa**

Spend the day getting the Bolivian visa and exploring Lima with whatever time I have left, then head to the airport and catch the latest flight to Arequipa. (7:30PM on JetSmart). Latest flight to give myself time just incase I have complications getting the visa.

**Day 3-4: Arequipa, flying to Cusco and train to Aguas Calientes day 4**

No idea what to do or where to stay in Arequipa, but I know I want to try and fly to Cusco first thing in the morning day 4 and catch the train to AC to spend the night there. Are there any differences between the two train companies? Which one should I take?

This day is a little packed, but I think I can manage it. The bus leaves Cusco in the evening and gets to Puno in the early morning, does a little tour, then to Copacabana, another tour of Isla del Sol, then finishes in La Paz.

No idea of what I want to do or where to stay here. This is where I might add a day.

**Day 13: Beginning my flight home**

The most comfortable way for me to get home from La Paz looks like it would be to leave on a 3:30PM flight and have an overnight layover in Bogota before continuing on home. I'd get a hotel in Bogota.

solotravel,1fnc7w7,Where my extroverted introverts at?,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fnc7w7/where_my_extroverted_introverts_at/,48,"I’d say I’m fundamentally an introvert - social situations drain me and I need to recharge. But, I love being around people, meeting new people, going out and having fun, blah blah blah. It just takes extra effort. 

Sometimes these two sides feel so at odds during solo travel. My body might be in introvert mode (tired, retreated), but because I’m in a new city I feel like a failure if I’m not living it up and making new friends or having some hot hookup. I am gay and validation seeking is kind of a toxic trait of gay male culture. 

Anyways, I’m currently in Brazil and struggling with this tension. I’ve been sooo tired but feel like I can’t just sit in this Airbnb after traveling so far. This is country #4 on this trip and all others were Spanish speaking. I am nowhere near fluent but know enough to have conversations and approach people in an extroverted way with my Spanish. In Brazil I feel socially castrated bc I can’t speak the language and most ppl do not really speak English or Spanish here.

You’d think this would be a good time to let introversion kick in but holy shit the FOMO and inadequacy is badddd for me bc Brazilians are super super outgoing and social. You’re surrounded by extreme extroversion and can’t participate if you can’t speak the language. It’s really getting to me, having to watch all these gorgeous and charismatic people have an amazing time and all I can do is awkwardly observe.

solotravel,1fndpdk,Trip Report: 2 weeks in Spain and Portugal,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fndpdk/trip_report_2_weeks_in_spain_and_portugal/,17,"I love this community and wanted to contribute my thoughts on Spain and Portugal, coming for a vacation from the USA. 

Budget: 4K(ish)
Duration: 14 days
Destinations: Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Granada, Cordoba, Lisbon

Highlights:

Barcelona: Using one of the bike rental apps (Donkey Republic) was straightforward, cheap, and amazing. This is a 10/10 recommendation and will only cost you a few euro. Barcelona was among my favorite cities on my itinerary to walk at night - the Gaudi architecture is even more surreal, the gothic cathedral more dramatic. I loved seeing the Sagrada Familia around 7 to see soft evening light filter through and wandering until it closed.

Madrid: Retiro Park is a must-go and doesn’t cost anything. Puerto del Sol at night was great for live music, break dancing, spontaneous fun at night. I took a day trip to Segovia, which was a highlight of my trip. It’s not far, and you can soak up the sights in Segovia in half a day (beautiful castle, huge Roman aqueduct)

Seville: it made sense to me to visit Granada and Cordoba if I was going to Seville, they’re all a few hours apart by high-velocity train. What most people are after is a Flamenco show. I skipped the high-priced dinner shows (many were 40, 50, 60+ euro) and opted to see live flamenco buskers in the Plaza de España. I got the singing and dancing I was after and I got to take it in with beautiful architecture and a fountain as a backdrop. Not as intimate as a dinner show, but a good alternative for solo travelers on the go or those that are particularly budget-conscious. Don’t miss the Setas! People were generally polite about taking turns on the giant “I heart Seville” sign if you’re into that sort of photo op.

Granada: Obvious highlight is the Alhambra. Here’s what I wish I had known before I went to Granada: if you want to see the sunset from San Nicolas, GO EARLY. I tried to go 40 minutes before sunset and the entire railing was already taken. I think TikTok made this famous, you gotta go early if you want a nice shot. Well worth it though, really lively crowd up there and the best views you’ll get.

Cordoba: Maybe a controversial take, but if your itinerary only allows EITHER Cordoba or Granada, choose Cordoba! The Mezquita was the most impressive thing I saw in the trip, with the exception of the Sagrada. Cordoba at night along the Roman bridge is about as good as it gets for a night time stroll. 

Lisbon: Old town (Alfama) deserves its own afternoon of wandering separate from the Torre de Belém area. Lots of good food and the most charm per capita I saw except for maybe Segovia’s Jewish Quarter. You don’t need to wait in line at the Pasteis de Nata place to get a good pastel de Nata near Belem, there are a handful of places that aren’t internet famous that have great tarts. What I wish I would have known: if you want to take a ferry in Lisbon (likely to get to the Christ statue) show up earlier than you would to catch a metro or bus. I was part of a huge crowd that couldn’t make it on the ferry and had to sit shoulder to shoulder with randos for 30 additional minutes to make the following one. A ten minute cushion wasn’t nearly enough.

Key takeaways: As a solo male, I never once felt in danger, and never once had someone try to grab my bag. There aren’t enough bathrooms, and when you find one, many will charge you a euro to use them - even inside places like train stations. Keep some euros on you for this, it’s hell trying to find relief otherwise. Be prepared for things not to work: ticket machines, elevators, escalators, doors. I also learned that using a taxi was similar in price to rideshare services like Bolt, and often shaved off as much as 40 minutes of a commute if it involved switching buses or transferring from metro to bus/trolley etc.

Is Spanish/Portuguese necessary? If you go 15 minutes outside of touristy areas it is not uncommon to encounter people with little English and in many cases zero English. I was thankful to have some Spanish, and I really really felt that locals appreciated my attempts to use it. If you go off the beaten path at all like I did, language will absolutely be a barrier, but you don’t need to be fluent at all to get by. It’s generally not a problem in the airport, train stations, shops, and restaurants near hotels/city centers. 

Long read, but happy to answer any questions someone may have if they’re looking at a similar itinerary. Spain and Portugal are absolutely mind-blowing, and anyone lucky enough to go will certainly love their time there!

I didn't expect the harassment to be so bad - everyone wants a photo with the white person, all the time men come to me, starting to talk to me no matter if they speak English or not, everyone is staring, even the local police men harassed me on the street, even little boys asked to kiss me. Everyone is asking why I'm alone, they can't comprehend it and pity me. One local guide on a boat tour harassed me all the time, telling me he likes white people and wants to hug a white person. It's weird, it's creepy and it makes me feel uncomfortable. In general there are many friendly people and the nature is stunning, but I'm feeling like a zoo animal and I just want to be left alone. Fortunately I'll leave Sulawesi quite soon and I guess it will be better in the more touristy areas of Indonesia like Bali and Java. 

I have to say though that in the Christian north of Sulawesi it wasn't so bad and I had an amazing time leaning to Freedive there.

My Taipei plans are pretty solid, but I’m struggling to plan the rest of my trip.

Originally, I wanted to visit **Hualien** and **Taroko Gorge**, but it seems like Taroko is still closed, so I’m thinking it might not be worth it. I’ll need to be back in Taipei on the **7th of November (Thursday)** in the evening for my flight the next day (not booked yet), so I have **under a week** to explore other cities.

So far, I’m considering visiting **Tainan** and **Kaohsiung** from **November 2nd (Saturday)** onward, but I’d love to add **one more destination** in between. From what I’ve read:

* **Sun Moon Lake** and **Alishan** sound good but might be too far with my limited time and might not be the priority with the limited time. Although the bike ride in SML does look relaxing and scenic!
* Can't decide between **Yilan**, **Taitung**, and **Taichung** for that extra stop, but I can’t decide which one is worth visiting, given my time frame.

Any suggestions on how to structure the rest of my trip or which city to add would be super helpful! Also, if you think there’s a better route or city I haven’t considered, I’m open to ideas. Happy to scrap my whole plan except for the Taipei part at the start and redo lol!

- I want to stay flexible and not super committed to my plans , so I was thinking of just applying for Visas day before or day of travel. Will that be a problem? 

-  Should I replace any of these places? 

- Saudi or Oman for someone just walking around.

So, I’ve been staying at this hostel for a few days, and as most people who travel know, it’s pretty much hit or miss when it comes to meeting people. Well, this time, it was definitely a hit. From the moment we started talking, it felt like I’d known them for a long time. We went from casually chatting in the common area to sharing meals, exploring the city together, and having some deep convos late at night.

I’m usually a pretty laid-back person and take my time forming connections, but with these guys, it just clicked naturally. We had similar vibes, shared our travel stories, and got to know each other’s lives beyond just being travelers. It was one of those rare instances where it felt like you’re meeting more than just temporary friends, but people you really connect with.

But, like all good things, they had to move on to their next destination. And now, I’m feeling this strange sense of loss. I mean, I knew it was coming, people are always coming and going in hostels but I didn’t expect it to hit me this hard. It’s weird, isn’t it? How you can meet someone for such a short time and feel such a strong connection, then feel bummed out when they leave.

Anyone else ever experience this? How do you deal with the feeling of people moving on? 

Ps: I’m backpacking through southeast asia, and I have been doing it for only a month now. Does this feeling get easier with time? ",2024-09-22 14:21:31

I always do solo travel and one of the challenges I usually have, is that people thinks that because they travel with family they can step over you or you have less privileges or lets call it rights. For instance, in a flight, 3 family member came in and 2 of them sit with me and the father was in other random seat, so they asked me to change the seat. It happened to me many times, in one of situations I paid for the seat and they got mad at me. Incredible.
Another example, in a busy restaurant where you can see tables free, they denied me a table or place where eat something even going earlier before gets busy. In one of them they suggested me to take away. Hahaha wtf!!.
I understand full tables they make more money, but all I want to do is eat and go, it is easy work.

Hi everyone,

I’m a 43-year-old male who’s feeling like I’ve missed out on a lot of life. In my 20s, I was so caught up with work and responsibilities that I never had the chance to travel or really experience the world. Now that I’ve hit my 40s, I’m dealing with a lot of feelings—some depression, maybe a bit of a midlife crisis—and I’m looking to shake things up. 

I’ve saved up some PTO and want to take 10-14 days to travel solo, hoping to reconnect with myself and make some new memories. I’ve already been to Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Iceland, but now I’m drawn to the Baltics, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe. I’m craving adventure but also meaningful connections—whether that’s with other travelers or locals.

I’ve been looking into G Adventures and similar group tours, but I’m wondering if that’s the right path. Has anyone here had life-changing experiences through solo travel, especially when dealing with tough times like depression or feeling lost? Does a group tour like G Adventures help with making connections, or would you recommend hostels, meetups, or other ways to meet people while still maintaining a sense of independence?

I’d love to hear any advice or personal stories, especially if travel has helped you through challenging periods in life. I’m really hoping this trip can bring some perspective and help me feel more alive again.

Thanks for reading and for any insights you can share. It means a lot.",2024-09-22 11:38:30

Hi! 

I'm planning on travelling through Malaysia arriving at Kuala Lumpur at the 30th of September, and leaving on 17 October via Singapore (I know, different country). 

I'm primarily interested in visiting Malaysia, and was wondering whether (considering the weather and amount of travelling) it would be better to visit Taman Negara/Cameron Highlands (and possibly Perhentian Islands), or to travel to Sabah to do a Kinabatangan Tour and snorkel near Kota Kinabalu. Basically; visiting the peninsula or including Sabah in the trip. 

I would be interested in the nature and possibly some wildlife, but wouldn't say no to a single day at the beach for instance. 

Idea is to end my visit in Penang via either routes (mainland or a flight from Sabah) to be able to take a flight to Singapore for the final day. 
  
Anyone got any experience of travelling through Malaysia in October? And would recommend including either of Sabah or Taman Negara?

Thank you all for your kind words and your insight. It truly has meant the world to me during a tough few days. On the advice of the sub Reddit, I have decided to book a hotel in Florence tonight. I was not able to find a Hostel unfortunately but I’m planning on doing some tours to meet people hopefully. It will be a quicker train ride, I don’t think I’m up for hubbub of Rome at the moment. I’m not sure if I’m gonna cut my trip short or not, but I think being somewhere a little more restful might help me reset. Thank you. I hope this is the right move!!! 

Original post: Hello all! I’m an American woman traveling solo in Italy and I have to confess, I’m not having a good time and I’m considering going home early. I would appreciate any compassion or guidance you have to offer, but please save hold back on the unkindness. I really don’t need it today. I travel for work and have backpacked before so I’m surprised that I’m having such a challenging time.

I booked cheap flights from my home city to Marseille and then flew to Milan. I heard it was fashion week I got really excited to join in on the festivities! I know a lot of it is closed off, but I assumed the good energy, interest, and events would bring a lot of cool people together, whether or not I made it into any of the official shows. However, most of the people that I’ve met have been unkind and outright rude. I honestly feel like I am in third grade being talked down to by popular girls. It’s literally so weird.

I decided to take a day trip to Venice today given that Milan didn’t seem to be a good fit and I’m enjoying it but ended up up getting stranded here due to an issue with the train. It’s absolutely breathtaking here, but I can’t help but wish that I had someone to share it with. I miss my boyfriend and my cat back home so much and the idea of getting through another week and a half of travel just feels heartbreaking. 

I’ve waited my whole life to get to do a trip like this, but all I want is to go home. I’m so ashamed that I’m not having more fun and I don’t really know what I’m doing wrong. I’m hoping that the Hostel in Rome is a better vibe and that I can find some more relaxing things to do to decrease some of the mental stress. Any tips on turning my dream trip gone wrong around?",2024-09-21 19:04:32

I am opening to hearing any tips/suggestions/dos/don’t dos/suggestions to make my trip meet or surpass the Bucket-list experience expectations I have in my mind. lol 

So far here is my rough itinerary:

1) Spend 2 (maybe 3 days in Sydney; landing there on a Sunday morning)

            - Plan on staying in a Hostel close to the city center 
            - Seeing the Sydney Opera House
            - Making a 1/2 day or a full day trip the 2nd day to see The Blue Mountains/Three Sisters

2) Fly from Brisbane to Cairns on the morning of Day 3 or 4 of my trip and pick-up my Camper-van rental - stock up on Supplies and start my 7 - 8 day roadtrip to Cairns. I plan on staying at campgrounds along the coast (beaches and some inland) along the way doing most of my driving during the early morning. 

               - Visit The Australia Zoo (1/2 day)
               - Drive Through The Glass House.  Mountains 

 3) Drop off my camper-van rental the morning of the 7th or 8th day of my trip. Check into a nice hotel in Cairns and spend the rest of the day exploring Cairns/enjoying the scenery. 

4) Day 9 or Day 10 - Take a guided group trip to visit the Daintree Rainforest/Cape Tribulation. 

5) Morning of Day 10 or 11 - fly to Yulara Airport from Cairns and spend 2 maybe 3 days visiting Uluru. 
                 - Watch the sunrise over Uluru
                 - Guided tour around base of Uluru
                 - Visit The Olgas and hike The Valley      
                    of The Winds 
                 - Experience The Fields of Light/Sounds of Silence dinner and stargaze at night 

6) Day 13 or 14 - depart from Yulara airport back to Sydney in the morning (spend a few hours doing last minute sight-seeing before I fly back to the USA). 

Here are a few things I would love to do/see but I don’t think are feasible.

- [ ] Visit the town of Carinda (stay in the Carinda hotel, I’m a big David Bowie and he shot one of his 1980s’ music videos in the town of Carinda. There is a David Bowie music festival happening from October 4th - 6th 2024, but I won’t be in AUS by then).

- [ ] Take a surfing lesson (group or one on one) In Sydney or any locations on my drive up from Brisbane to Cairns; would like it to be a few hours-1/2 day). I have never been surfing before and I would love to.

- [ ] Do a guided group Snorkel or scuba-dive of part of the Great Barrier Reef (unsure of the risks, how unsafe it might be, etc). 

- [ ] Buy a fishing pole and tackle/bait and go fishing one of the mornings/evenings when I am camped out on a beach somewhere along the route from Brisbane to Cairns. (What are the rules/laws for foreigners to fish in Australia? Do foreigners need to buy a fishing license?)

- [ ] Visit Whitsundays and or Fraser Island (possible day trip, do not think I’ll have the time to do this, it’s low on my priority list of potential things to do anyways).

Since I'm already in South America I would love to visit Peru, but I'm having a hard time making the perfect, cost-efficient trip to Peru. this is my itinerary right now: 



Plan 1:

Day 1- Arrive at Cusco in the morning. Visit san pedro market, Plaza de armas, Corincancha. Sleep at some Airbnb

Day 2- go to Aguas Calientes with Peru or Inca Rail (that I buy online). Spend the day there visiting Manco Capac plaza, the big artisanal market, and natural hot springs. Then sleep in an Airbnb.

Day 3- go to Machu Picchu by bus (that you buy online too). After machu pichu go back to AC with the bus.  Eat and get on the train to Ollantaytambo ( I can't find any cheaper options than a train, please help me out). Arrive at Ollantaytambo and sleep at an Airbnb

Day 4- Go to the Ollantaytambo ruins. Then tour the sacred valley: Maras, Moray, Chincero, (Pisac?). But I have no idea how to do it because I don't want to be constrained by a tour guide on where and how long I can stay (plus it's very expensive) and I probably couldn't rent a taxi in Ollantaytambo, because I can't speak Spanish and they would charge me ridiculous prices. Then after the tour, I would end up in Cusco. Airbnb

Day 5- Go to the Rainbow Mountain (Vinicunca), don't know the best way to get there, tho. Get back to Cusco.

Day 6- take the flight back to SP

My second plan was to travel the Sacred Valley first and then go to AC, go to Machu Picchu, and take the Inca, PeruRail back to Cusco. Im planning this trip for November because MP is sold out until then. How is the weather in mid-November there usually? Please keep in mind I'm a Student so I'm trying to save money where I can.

I had a few questions about the route that I am taking, especially around Central Asia.

Proposed route:

London --> Istanbul --> Yerevan --> Tbilisi --> Baku --> Ashgabat -->Uzbekistan (Khiva, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Tashkent) --> Dushanbe (from Tashkent) --> Osh (via Pamir Highway) --> Bishkek --> Almaty (from here I would fly onwards to Tokyo / take the train to Astana).

I am planning to fly between London & Istanbul, Istanbul & Yerevan, and Baku & Ashgabat. The rest of the border crossings are via shared taxi, bus, train, etc.

A few questions:

Can I fly direct from Baku to Turkmenistan?

I plan to stay in Turkmenistan for around 5 days (to get the transit visa), I am wondering how much a guide would cost to bring me around Ashgabat, the gas craters, and Konye-Urgench (+ transfer to Uzbekistan / Khiva)? Possible to hire guides in Turkmenistan, or should it be booked online beforehand?

Is it easiest to take the train between cities in Uzbekistan and to get from Tashkent to Dushanbe, or is there a better way?

Lastly, how is the Pamir Highway from Dushanbe to Osh? Is the road quality good? Can you rent a car and take it at your own pace (one way from Dushanbe to Osh)? Or is it better to just get a taxi or bus?

Curious if the above listed is a frequent backpacking route- I only have 1-1.5 weeks, so I won’t accomplish all three of those countries, but I was thinking about checking out:

-San Blas Islands
-Bocas Del Toro
-Baru Volcano National Park 
-Playa Poyo
-Leon
-Ometepe Island 

As I LOVE hiking, waterfalls, zip lining, kayaking, (anything active and in nature truly). If anyone has already traveled to these destinations or has other insider tips just about safety and less “touristy” areas or hidden gems- very open to those!

I’ll be there in mid April, and am conversational in Spanish so I feel comfortable going into more rural areas additionally. ",2024-09-21 21:43:51

Eating alone in public has been hard though because I literally sit down and lose my appetite!  I think it’s probably the nerves playing a role in this, and I’ve definitely lost a few pounds.  I write this because tonight I got an air bnb to take a break from hostels and reset, (which is another story entirely), and I ate the whole plate of food.  It has to be the nerves, which I can handle.  It definitely takes me like 5-10 mins to mentally prepare before I go out to eat lol.

I’m (27M) considering a solo trip to Uzbekistan for a week in October and could use some advice. I've recently done a few solo trips to some other places which aren't really on the backpacker trail and found the lack of interaction with other travellers pretty isolating, which really took away my enjoyment of the trip.

Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to visit Central Asia but I imagined it to be the sort of place I'd want to do with company. However, the circumstances have randomly arisen where a trip to Uzbekistan would be feasible for me to go alone. Due to life circumstances, I think it's unlikely I'd have the opportunity to visit in the near future.

The plan would be to visit Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara, and I’d love to include Khiva, but it seems difficult to fit it into my schedule. What’s the backpacking scene like in these cities? Am I likely to meet other travellers or locals, or is it going to be quite a lonely trip?

Also, I prefer not to prebook accommodation or transport since I often extend my stay in places spontaneously. I’ve heard that train tickets can sell out quickly—how challenging is it to navigate transportation and accomodation without prior arrangements?

Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: thanks everyone for your advice!! I’ve taken a look at the train options for my dates and I don’t think it’s going to work out. There are still trains available (that aren’t Afrosiyob) but they all arrive either very early or very late. Due to some unpleasant experiences I promised myself I wouldn’t put myself in similar situations again. I also have zero knowledge of Uzbek or Russian. I feel like I’ll probably regret this decision but I guess I also need to be realistic and respect my own limitations and past experiences. I hope will I get the opportunity to visit Uzbekistan at some point in my life.",2024-09-21 10:37:18

Fear of (deathly) accidents because of a Dutch tv programme,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fmuuup/tips_for_the_anxious_solo_traveler_fear_of/,41,"Hi everyone! I am 23, Dutch, and quit my job to travel to New Zealand soon. My plan is to buy a van and through travel New Zealand! I am looking forward to it a lot and can’t wait to get there. However, with my departure date nearing, anxiety increases.

In the Netherlands we have this program on tv which is called “Break Free”. It is about young travellers who died during their travels. Their family and friends will finish the trip that the person who died wanted to make. It is so sad because they are all people who wanted to see the world just like you and me, but who died during their trip. 

Last episode was about a guy who died in New Zealand… he fell out of a the back of a pick up truck just before he wanted to go back home to the Netherlands. It was an accident. All episodes are about “accidents”. One girl died in south-east Asia because of carbon monoxide intoxication in a hotel. Another one died in a car accident in South America.

This is not the tv show I wanted to see be for my solo trip to the other end of the world.  I know the basic solo traveller tips on how to stay safe. But you cannot prepare for everything I guess (I now know that I should not sit in the back of a pickup truck), but there a thousands of things that can go wrong.

I know that a lot of people are very alive after decades of traveling. But it makes me think a lot about safety and solo travel. What do you think? And do you have any advice for this anxious solo traveler?",2024-09-22 14:41:46
solotravel,1fm0or8,Solo travel 24F - best way to travel Europe 8-9 months?,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fm0or8/solo_travel_24f_best_way_to_travel_europe_89/,32,"I’m a 24-year-old Australian female graduate looking to start travelling from the start of April 2025 until December 2025/January 2026. I’m open to leaving Aus from as early as February 2025, though! I’ll likely primarily be staying in/around UK/Europe. Nothing at all is locked in, so I really want to hear what people have done over a period of 8-9 months of travel / suggestions for how to fill this time so I can get a better idea of the best way to spend this time. I want to start off with a bang!

I want a mixture of slow travel and fast travel (sightseeing in a few countries that aren’t worth staying in for longer than a week). I’m also thinking about doing fast travel for the first few months to see as much as possible (even open to doing a Contiki to start it off and meet people), then renting a place in the UK or Italy (I speak Italian) for the latter few months (or elsewhere, open to suggestions) and travelling on weekends around Europe. Also open to working in hostels or on farm stays.

I’d love to see any itineraries or hear any ideas that people have to fill up my time to make it worthwhile! It’ll likely change as I go, but I do want a rough idea on places that I’d like to see / how best to split my time.

My interests are history, nature and also want to try out a meditative retreat.

Top priorities are safety and affordability.

I have the option to work remotely (in the legal profession, which is what I’ll be returning to work in), with flexible hours and opt-in work. I’m considering this given it’s $50 an hour and the work is relatively do-able, so it’d fund the trip nicely. However, I’m concerned because:

1. I start working full time in the legal profession on my return as a graduate so I’m travelling to make the most of my time away from law as I’ve worked in law for 3 years and studied for 6 years.
2. I want to get the full experience while travelling and don’t want deadlines hanging over me if I can’t get work done because of internet connectivity issues, etc. and it would be nice to work a job overseas that doesn’t require too much brainpower for my gap year. I feel like I’d meet more people this way, too.
3. It might be hard to get work done if I plan on staying in hostels (at least while I’m fast travelling for the first few months)

I've got a loose budget of $20,000 for the whole trip but obviously will be working either remotely or looking to get a working holiday visa in a country I plan on staying in for a few months at least.

I don't see how this would help me though. I have no interest in traveling anywhere in the US besides Alaska, Miami, and some border towns in the US but I really have no interest in going now. Maybe going somewhere once because then I'd figure out what things I need that I forgot the first time but they think I would spend a year traveling.

They also think it's a bad idea because they wouldn't be able to help me as easily if something happened as if I were in the US. I also get the impression that they think every corner of LatAm is dangerous and while it's usually more dangerous than where I live it's very possible to spend time there safely if you research where you go beforehand.",2024-09-21 07:14:29

I quit my job to go travelling for 3-6 months. I have been in Indonesia for 3 weeks, I started from Jakarta and have been heading East, currently in Bali. The past couple days I have been feeling an overwhelming urge to pack it in and go home once I have seen the rest of what I want to see in Indonesia (in around 3-4 weeks). I had originally planned to check out Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam after.

I have been doing tons of activities where I can: getting scuba diving instructed, rock climbing, 4 mountain hikes, but I’ve also had chill days where I do nothing but sit in a hammock, read and reflect. I’ve met tons of cool people whom I message frequently to check what they’re up to, some became good friends that led to bittersweet goodbyes. 

I have and am having a blast but I feel as though I am/have hit my limit. If I were to catch a flight home tomorrow I would be satisfied with what I’ve done. I miss the routine of home, and I feel motivated to get back into my career with a fresh mindset (leaving my last role was overdue).

I am planning to continue and review how I’m feeling in a week’s time incase I’m in the blues, but if I still feel the same I will think about booking my flight home. 

I feel shame and lameness in the fact that I might cut my trip short. Friends and family back home say “you won’t get a chance like this again”, “you quit your job for this”. 

But what’s the point in forcing it if my hearts not in it anymore? And sure I’ll go travelling again, why not? I have plenty of money and I’m a skilled software programmer, I can do it again if I want

Edit 2: Update 3 days after posting this for anyone who’s interested or has found this thread in a similar position to me: I am still feeling very ready to go home but I decided to book a spontaneous flight to Krabi in Thailand to check out the rockclimbing for 5 days or so! My plan is to check out Bangkok for a day or so afterwards and then I’ll head home, but that may change! The best advice I got out of this thread and my own reflection is to follow your heart and do whatever makes you happy. Don’t panic, give yourself a few days to chill and decide what’s best for you.

I'll be arriving in Barcelona on the 14th and need to leave for Paris on the morning of the 19th. I'm torn between three options: 

1. Leaving Barcelona on the 16th to spend 2.5 to 3 days in Madrid.  
2. Leaving earlier and spending 4 days in Madrid.  
3. Staying in Barcelona the entire time and skipping Madrid altogether with hopes to visit it some other day.

I'm a solo traveler, and I don't drink alcohol or enjoy nightlife. I am active and I'm more interested in visiting attractions and exploring the culture. 

From what I've researched I think I’ve planned to visit the Sagrada Familia, Park Güell, and the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. In Madrid, I'm interested in a day trip to Toledo, as well as visiting the Royal Palace, Reina Sofia Museum, Retiro Park etc.
Attractions like those go along my likes

Budget isn’t a concern for either, they'll both cost almost the same. And I'll be staying in a hostel either way. My focus is on making the most of my time.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I guess i overestimated my ability to meet people/other solo travelers at like bars and such (on the islands I was on, this wasn’t really a thing, at least that I found).

I’ve rearranged the last few nights of my trip so I will be staying in hostels, so I’ll get a chance to socialize. 

However, in terms of the trip so far I guess I’m kind of kicking myself and curious to hear from others — what are some travel regrets you’ve had/decisions you’ve made where in hindsight you were like “I would’ve done things differently if I could have a do-over”?

I'm coming to Reddit as usual for advice on my summer itinerary. I am getting ready to start planning this trip and think about what people think especially about general advice and if I am correct on all my modes of transportation here.

I was in Europe last summer and have seen almost all of it, but I am just in love with Southeast Asia and all these places (except the 3 nights I spent in Bankgok are new). I did a one-month Vietnam motorbike trip and had the time of my life. I am an experienced rider, but as an American, the opposite side of the road thing does scare me in addition to Thailand's reputation. I wouldn't say I found Vietnam easy, but compared to Boston it probably was!

I may even begin soon looking for jobs in Southeast Asia so want to explore the area more.

The main questions are:  
**-Do modes of transportation seem right? How much of this should I book in advance minus the main flights of course**  
**-Same as above for hotel booking in advance. I rolled into Vietnam and never needed to book far in advance for good prices, wondering if that's the case. Except for my starter hotel in Singapore.**

**-I found hostel living made me feel ""old"" in Europe last time at 36 haha, any advice to meet people or is this less of a problem in Asia? I did hotels mostly in Vietnam, but love to meet people which is why I travel alone. I am not well off but am doing ok that I can afford a little more luxury.**

**-The pace seems fast probably to most, but this is 1 day less than what I had for each city in Vietnam and I felt I had more than enough time. I was on the bike which was flexible, however.**

I feel very guilty, but I came in so burnt out of travel before this trip. I had spent 1.5 months abroad, and 3 weeks later BAM another trip. It's been hard falling in love with this country. It's beautiful, but between obscene sweating, early excursion times, and extreme altitude sickness, I decided to leave early.

It's been rough. Since the moment I flew in, I felt like I wanted to go back. I have pushed through half of it. Then I started the portion of my trip with high altitudes (3000m+) and my trip was only supposed to continue upwards, and it felt like my body was on fire. I know a person can acclimate, but I was born in a flat place and have lived in a flat place my entire life and I severely underestimated my capabilities. I don't want to faint on trail with a guide, but I also don't want to meander and do nothing in these cities but feel sick for the next 12 days. So I changed my ticket home to today.

I feel guilty. I feel like I've failed. But at the same time I'm so relieved. I've definitely learned a lesson about these high altitude countries: not good for me to solo travel to. One day I'll return and see what's left, but with another person.

I'm so excited to go home and pet my cats. I think unfortunately it's just a failed trip, but I've learned something. 

Have any of you left trips early? How do you cope with the guilt? Why do I feel like someone is mad at me when everyone around me understands when I told them about my decision and supports me?",2024-09-20 06:40:10

1. what would be a good home base for getting to the Magdalene sites and then exploring the surrounding areas? preferably without renting/hiring a car. i would like to sleep in one spot for as long as possible, and am interested in nature/being by the ocean, if possible.

I’m a 25M traveling solo to **Vienna** from October 26 to November 1, while also planning a day trip to **Bratislava**. This is my first time in both cities, and I’d love to get your opinions on my itinerary and any recommendations or changes you think could make the trip better.

Here’s what I’ve got planned so far:

**26 Oct (Arrival day)**:

* Arriving in Vienna at 21:45, so nothing much.
* Check in to my hostel, then sleep well.

**27 Oct (Schönbrunn & Prater)**:

* Morning: **Schönbrunn Palace** and Gardens (w/ Classic Pass).
* Lunch around Schönbrunn.
* Evening: Visit **Prater** and ride the **Riesenrad**.
* Dinner at **Schweizerhaus** in Prater.
* Head back to the hostel, relax, and sleep.

**28 Oct (Museums & Opera)**:

* Breakfast at **Carl Ludwig Café**.
* Morning: **Belvedere Palace** (Superior).
* Lunch at **Bitzinger Würstelstand**.
* Afternoon: **Albertina Museum**.
* Evening: **Vienna State Opera** to see **La Bohème**.
* Back to the hostel for the night.

**29 Oct (Day trip to Bratislava)**:

* Morning: **Boat to Bratislava**. Explore **Old Town** and visit **Bratislava Castle**.
* Return to Vienna by train in the late afternoon.
* Evening: Maybe find a relaxing **café or biergarten** in Vienna, depending on time and weather.

**30 Oct (Sightseeing & Parliament tour)**:

* Breakfast at **Café Pruckel**.
* Morning: Visit **St. Stephen’s Cathedral** (tour and catacombs, *is tower worth it?*).
* Lunch at **Pfudl** (planning to try their Veal Schnitzel).
* Afternoon: **Parliament** guided free tour. Walk by the **Rathaus**.
* Evening: Open to suggestions – maybe some small bar like **Tür 7** or **Krypt**?

**31 Oct (Heuriger & Kahlenberg)**:

* Morning: Explore **Setagaya Park** and **Karl-Marx-Hof**.
* Afternoon: Visit a **Heuriger** in **Nussdorf**. Need suggestions, not too expensive,
* Sunset: Hike up to **Kahlenberg** or **Leopoldsberg** for some panoramic views.
* Evening: Relax, head back to the hostel.

**01 Nov (Last day)**:

* Morning: I'm not clear on what to do, considering it’s All Saints' Day, and I've got little time, I'm torn between a visit to the **Hofburg & Sisi Museum** or the **Zentralfriedhof**.
* 12:15: Head to the airport for my 14:50 flight back.



**Thoughts on my itinerary?** Does it seem well-paced for solo travel? Is it too much? I’m trying to balance museums, sightseeing, and downtime to enjoy the local culture.

**Any must-visit places I'm leaving out or hidden gems** I should check out near Schönbrunn, the Prater, or during my free evenings?

**Heuriger advice**: I’m planning to visit one in Nussdorf on Oct 31. Any favorites?

**Evening suggestions for 30 Oct**: After my Parliament visit, I’m looking for a cozy place to grab a drink and relax. Any favorite **bars** in the city center?

Thanks so much in advance! I’m really excited for this trip, and any tips or advice you have would be appreciated!",2024-09-20 05:57:01

For context, I don't drive, so it's only by public transport and I avoid flights as much as possible. 

I'd appreciate any advice on solo-travelling here - I've never solo travelled outside of Schengen before. I have been to the Middle East twice so it's not entirely unfamiliar to me, but any tips are appreciated. I also don't know anything really about Georgia or Armenia, so any advice on those two would be great! Is there a hostel culture there? I get lonely quite easily while solo travelling so I want to find people to chat to on occasion.

My options are either to have a month there (in addition to however long I spend there on my way back, I've not gotten that far yet), or about 2 weeks. Any recommendations of where to see will be great. I like coastal places but more for the views rather than a beach-swimming type trip - so the southern coast as well as the Black Sea coast really intrigue me.

solotravel,1flpj61,"Manchester, England nightlife rant ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1flpj61/manchester_england_nightlife_rant/,16,"So just to start off, I've only been solo traveling for two weeks now and loved every moment. I plan on going for a total of 4 months in Europe, and 4 in Asia, or until I run out of money. But this is kind of a negative experience. Not a bad one, but not good. Just need to rant lol

The past few hostels have been great in terms on nightlife. They've offered bar crawls and/or social activities which helps cuz during the day I'll usually do stuff on my own and then that will give me a chance to socialize. Now I'm usually an introvert, but knowing other single people or a couple of friends that are traveling alone helps me socialize, plus it's always a good ice breaker. 

I booked a hostel in Manchester cuz I'm a football fan, and the city has been wonderful to see. But the hostel I'm at doesn't provide any social activity nor bar crawl and it's right on the street. So I thought to myself, whatever, I'll just go by myself. I personally just can't go to a bar and start talking to a stranger, I'm not at that level yet lol. But if there's a dance floor I can let loose and just focus on the music and dance and hopefully talk to people (like a peacock showing it's feathers lol)

Buuuuuuutttt I was literally turned away from 4 bars.... 1 one them which I didn't have a ticket for and they sold out, so fair. But the other three I was turned away because I was alone. I guess most of the establishments have a rule of no single parties??? Which I don't really get but it just kinda ruined the city for me. Like I'm here by myself and I'm tryna get out of my comfort zone, yet they don't let me. Idk Manchester is a very cool city, a lot of young people too, but I guess not that great for nightlife if you are alone, or if you're at a hostel that doesn't provide any sort of social activity. 

This isn't obviously going to deter me away, like I said before I just needed to rant. But is it like this anywhere else??

For context I'm 20M, I do enjoy good partying/nightlife but it is far from priority. Good nature/culture/beaches/history all matter to me as well. I tend to keep an extremely loose itinerary and just go with the flow. Here are the options I'm considering and why:

Option 1: Banana Pancake Trail. Hits diverse parts of Thailand and includes Laos, and there would be plenty of other travelers there. However, I'd rather do the trail in around 8-12 weeks time and not be rushed.

Option 2: Fly into Hanoi, Vietnam and start traveling south down the coastline before beginning NW into Cambodia and Bangkok, Thailand. Then travel south to the Thai/Malay peninsula eventually into Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, sort of making a backward ""S."" My trip would either end there or I would continue down to Singapore and fly home from there (depends on time). If this is the path I end up taking I will likely spend the majority of the time in Vietnam and Thailand (at least 1.5 weeks in each) and spread the remaining 2 or so weeks in between. This path hits pretty much everything I feel passionate about seeing but does not include Laos or northern Thailand, but I plan on returning to SEA within the next few years anyway, so I can live with not going right now. 

I'm very open to suggestions and I'd love to hear about some places I should visit while in the area. Some of the things I definitely want to see are: Ha Long bay (Vietnam), Son Doong Cave (Vietnam), Mekong River delta (Vietnam), Phnom Penh & Bayon Temple (Cambodia), Bangkok & Phuket (Thailand).",2024-09-19 20:32:16

I am embarking on my second solo travel to Europe this November. Last year I visited Iceland, London, and Paris and want to do something similar this year. 

So far, I know I want to go back to Iceland for Iceland Airwaves (which is from November 7-9). I don't know if I want to travel there a few days before, so I can visit an ice cave or ride a horse. 

My next big destination will be Switzerland. I think I want to do a week in the country. I will probably start in Zurich for a couple days and then venture out to different places staying in multiple hostels. Do you think that is the best idea? I think initially I was going to stay in Zurich and do day trips each day and then go back to one of the hostels in Zurich each night. But, I think that would be too much and more wiser to stay in multiple hostels. 

I was going to go straight from Iceland to Switzerland. But.. the distance is a bit too much and the flights aren't direct with long layovers. So... I am going to pick a country to visit in between such as Denmark (Copenhagen) or Germany and then take a train to Zurich. 

Maybe I will do Iceland a couple days before the festival (arrive in Iceland on November 4th or 5th and leave on the 11th). Then go to Denmark for three days. The only thing is my friend might join me on one of the weekends I am in Switzerland. 

I told him either the 15-18th or the 22-25th of November. I am indecisive if I want to end the switzerland trip with him or start the trip with him and then continue switzerland by myself. He told me to just give him the exact dates. Is a week in Switzerland a good timeframe to spend there? Or will I feel like it is too much? 

Sorry for the long post. I am just thinking outloud here. Any and all feedback would be highly and greatly appreciated! :D ",2024-09-19 16:46:47

I like to plan flights and stays very early, and for now this seems like the most suitable way to do it. Estimate budget for each part of the trip in included (rounded up a bit higher than what it probably would be):

Day 1-2: Flight Barcelona - Seoul (around 900€ round trip)

Days 2-8: 6 nights in Seoul (50€/night). Visiting the main landmarks, probably a couple of day trips, like Bukhansan (any other recommendations? Is the DMZ worth a day?)

Day 8: Flight Seoul - Jeju (50€ approx.)

Days 8-12: 4 nights in Jeju (70€/night). Visiting around the island. I've seen many things around the place and I feel like 4 night may not be enough, but I'm not sure I can make it any longer.

Day 12: Flight Jeju - Busan (70€ approx.)

Days 12-15: 3 nights in Busan (50€/night). Visiting in Busan (recommendations?)

Day 15: Train Busan - Seoul (75€ approx. on bullet train, may opt for a cheaper one)

Day 15-16: Final night in Seoul

Day 16: Flight back home

My main concern is that the time in Seoul may not be enough. I feel like there's so much to see and do in and around the city, so I'd like to know about your experiences. As for Jeju, as I said, I feel like it's also short, but I'd rather prioritise Seoul. Worth noting too that I'm a fast traveller by nature, even if I try not to.

Based on previous trips and what I read regarding the cost of being there, I estimated a 70€ daily expense while being there, which brings the total cost of the trip to 3015€. Is this accurate or am I too way off? As I said, I rounded up the prices a bit higher than what I found as I'd rather be overestimating the cost than underestimating it. The accomodation costs are estimated after a rather quick search on the Internet. I found private rooms with my own bathroom (kind of essential for me) at decent, well-reviewed guesthouses. Time of year is considered on the budgeting.

Is this realistic? Are more days in Seoul essential for you? Is there something I have not considered on the budget? Tips and suggestions are well appreciated.

  
ETA: Final night in Seoul is also kind of non-changeable as I do not want to start the day I catch an international flight on the other side of the country.",2024-09-19 15:23:23

I’d like to do an “easy-moderate hike” starting early.

Obviously the gveleti waterfalls is the safe choice but what is the most beautiful choice? Juta or truso? Also which one could be completed faster?

Based on my reaserch, the juta valley hike is shorter and has better views. i realise the views are subjective but for those of you who have been what do you think?

So, can you shed some light into this? How should I go about getting my e-visa?

Lesotho has no consular representation in Brazil, so if its not possible to get a visa online, I can try in South Africa. Before Lesotho, I will be in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces.

I have been hiking and camping so I had a lot of random bites already, and haven’t noticed any new ones recently. 

Either way, I was so freaked out that I moved rooms again and left all my stuff with reception. They washed and dried all of my clothes and fumigated my backpack. Everything I own is in plastic bags, with a separate one for things I couldn’t dry (like passport, wallet, electronics, shoes, etc). 

I checked into a new hostel and saw blood stains on one of the bed sheets and freaked out. I had reception help me check the mattresses of the other beds in the room and found zero other blood stains or any other signs of bugs.

I have been paranoid about them for the entire month I’ve been traveling, and finding one the other day has made it exponentially worse.

I’ve posted this in r/solotravel but I feel it could be relevant here too.

Just wanting to seek advice and to clear my head up a bit.

I’m a 30M from Australia who just broke up with my girlfriend living in Switzerland. We’d been together for about 9 months.

We met on a trip in Vietnam when I joined a G-Adventure and then during those 9 months we went to Korea and also travelled Europe together.

In my head, I fear I have associated the joy of travel with her and I feel as if I need to change that. For example, when I think about train rides I think about her being next to me sitting on the window seat or simply the joys of sharing a new meal together.

When I went to Vietnam alone, I was so confident and happy in my own head and now I can’t think of anything worse than to travel alone without companions. My friends are all fathers and mothers or simply do not want to travel.

My workplace closes for about one month at the end of the year and I really would like to travel over this period abroad, but I don’t want to travel completely alone.

I’m thinking about booking a 3-4 week long tour with a company to meet people and form new connections. I know tours are not the best for travelling as they rush through things, but I love the humans you can meet on the buses and train rides.

Has anyone been in this situation before? What did you do?

I feel as if I have lost so much confidence in myself since my initial trip to Vietnam which I ironically took due to a breakup. ",2024-09-17 21:57:50

On the penultimate day of my biking trip, I had already covered nearly 800 kilometers, and by this point, I had developed a decent level of expertise in riding motorcycles. From navigating through muddy paths, rough terrain at thousands of feet, to riding through snow and rain, I had experienced it all. Each challenge had taught me something new.

This particular day was special. I was riding solo from Leh to Kargil—a route that snakes through vast valleys, flanked by towering mountains. It was around 4 pm, with the sun beginning to set, casting a soft golden hue on the surrounding peaks. The harshness of the day’s sunlight had softened, and the gentle light was reflecting beautifully off the rugged landscape. The road was empty, with greenery stretching as far as the eye could see. It felt as if the bike was moving effortlessly beneath me, requiring no real effort to control.

The joy I felt in that moment was unmatched. It felt almost surreal, like I had stepped into a scene from a video game, with the scenery passing by in peaceful, perfect harmony. It was, without doubt, the only stretch of my trip where I didn’t record any videos—yet, the memory remains as vivid as if it had happened yesterday. It was a stretch of about 80 kilometers, but every moment of it was pure bliss.

Yesterday I (23M) came back from my first solo trip and it went actually good. So I'm not a noob at traveling, I actually have visited some places, but always with my parents. And now I was alone and I had to plan everything myself.   
  
On day 1, after waking up at 3 AM to get to the airport, I flew to Berlin and got a train to Potsdam. The gardens and palaces were amazing, definetly worth a visit if you're going like 5 days to Berlin (I only stayed two and a half, that's why I went straight to Potsdam). After walking all day I got back to Berlin, and with my phone at 2%, I found my hostel. I never stayed in one so I didn't know what to expect. My room was surpisingly quiet, but I could make conversation with a nice girl from Chile. I deeply thanked that she talked first because I'm quite shy with new people. Actually the main reason I wanted to stay in a hostel. I heard there was karaoke later at night, but I literally fell asleep at 9:30... And there goes day 1.

The next morning, the girl I talked yesterday and I, had breakfast. After saying goodbye to each other with a hug, I went to do a free tour in Berlin. Since the tour was, like, offered by another hostel, all the people that were signed up were rather young. During the tour (when the guide wasn't talking of course) everyone just chatted with each other like it was easy or they already knew each other, but hell, it was easy. I hadn't noticed and I was part of the conversation now. We talked and laughed, it was a cool group. Even after the tour, four of us stayed together to go to another place. That was the reason I wanted to go solotraveler. To experience something like that.

In the afternoon I got a train to Dresden and I slept there, to explore the city in the morning. It was very pretty and with a lot of history too. Then I got a direct bus to Wroclaw. When I arrived, since it was saturday, I thought to going out somewhere... But since the apartment had netflix and it was raining a bit, I just spent the night watching mean girls. The last day I explored the city, which was very pretty too, and then I got to the airport and went back home :D.",2024-09-16 17:03:10

solotravel,1fiqwii,Volunteering in London Hostel for 3 months and working: advice?,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fiqwii/volunteering_in_london_hostel_for_3_months_and/,10,"Hello everyone! First time posting so sorry if this doesn't belong here. Making a major life shift soon and could use your advice:   
Context: 

I'm (m29) a UK  citizen (born there but haven't been since I was 2 years old) who lives in Canada (permanent resident) and I recently had an opportunity for work to support me in doing my Masters in Denmark. It was actually my boss' idea and he offered financial support to do that (basically helping to cover a semester each year). For context I work as a consultant in the 'deliberative democracy' space. Unfortunately, there was a snag on when he paid the first semester of tuition (the wire transfer was late), and after having my offer cancelled and a lot of conversation with administration, I'll be starting a similar program at the same school in January (as opposed to September). 

The issue is, the school notified me essentially 3 weeks before I was about to leave, so I already had my apartment in Toronto sublet to a friend (who was moving across the country for it) and had already given my job my last day. So not wanting to stay in Canada and wallow, I figured I'd have a bit of an adventure and visit my home country of the UK to live and work there for the fall before I head to Denmark especially since the pound seems to be strong compared to other currencies right now. 

London Situation: 

My plan for London was to volunteer at an LHA London hostel (which would provide accommodation and food for 20 hours of work) while working part-time at a restaurant and doing some freelance work in my field. The freelance work can pay well but it will be very ad-hoc and I don't want to count it in my budget. 

I have around $7000 CAD in the bank, but $6000 of that is reserved for tuition, so it's more of an emergency buffer than savings. I have Canadian government student loans but those won't hit till January. 

So getting down to it, a couple of questions all things considered: 

* Does anyone have any experience volunteering and living in an LHA hostel? I've heard that you'd likely be in a room with 3-4 people. I'd prefer a bit of privacy (I don't mind one other person) mainly because I'll have my suitcase with all of my clothes to bring to Denmark with me. If I'm working in the city, is it worth it to just pay for a room in the hostel? 
* I plan on treating this as a working trip and living relatively frugally (not going out to restaurants etc), and I'm hoping to be able to save up around 2000 pounds by January. I'm assuming I'm making the UK minimum wage in this scenario. Does anyone with working experience in London think that's possible? I'm thinking of working at a gay restaurant ( I've read these are the only places you can expect to get some kind of tips in London + I'm gay). 
* Any other advice you'd give in this situation? 

Thanks for reading through all of this and appreciate any words of wisdom/experience you might have. 

  
TLDR: A UK citizen living in Canada wants to go and live in the UK for three months to work. Is It worth it to volunteer at the hostel to save on food and rent, or would I be able to make enough working full-time while having a small buffer so I don't starve?

solotravel,1fhydng,Solo travel (24F) after breakup,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fhydng/solo_travel_24f_after_breakup/,53,"Hi, I need some encouragement. I bought flight tickets to Mallorca when I was in better mood yesterday. I wanted to stay there for one week to do GR221 and some swimming, climbing, sightseeing. Yesterday I felt like I'm missing something, staying at home, sad and waiting for the school to start in October. I wanted some adventure because I couldn't do a lot of travel plans this summer because of the breakup and because of weeks leading to the breakup (we had plans together which were cancelled).

It's 8 days since we finally broke up. He dumped me and I still miss him so much. We are in contact a bit, sometimes write each other. We were together just a year but he is so big part of my life and I would love to share this trip with him if we didn't break up.
How I said yesterday I was quite confident and felt better so I decided to go. But today I feel horrible. The trip starts in two days and today I woke up and feel really bad about that decision. I regret paying the money for it and I am scared I won't be able to enjoy it. My biggest fear is that the trip will be terrible and I will just wait for the flight back sad and angry at myself. 

I have already done one solo trip few years ago (Camino Primitivo to Santiago) and I was just amazing. But I have never slept alone in the nature without tent, just under the stars. So I am scared also of this - that someone kill me for example during sleep or steal my things. I am mostly scared of men because of me being there alone... Or I am scared I hurt my knee (I have problems with ACL) and no one will help me... I hate how I just started to ovethink it all. :D Is it normal to feel like that before solo trip? I think normally I am really adventurous person with many hobbies but these days I am so anxious about everything so I ask myself - why am I doing this to myself? Wouldn't it be better to heal at home? 
Sorry, I just wanted to share my thoughts because no one knows I am going there yet. I am not sure if I did good decision. Do you have any encouragement for me? Have you also travelled soon after breakup and how was it? 

Thank you (and be nice to me please I feel like crying about everything now :D). ",2024-09-16 06:57:40
solotravel,1fif1iv,Trip report: First solo trip to the Netherlands (Amsterdam and Deventer),3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fif1iv/trip_report_first_solo_trip_to_the_netherlands/,3,"***Background / About Me***

I'm 29F from Norway, and have never been too interested in travel. I hadn't been abroad in a long time, and I originally only went now because my all time favourite band announced an Europe tour for the first time since I started listening to them 10 years ago. So I knew that I needed to make that happen, and I chose Amsterdam from the available tour dates mostly because it's easy to get to. Then it gradually evolved from thinking that I just wanted to fly in and out for the concert, to deciding to make a proper holiday of it. I was not comfortable with the idea of solo travel at all and my body was telling me in all sorts of ways the week before I was leaving that it thought this was a terrible idea, but I ended up having an amazing time and I'm so glad I went!

***Destinations, Trip Length and Considerations***

* **4 nights**, direct flights both ways from home to Amsterdam. Train to and from Deventer.
* **3 nights in Amsterdam**, because that's where my concert was.
* **1 night in** **Deventer** because I don't really enjoy big cities that much and wanted to get out of Amsterdam for a day. I went down a rabbit hole looking for places to go and Deventer seemed like the perfect choice for me (which I think it was!)
* **I bought the iAmsterdam card** mainly because I wanted the freedom to pop briefly into museums and taking public transport as much as I wanted. That freedom was great and I'm personally glad I did. 
* **I** **did not do stuff that required a time slot** because I did not want to feel that I *had* to do anything, which of course meant skipping all the big museums. I was fine with that because I have technically been there before, and there was lots of other things I wanted to do.

***Accomodation***

* Amsterdam: Female-only dorm at **Stayokay Vondelpark**. This was great! If you are the kind of traveller who want to meet people to explore with and hang out with there are probably better options, because I didn't get the sense of that happening a lot. But if you are more like me and want to do your own thing while maybe having small chats with roommates or at dinner, I would consider this place. Everything was clean and professional, the staff were really nice, food was simple but definitely good, and I felt safe at all times. Also, every night by 10 o'clock the lights were off in my room and everyone were quiet in their bed.
* Deventer: Single room at **Hostel Deventer.** This was basic but good, so everything I needed for a single night. There was a shared kitchen which was great and I shared a bathroom with one other person. That was okay, but I didn't really like that there were no sink there so that I had to go back to my room to wash my hands.

***Getting around***

It took me way too long to realize how delightfully simple Dutch public transport is. Read up on **OVpay**, because a lot of public transport will let you pay by just beeping your card when you get on and when you get off as long as you have a contactless card that works for it. Knowing that would have made my first day a lot easier! Also **trains are great** - even though I was travelling halfway across the country there were trains I could take every half an hour. Navigating the station was also very intuitive when I had just done some basic research.

***Low Points and Things I Struggled With***

* I had only one real ""shit this is a really bad idea""-moment, and that was at my **hometown** **airport**. I had fumbled my way through every step while being massively stressed, and was sitting in a corner at my gate feeling really scared and low on confidence with only groups of people speaking Dutch around me. It got better when I just got on my plane, and I was surprised how quickly I felt at ease when I arrived!
* **Getting across busy streets in Amsterdam** was an issue the whole time. A couple of times when I also was tired/hungry/kind of lost, it felt almost impossible, and it really wore me out. I got better at it with time, but I never really got used to it.
* For some reason **ordering food** was really hard for me. I was planning to buy food while exploring some of the days, but I was too scared to manage it and ended up eating most meals at my hostel. I was thankful I had that opportunity.
* **Worrying way too much about things that were totally fine.** This trip has absolutely increased my confidence in my ability to handle things, but it took a lot of worrying to get there.

***High Points***

* **The concert.** It was everything I hoped it would be and so much more. I even met another person in my hostel room who were also going, and we ended up spending the whole evening together. That is the sort of thing I definitely did not think could happen to me.
* **The people**. Everyone was just so nice to me. The random man who (presumably) said the Dutch version of bless you when I sneezed going past him and the random woman who striked up conversation while we were waiting for the tram. Everyone I interacted with at the museums and hostels, and the tram employees who helped me out when I couldn't get my card to scan. And all the people who said good morning to me while walking around in Deventer and Zwolle. 
* **The Pianola Museum.** Seriously, if you have any interest in musical instruments or classical music you need to come here while in Amsterdam. There are some places that feels just like stepping into a time capsule, and this was one of them. And the people there were absolutely wonderful.
* Using a giant rhubarb at **Hortus Botanicus** as a natural umbrella while having a grey heron walk right up to me. Also just wandering around there geeking out about all the cool plants.
* **Our Lord in the Attic** was also wonderful. This was not really on my radar but I kept seeing it recommended and will now join in on doing so!
* **Walking through the city eating fries on my last evening.** Both because they were easily the best fries I've had, and because it was this great feeling of ""getting"" the city in a way I hadn't before and managing two of the things I struggled with in Amsterdam :)
* Food shopping at the market in **Deventer.** Bergkwartier (where I ended up taking more pictures than the rest of the trip combined). Eating an early breakfast by a mirror-like IJssel river with mist on it, and then wandering at random through the city with hardly any people about. Honestly, just Deventer in general. I didn't really *do* much while there except wander around, but I could easily have spent three more days doing just that.

***Conclusion*** 

* **I felt safe at all times.** I also enjoyed solo travel a lot more than I thought I would!
* **I really, really liked the Netherlands,** and I very much want to go back some day. I felt mostly done with Amsterdam when I left, but I did not feel that I was done with Deventer. So I would love to use that (and possibly one or two other smaller cities) as bases to explore more of the country. 
* **I am very glad that I went, and doing this felt good on a deeply personal level.** I have a long history with anxiety, and this would have been unthinkable not that many years ago. Travelling by myself made me notice how far I've come, and it also made me realize that I can handle much more that I think I can. My anxiety was trying hard to tell me I couldn't do it, but at the same time my heart and my self worth was telling me that *yes, you are actually ready for this*. I'm really thankful and proud of myself for trusting them.

  
***A few tips (mostly) for fellow anxious travellers***

* I really, really dislike airports. If you do too, just know that there is not always a correlation between airport size and how stressful navigating them is. Going through my hometown airport was awful, and I was really worried about having to do Schiphol on my way back. But that was actually hardly stressful at all even though it has 12x more passengers, because everything is so efficient. In Norway every step had a long-ish line with one stressed employee at the end who therefore seemed annoyed with my fumbling and were eager to hurry me on. At Schiphol, each step had lots of employees who spoke calmly and told me exactly what to do and where to go.
* You almost always have more time than you feel you have. Anxiety is great at making you feel like everything is urgent, but that's often not true. Unless you really need to be somewhere at a specific time or are directly in harm's way, you have time and the city will wait for you. Find a bench to sit down at if the world is closing in on you. Your destination is also not going anywhere. You can come back. And people-watching at a bench is as much travelling as going to every museum and attraction there is.
* It's okay to fumble through interactions, I certainly did a lot of the time, and as long as you are nice and not obnoxious people will usually be nice in return. 
* It's okay to not face all your anxieties at the same time - be proud of the ones you *are* facing. 
* Specifically for Amsterdam: Stay off the bike paths. Like, seriously. I know this is the first tip anyone will give for the city and if you have done any research at all you've surely heard it. So had I, and still the first thing I did was almost being run over by a cyclist. The thing that got me was that having a green light for the street does not mean that bikes will stop for you. Unless you're from a place with similar bike culture, you are not prepared. Take your time with the streets until you get how it works.",2024-09-16 20:29:40

I (20'sF) have a week off in February, and I'm trying to figure out where to go. My friend was gonna come with me to do Machu Picchu, but she can't come anymore so I'm trying to decide if I still want to do that on my own, or wait till I have someone to join me, because it seems like a lot of steps to figure out (Flying to Lima, then to Cusco, then a train, need a tour guide? etc).

The other option I'm contemplating is a direct flight to Buenos Aires. I have no real plans of what to do in Buenos Aires other than chill, get a hotel with a pool, shop, eat, explore, etc. I was looking on the map and there's ferries that go to Montevideo, Uruguay, which I thought could also be an interesting way to spend a few days (do I need a full week in Buenos Aires or would I be bored?). However, I don't think there's direct flights from Montevideo back home so I'd have to take the ferry back to Buenos Aires to fly home. I don't know what I'd be doing there either except enjoying the vibes.

Things I like to do while traveling:  
-see cultural landmarks

-shop

-eat good food, sometimes cooking classes

-drink good coffee

-relax (it's summertime in south america, so hoping for a hotel with a pool)

-museums, art, shows, etc. 

not a big partier, although not opposed to a good drink somewhere cool and chatting with people

also trying to practice my spanish (i'm decent, but not totally fluent)

I left home on July 4th (I kind of love the symbolism of starting this journey on Independence Day), and have been really enjoying slow travel in places that were familiar to me, as well as some very foreign new places. 

But I don't have any plans after this month until November, and I'm starting trying to work out what I'm going to do. I'm literally getting a headache from trying to figure out all out!

It's great to have all the freedom to do whatever I want to do without compromising, but it's aggravating and exhausting to have to come up with all the ideas, and not have anyone to point out logistical problems or suggest alternatives that may end up being so much better.

Part of me just wants to start booking things and committing, just to get past the uncertainty and infinite possibilities - but then if I get a different idea tomorrow, will I regret being committed to these plans? And if I don't book these things now, will I lose the opportunity as availability dwindles, leaving me regretting my lack of conviction??

I have IBD and need to bring about 1,000 pills in total – mostly Mesalamine and some Prednisone (I’ll stop taking these by October, so just 100 pills of that). It’s all for personal use, and neither of the meds are narcotics. From what I’ve read, both are legal in Vietnam and Qatar for the layover, but the sheer quantity is stressing me out! (6 pretty big boxes of Mesalamine). How should i transport the medication best? 

Here’s what I’ve prepared:

* Printed prescription for the meds.
* A letter from my doctor detailing my condition and why I need these medications

This is my first time solo traveling, and I’m just worried about the meds being confiscated or getting into trouble at customs. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have tips on how to handle this at the airport? Anything else I should do to ensure it goes smoothly? Thanks so much!

I will be staying in an airbnb, hopefully the one I found that came to less than $600 CAD for the entire week is available when I can book (top rated, 5\* renter, retired, older woman, not concerned). 

My questions are: what are some budget friendly tourist options as well as must-do activities? I'm going to school for film production in my city this winter and aiming to get into UCLA for my masters in cinematography or directing/production. I'd love to tour the campus, but not sure if you can do that just anytime of the year.

I obviously LOVE film and television, so activities surrounding those things would be what I'd like to do. I also love true crime and know there are some cool crime museums and crime scene locations of course.

Any tips for a first time solo traveller to LA FROM people who live in LA or who have been numerous times would be amazing. I'm definitely thinking one of the bus tours and the crime museum (can't recall exactly what it's called) and possibly trying to get tickets to Jimmy Kimmel or Drew.

solotravel,1fg4ngb,"Trip Report from Burning Man, 2024",67,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fg4ngb/trip_report_from_burning_man_2024/,34,"**Journey**: 2 weeks, door-to-door, with about ten days camping in the Black Rock Desert. August 21-September 2, 2024.

**Me**: 54M from Boulder, Colorado, USA, experienced world traveler and wilderness camper, though this was my first Burning Man. While I stayed with a theme camp of about 60 people, and drove to the event with someone I met through the Colorado Burner Facebook group, I was there alone (albeit with 70,000 other Burners).

———————————————

The premise of a festival without a focused center stage or schedule has enchanted me for 20 years, since I first learned of Burning Man (though Burning Man is not a festival). And the art looked off the charts. The timing of Burning Man is most inconvenient for parents with kids in school (the week before Labor Day), so it took a while for the stars to align. With one kid safely ensconced in college and the other starting her sophomore year of high school, this seemed like an “off-year” as a parent and an “on-year” to burn (in the Burning Man parlance). Buying a ticket, packing for the event, and getting to Black Rock City take significant planning, preparation, and endeavor, though nowhere near as fascinating as the event itself (if you have questions, please message me). Reviews and pontifications about Burning Man 2024 abound online, and I hereby add to that noise.  

**A few facts about the event:** 

Burning Man occurs in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, a perfectly flat, dried-up lakebed (nicknamed “The Playa”). About 70,000 people attend each year, creating Black Rock City, a “pop-up” community. It is unique in countless ways, such as no trashcans at the event (pack it in, pack it out) and the only thing for sale in the city is ice. Burners create a giving economy (no barter, no trading, just giving). The attendees spend the week living by the 10 principles of Burning Man: Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, Radical Self-reliance, Radical Self-expression, Communal Effort, Civic Responsibility, Leaving No Trace, Participation, and Immediacy (some add an 11th of Consent). There are regional burns worldwide (including Colorado), but this one in Nevada remains the true mothership. And yes, they burnt this man at the end.

**Camp Pink Heart:** 

Most attendees stay in one of the hundreds of theme camps. These vary from irreverent to serious, artsy to boozy, and musical to sexual. I lucked into a well-established camp on Esplanade (the Broadway of Black Rock City) called Camp Pink Heart. We offer the community free ice water to any and all Burners, an ice cream social halfway through the week, and a plethora of pink furniture to lounge in our pink shade (I’d find 5-20 people sleeping on our sofas every morning). Our work shifts at camp included serving water for the thirsty Burners and chatting up the incredibly varied people wandering into our camp. 

I arrived a few days before the official start for “Build Week.” Our camp stores two shipping containers in Gerlach (the nearest town) full of shade structures, pink sofas, pink lights, industrial carpets, and more. These get dropped off on our plot a week or two before we arrive. Over a few days, we constructed our camp using ratchet straps, zip ties, 18” lag bolts drilled into the Playa, and thousands of LED lights. We had a gorgeous kitchen, a generator for electricity, a swamp cooler, a private portapotty (this is important!), one camp meal a day, and a vast shade structure over our tents (also important). The Pink Heart vibe is inclusive, kind, giving, and fun. I feel eminently fortunate to have found this group and stay there for my first Burn.

**The Desert:** 

This kind of camping is not unlike a bluegrass festival (some combination of glamping and car camping while still at the mercy of the elements), yet the Black Rock Desert is far more hostile. We experienced 45mph winds (creating white-out conditions of dust), low 50’s at night, 90+ in the day, a bit of rain, and a ton of sun. That said, 2024 is supposedly one of the more pleasant Burns weather-wise. The Playa dust is alkaline, and Burners bring a vinegar solution to spray on their feet to avoid skin damage. This higher pH environment inhibits bacterial growth, making it relatively clean and unstinky (though always dusty). It is also persistent and pernicious, clinging to everything. Once home, I had to hose off my tent twice and then wipe it down with vinegar to clean it. Speaking of tents — I bought a special tent designed by Burners for Burning Man called a Shiftpod. I’d never seen them anywhere before, but I saw thousands in Black Rock City. While a bit bulky, it's an excellent tent for most car-camping adventures. 

**The Art**

The art is off the charts. It surpassed my expectations by a thousand miles. The scope, the size, the impact, the diversity, the execution, and especially the setting. I believe this is the world’s most spectacular art exhibit, which only exists for one week a year, and you have to go to this extreme place to experience it. This extremity adds to gravity, but some of the art’s profundity supersedes the setting. 

One piece in particular called “I’m Fine” deeply struck me. The piece had 20ft high letters constructed of Ukranian roadsigns riddled with bullet holes. The premise is we casually answer “I’m fine” when asked how we are, even when that is not the case. And in Ukraine, things are not “fine.” I also read that many Ukrainians text “I’m fine:)” to tell loved ones they are alive. Lastly, an air raid siren would blast on the Playa whenever one sounded in Ukraine. 

Another piece called “Nova Heaven” was a tribute to the victims of the Super Nova Festival massacre on October 7 in Israel. The artists recreated the festival's massive, gorgeous shade structure and built several wooden spiral staircases underneath it. Each of the 407 steps had a victim's name on it, of which half were Burners (many Israelis go to Burning Man). 

I spoke with the creator of “Liberty,” and it had a political message but far less charged than “I’m Fine” or “Nova Heaven.” ""Liberty"" was a stunning and gigantic stainless steel Statue of Liberty with both hands holding the torch. You could see it shimmering from almost anywhere in Black Rock City, and it was simply awe-inspiring that this artist brought this here. I hope it has a life on display after the event. 

**The Art Cars**

These blew my mind, from the gigantic Mayan Warrior sound stage to the fever-dream road warrior vehicles to El Pulpo Magnifico to the Pizza Car (with pizza ovens in the back giving away fresh hot pizza) to the remote-control hermit crab (with the controller riding an electric Onewheel behind it!). The diversity, scope, ambition, creativity, vision, and ingenuity to make these things and bring them to the middle of nowhere to give rides around Playa for other’s pure enjoyment is inconceivably beautiful. Early in the week, I biked over to the DMV (Department of Mutant Vehicles) and found dozens of art cars lined up (all the vehicles need permits to drive both during the day and at night). I cried as I rode around, in awe that these people share their talents and bring these gifts for us to enjoy. Not a day passed where I did not stop everything and say, “Wow, look at that!” at some new art car I’d not yet seen. In fact, I said, “Wow, look at that!” at least 3000 times during the week. 

**The Temple** 

In preparation for Burning Man, I did a mountain of research, and I particularly liked this documentary (it gets going when on Playa at about 30min in), which has a tear-filled scene at the Temple. To be honest, I didn’t get it. I could not understand why people grieve or memorialize while at a giant art party in the dust. But, venturing into the Temple, I immediately grasped the concept — there is poignancy and gravity in a space filled with messages to lost loved ones, be it pets, parents, or friends. People bring huge displays, thousands of photos, and countless mementos to fill the walls of the Temple, and some grab a Sharpie and write on the walls (as I did). Hundreds of people are there at all hours, with volunteers called Temple Guardians offering support if needed. My fellow Pinkies called it “Temple Time,” and one or two laps around the Temple, reading the walls would bring most anyone to tears. I spent several hours there, writing to my deceased brothers, Salty (my favorite dog ever), and others. I wept, grieved, and am grateful to have done some Temple Time. The Temple, and everything I wrote on those walls, was burned in silence at the end of the event. 

———————————————

I had a million more experiences, from the Foam Dome, to a pop-up hotdog stand in Deep Playa with 50 flavors of mustard, to fire dancers, to the INSANE outfits (or none at all), to handing out pork belly tacos at midnight in front of Camp Pink Heart. You can talk to anyone, and if you get bored, walk just 50 feet in any direction to some other sculpture, art car, theme camp, or fellow burner. It fills your cup like nothing else, and I hope to see you in the dust next year. 

———————————————

**A few pieces of gear I liked:**

Bike: my Budnitz No. 1 made the 20 miles/day feel effortless (they are now defunct, but the Priority Sauce bike looks similar). Having a reliable and ergonomic bike proved essential for moving around Playa.

Tent: Shiftpod III Mini+ — while smaller than most Shiftpods, it has enough space for one person.

Storage: I wish I had some ubiquitous (and dust-proof) black and yellow storage bins — for clothes, food, gear, and anything else kept inside or outside my tent.

Backpack: I brought a 2.5L Osprey Syncro hydration pack for the days and an Osprey Daylite sling for the nights (which was wrapped in LEDs and EL Wire)

Pee Bottle: I used an old Gatorade bottle about five times a day and dumped it in the portos (which were not very close to my camp).

Protein Powder: I brought *Gnarly* brand, which is tasty and filling enough to supplement the free grill cheeses and random hotdogs out on PLaya.

And for research, the YouTube and Instagram feeds from Halcyon proved invaluable.",2024-09-13 20:28:58

I have a 4 week Asia trip coming up at the end of October to the end of November. I’ll be spending the first two weeks in Vietnam and the last 2 weeks in Japan and could use some advice on my plan. 

Initially the plan in Vietnam was to do Hanoi (3 days), overnight train to Sapa (4 days), return to Hanoi for a night, fly to Da Nang and explore Hue/Da Nang and Hoi An for the rest of Vietnam (4-5 days), then fly back to Hanoi and off to Osaka. 

As some of you may know, Northern Vietnam was hit with Typhoon Yagi and my heart goes out to those affected. It certainly affects my original plan a bit and I’m now looking at trying to plan it a bit differently but upon some research, it seems like it may be the rainy season in central Vietnam the time that I want to go. Should i reconsider exploring the north/north-central Vietnam and go south? With the original plan, i was hoping for a mix of a mountainous and beachy areas but upon researching I am getting mixed results about the weather and could use some clarification. 

In Japan, I was planning on staying in Osaka/Kyoto (3-4 days), then to Kanazawa (4-5 days), and then off to Tokyo for the remainder of the trip. The details haven’t really been worked out but if you have any suggestions that would be greatly appreciated. Looking for more of a naturesque experience in Japan.

Now i’m of legal age and I have the money to afford the tickets, the best seats in fact. I also have enough to afford an Uber to the place of the concert being in New York City. I’m 2 hours away from the city and the ride is around 177 dollars but i’m sure it’ll go up due to surge pricing which is fine.  I planned the time I’ll leave and go, the concert is at 3:45 pm and I plan to leave around 11am or maybe 10 as a safety net for traffic or whatever. I don’t mind being early either. I haven’t bought the tickets yet as i’m on the edge of my choice. I know all of this is possible. Is it? I’m 20, it’ll be my first ever time going ANYWHERE alone out of my city. I have my Id just in case. I plan it bring a small drawstring which will be permitted by the center per their guidelines online. This all seems pretty doable. I plan to go straight home after as it’ll end around midnight possibly. If your’re wondering what the band is it’s twenty one pilots :)

Tokyo - generally love the nightlife there and the scale of the pub crawl was insane, like 150 people.

First time doing anything on my own really. I’ve always relied on others to keep me afloat.. I know how shitty that sounds but that’s how I’ve lived my life. That’s why I decided to take this trip, learn who I am and do shit that scares me. While I love the idea of getting out to explore all this beautiful country has to offer, I also find it too easy to sit in bed on my phone all day. Or just sleep for the day to go by.

I’ve struggled with loneliness most of my life and knew it was inevitable I would experience it on my trip. Reading all about others experiences with the pros and cons of solo travel of course. I’m not one to go out and make friends with anyone I meet, which sometimes I find is one reason I’ve always relied on people. Kind of venting for no reason.. apologies people of Reddit!

My main question would be, is boredom a common experience amongst other solos? I feel like I’m the only one who isn’t making the best out of every day, just waiting for something to happen. Which is bullshit! I know I’m capable of living my best life, I guess I just don’t know where to start. I thought going on this trip in general would just change my perspective of my life all in one. But not the case! I’m isolated most of the time and keep moaning and groaning about my life. I don’t know what I want from this post.. maybe just another take from someone else’s view.


Edit** 
Thank you for everyone telling me the truth, that’s what I really wanted from this post. The truth is sometimes difficult to process, but extremely helpful in the long run. Cheers everyone!",2024-09-13 10:52:51

Recently I did a solo travel to Italy and while I was in Milan, I went to the OC Terme Milano Spa because all of the trends in TikTok about the Rain Room. 

What I didn't expect was that everyone there was with a partner or in a group of friends, there was no other solo traveller around. 

So it made me wonder, what other activities would you not recommend because it can seem too weird or awkward to do as a solo traveller? Not like the necessary things you might have to do like dining alone or going in a tour, but actual activities that sounds fun but are not though to do it alone, like fancy vineyard/wine tours or workshops.",2024-09-13 01:43:14

They're of course cheaper but they also give you an opportunity to meet new people.

That's great, I admit. However, I'm not really the type who solo travels for socialising. I'm a strong introvert, and I already have my social needs met - my gf and 2 friends I keep in touch with. I just want to see new stuff, explore at my own pace and then come back to my hoTel room so I can be alone and relax.

Maybe it's also because I'm now in my late 20s but I really don't have that strong of a desire to meet new people. I often travel with my gf but I go solo either when she doesn't feel like it or she can't take time off from work. When she's travelling solo, she books only high quality 4/5 star hotels for safety reasons, even in normally safe countries.

Of course, I assume it also depends on how long and far you're travelling. For an entire month, I can imagine the cost of hotels adds up, and you'd want to break up the monotony by meeting someone new. ",2024-09-12 16:42:30

I like talking to people and want to get to know them but most guys it feels like they’re only being nice with hope of hooking up. Most people assume I’m around 22, I think because I’m fairly confident in conversation, but this happens regardless of if they’re 20 or 30.

I am so done with talking to people, especially men, especially after I rejected a guy who wanted to meet up and he insulted me over text. I don’t want to have to worry about if a guy wants to Sex with me or not just because we’re talking. The best people I met have been where this undertone isn’t there. But it feels like every night out ends with a guy making an unwanted move on me, another girl or both. 

I wanna ask how people deal with this, while travelling and not get wore down by this? Plus, I don’t think advice like stay in female-only dorms, wear a wedding band or stay in less party hostels, I was in family hostel and got big on by a 70 yr old.

I am thinking of the following itinerary

* 3-5 nights in CDMX - I have heard there are some good hikes around here so would love some recs that can be done either solo or as part of a group/tour
* 3-8 nights in Oaxaca and Chiapas, I'd like to visit Oaxaca city, San Cristobal de las Casas/Palenque/Lagunas de Montebello
* 3-4 nights in Bacalar
* Somewhere a bit more chill on Yucatán coast for Christmas
* Maybe copper canyon train bc I am a sucker for scenic train journeys

I'd love some recs if anyone has any btw of extra places to consider!

I have been to Mexico before (not-solo) and I am fairly confident in staying as safe as possible during the day, taking into consideration the precautions you should always take, especially somewhere like Mexico (aware of your surroundings/dress appropriately/don't wear jewellery/don't get your phone out on the side of the road/don't walk around at night/don't carry all your cash/have multiple cards/don't let people know you are alone etc.)

Something I am wondering about is going out in the evenings or at night - last time I was able to go out at night no problem but I was with a male friend so I do not feel this is at all indicative of a solo female experience. What has your experience been of going out at night and getting home in Ubers alone? Is this something you've felt safe to do on your own or have you had some bad experiences? Have you avoided going out at all, even for dinner? Has this varied by place you've visited? What is the latest time you feel you should head home? For example, 9pm in Guadalajara felt a lot less safe than 9pm in Mexico city.

For further context, I don't intend to go stay out particularly late but I would like to go out to restaurants at night for dinner and maybe occasionally go to a gig for some live music but obviously walking at night is not a safe option. I do intend to stay at hostels and mostly go out as part of a group but in the off chance that doesn't happen it'd be good to hear any experiences as there's not a lot of info on this topic!",2024-09-12 20:45:38

Wondering if I should just get the jab for good measure and hope for the best, or adjust my travel plans so that I don’t go to countries that require it. Advice appreciated, especially from anyone who has gotten vaccinated while traveling. 

Edit/update: I got the shot for peace of mind. Overpaid for it in Mexico because I didn’t want to compound side effects with altitude sickness in Peru.

solotravel,1fezdhn,Missed opportunities for interactions,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fezdhn/missed_opportunities_for_interactions/,12,"Hey everybody. Was just at the airport and got talking to this nice Italian guy because we both had video cameras and were photographing the planes. Just the previous night I had been learning Italian and found this funny BBC article ( https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/italian/cool/argument.shtml ) so I had the idea to show him but never did it and we just tapped away on our phones until I had to board my plane. And then I left and kicked myself because I thought he would've found it funny and cool and it would've been a conversation topic.

Obviously probably nothing would've come of it, he probably would have laughed and nothing more but I perhaps gave it more thought in retrospect than I needed have to. I guess I'm quite a social person but sometimes I don't do something and then I think way too much about it.

I feel like solo travel you get all this opportunities to meet people but it's so easy to not take them. For example in the hostel common areas people are tapping away on their phones in the common areas, many happy to talk to each other but often nobody takes that first step. For some reason I find it more depressing than just sitting at home without these sorts of interactions presenting themselves because weirdly I feel like I haven't ""missed"" anything. 

Sometimes I do take these opportunities and long term nothing has ever come of it yet (I got some Instagram's but you never really keep in touch after a few weeks). Not that you would expect to really but every shot you don't take weighs more heavily than the ones you try and nothing comes of it. Plus sometimes you hear these stories of people who have known each other for like twenty years because of the most minor or random initial interaction. It's how I met my best friend at uni too.

I’m 22y Female, I came to Venice, Italy yesterday night and today is my second day in this hostel. 

This morning I had to reception to ask for the towel, and he gave me a towel and asked me where am I from. I said I’m Korean and he said he thought I was Chinese, and I look really sexy. I felt uncomfortable from that moment, but I didn’t want to make a scene so I just say thank you and left. 

I head to the lounge and worked on my laptop, and that receptionist came to put the bed sheets down to the lounge. 

He says that he loves me, and ask me if I love him too. I really don’t get why this person asks this so randomly to me so I just said I don’t understand what you’re trying to say. He keeps asked me if I love him and I said I have a boyfriend. 

He said my face looks good and asked me if I want to have s3x with him. Of course I don’t want so I strongly said no several times, and he keeps telling me he has another private room in this building and ask for having s3x with him. 

I neglected several time and he left after that. I didn’t tell this to the manager of this facility but I already feel so frustrated since it’s not even the other guest but the staff of this facility that I’m gonna stay for few nights. I talked with my boyfriend about this but still I’m scared of what’s going to happen, or how the owner would react. I'm afraid of retaliation.

I’m going to tell this to the manager of this facility and the website that I used for making a reservation. I feel afraid about making a scene, please anyone give me advice about this situation.

Edited:! 14.Sep.2024


Hello, guys. Final update.

Thanks for concerning and cheering for the last time. It really encouraged me a lot and helpful practically and mentally as well 🥹

First, I tried to contact through booking.com, I asked for the number of owner, I contacted with that number. I asked if he’s the owner of the facility because I wanted to make sure if I’m secured and safe to talk to him about this. He said he is not (which is someone gave me a different number, not the actual number of the owner) and refused to give me the actual number of the owner. And he told me to come to the hostel in the morning to meet him. Which I thought was quite a ridiculous thing to say.

After that, I saw someone left a review at google map after I post this, and the owner replied to that review to contact her. I contacted her, and she asked me about the situation and appearance of him. I told her every detail of situation and his appearance, name, etc. She sincerely apologized to me and promised me this kind of incident is never should have been happened and never going to happen anymore in that facility. She showed me a deep empathy toward this situation. And showed me thank for reaching out and report. And I got promised for the refund for whole stay. I didn’t reach out for the police since I didn’t have enough time in Italy but still think wish I would for the further incident that can be happened.

So… that’s how it all figured out. I will not able to do this all things without your all encouragement. I’m happy that I was able to report this situation and speak up. I also want to encourage all the people to not just tolerate sexual harassment and speak up for other women. Even though I felt so frustrated to report, explain, writing review, concerning about retribution but I’m sure that it was really important and worth to speak up.

I wouldn’t put any more words about that facility since I wouldn’t know how my words are going to affect.

Thanks again for sharing your opinion and numerous encouragement. I sincerely hope you all be happy, peace, and safe. I’ll always wish you all the luck : )",2024-09-11 11:00:55

Travel within vietnam: mostly flights for long time, one train journey (if feasible) and rest taxi and buses for nearby areas.

Also, it might be a long post, so please bear with me, for a few places I'll also be giving options. Also if this looks like I'll be burning out myself please suggest that too.

Thanks a lot in advance!

But... There is no window in my room. Or no, there is a window but to another room!!! Yeah, that's correct. There are blinds but if I wanted, I could wave to my neighbors from second room, especially since only I have blinds... And you know what, I hear everything what they do. They kiss etc. I hope I won't have to hear them having sex


The check-in process was a nightmare. AirBnB owner wanted to get exact time when I arrive to his place. I said I'll be around 6pm. I was 10 minutes late (6:10pm) and he told me to wait another 15minutes.
What the hell? There was supposed to be a reception from 15 to 23 (it was written on their page on airbnb).

And the worst is that I paid 80$ per night. If I paid 100$ I could have a decent hotel...

I feel like I was more comfortable in a hostel in a room of 8 people than here, where I am now.

Not sure if this is ok for this forum, I am looking to try dm with my dog in Spain later this year.

The company I had considered who would drive my dog to Spain for me fell through and it’s very late now to find another one that is not mass transport.

How would you get your small dog to spain if you were me?

I have recently driven 2000km with her and know I can do this and take leshuttle - but southern Spain is a lot further than I want to drive.

I have some friends who have flown with their dog in cabin and it’s the most cost effective and my dog would be with me for the duration.

As I am alone and it would be the first time flying I am a bit stressed and thinking if I should break it up eg fly lhr to Paris and from there to Malaga. 

Or could I take trains? Worried about taking my luggage and her and managing this…

Any other suggestions?

I do not plan to leave my dog behind, she does enjoy travelling with me and has been on trains, packed tubes, at the airport (but not flown), ships, shopping centres etc. 

Many thanks for your ideas !

solotravel,1feah3f,Ways to afford/realize longer-term solo travel ,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1feah3f/ways_to_affordrealize_longerterm_solo_travel/,17,"Hi! I'm just after my first longer international trip (Morocco, which was amazing! Done half solo, half with a friend), and think that I missed out on something great so far - I have travelled quite a bit in the last years, but those were mostly shorter trips to close destinations. I would love to see more of different cultures in the future.

Next year, I'm planning to move out of Poland, where I'm currently living as an Expat, and back to my home country. Since I will also switch jobs, I think this might be a perfect moment for a bit of a longer trip - with no rent to pay and being inbetween jobs. I would love to spend some time travelling Asia or possibly New Zealand/Australia (Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan are all places of interest for me, although I won't cover them in the same trip ofc! I'm thinking of anywhere between 1-3 months of travel, possibly more?)

Now when I think about this, my main barriers are finances: I do have some savings, but I'm not sure how far they would get me. I would be willing to work/volunteer if needed - but am equally unsure how far that would get me. 

My second worry would be finding a job afterwards - the thought of just quitting with no concrete back-up in hand is slightly terrifying to me, tbh, although I would be able to stay with my parents afterward the trip for a while, so it's not like I would fall really hard, even if I can't find something right away. The other option ofc would be to find something starting three/X months from when I would like to travel, and just come back from my trip to a new job. My worry there would be that I don't know how realistic it is to plan such a trip that short-term. 

You see, a lot of questions/worries and I am honestly not sure where to start with this. I know a lot of these depend on myself (how much of a budget am I willing to spend, how spontaneously am I willing to go, etc.), but I just feel clueless as to how to even start drafting/organising something like this. The thought of such a trip is super exciting for me though, and I feel it might be the perfect moment to go through with it! 

I know there are countless ressources on the internet (and starting my research on those!), but I guess what I'm looking for here is personal experiences - how have you organized your travels, maybe in a similar situation? Is there anything I should keep into account as a more or less first time-traveller? Appreciate any input, really :) Thank you!",2024-09-11 13:44:20
solotravel,1fegypw,"Going to Athens and Budapest, tips and suggestions",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fegypw/going_to_athens_and_budapest_tips_and_suggestions/,9,"Hi, I'm planning a trip to go to Athens for a few days during October, but given the boat schedules and dealing with the luggage back and forth, I am planning on staying only in Athens and going on a planned trip to Delphi and Meteora, and then fly to and spend some days in Budapest.

In total I'll be 5 days in Greece (1 going to Delphi, sleeping in Meteora and going back to Athens; so 1.5-2 days), and on the 5th day go to Budapest and stay 2 full days and leave on the 4th. The first day will be 50/50 Athens-Budapest.

I thought about Budapest because it is relatively close and cheap by plane, and because the 3 flights are direct and affordable, otherwise if I'd go to another part of Greece the flight back would cost a lot or have 18h in Milan or any random place, or I'd have to go back to Athens and I haven't found a good path and I'm worried about not being on time.

So more or less 3 full days in Athens, 2 in Delphi/Meteora/Athens, 1 morning in Athens-flight-rest of the day in Budapest, 2 full days in Budapest and 1 morning in Budapest and flight back home.

Is there another option you recommend besides Budapest? Athens is the main objective and want to take a few more days to make it more worth it and so

I also plan on going to Hotels mainly but there are a few hostels that look nice and cheap, although I have never been in one and have doubts about it, like noisy roommates, or being noisy myself, sharing bathroom etc what do you suggest?

Thanks",2024-09-11 18:11:24
solotravel,1fdp324,The stereotype and racism in solo trips really annoy me,330,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fdp324/the_stereotype_and_racism_in_solo_trips_really/,298,"

I mean, 99% of the people I meet on my journey are friendly or act like normal people.

But there are some moments that really frustrate me.

I have an Asian appearance, but I’m not a Chinese, and in the past twenty days, more than a dozen people have greeted me with ""how are you"" in Chinese. However, when I speak Chinese, we don’t really have a culture of small talk, and we certainly don’t say ""how are you.""

Many people ask if I am Chinese or Japanese, and a guy even told me to go back to China (and the part where he later asked if I wanted a BJ as compensation is another story).

I know sometimes they want to be friendly or that they mean no harm; they’re usually willing to listen when I explain. But when you encounter dozens of the same situation, it really feels strange. 

Do you have similar experiences?",2024-09-10 18:28:20

I've always dreamed of visiting Southeast Asia and think it is time to make it happen. I've been researching different options and have gravitated toward Thailand as a perfect destination for this. I am a 34 year old man, travelling alone. I have experience backpacking around Europe and South America, but this will be my first time in Asia. My budget is fairly flexible - not looking to spend money just to spend it and don't really have a taste for luxury anyway, but I am also not afraid to splurge on either very unique experiences or things that would make my life significantly easier. Priorities on this trip include, in no particular order: food, nature, architecture/history. I'm not explicitly coming for partying/drugs/sex but if I'm being honest I'm not completely averse to those things either. I've always gotten on well within ""hostel culture"" though if I'm being honest I have a few more years and a few more wrinkles since I last partook. Here is what I have so far: 

Days 1-3: Land in Chiang Mai. For unrelated reasons I'll be flying in from S Korea so the jet lag shouldn't be horrendous. Plan to explore the city, markets, temples, maybe do an elephant reserve. 

Days 4-6: Bus to Pai. Spend a few days hanging out with hippies, visit the hot springs, bike around, try different food, etc

Day 7: Early bus back to Chiang Mai, eventually flight down to Surat Thani where I'll crash one night. 

Days 8-13: Boat over to Kho Phangan. My travel dates mostly likely do not line up with Full Moon. Instead I'll enjoy some of the other electronic music parties (love bass music, psytrance, etc), more time hanging on the beach with hippies, beautiful scenery, water activities, etc. 

Days 14-18: Finally time for Bangkok and all it has to offer. Likely a day trip to Ayutthaya built in. Otherwise exploring the city, catching up on any Thai foods I havent tried yet, markets, temples, etc. May get a soapy massage 🤫

Day 19: Fly home 

How did I do? What did I miss or screw up? Any recs regarding specific activities, restaurants, places to stay? Any other tips? All comments greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",2024-09-11 16:26:13

solotravel,1fdc6q6,Solotravel makes me feel happy and relaxed,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fdc6q6/solotravel_makes_me_feel_happy_and_relaxed/,47,"I only started solotravelling when I was 30, but since then I take a long (three weeks) solo trip every year. 

While I'm always a bit nervous before I go (especially if the journey is complex or the destination isn't super safe), as soon as I have arrived and settled in I relax so much more than when I'm travelling with other people. 

I like travelling with my best friend or boyfriend. I laugh more, it's lovely to share these memories. But it's also more stressful to me. Growing up I travelled with my parents every summer to the sea - my father was a choleric and my stepmother would be annoyed with children all the time, so I learned from childhood to try assess the emotions of others, prevent moodswings, keep them happy. My happiest childhood memories are of moments when I was alone. And it's hard to unlearn these things. My best friend has lots of anxieties and I'm often going out of my way to keep her happy and compromise a lot. My boyfriend is frustrated easily and again, I'm trying to prevent that. They wouldn't ever hurt me, but still I can't stop being overly empathetic and worrying about them being happy and feeling nervous or unhappy whenever they do.

So, whenever I'm travelling alone, I'm at peace. I'm happy and so, so relaxed. It recharges my batteries. I'm not frustrated easily, I'm a really calm person and if I face a problem I usually just try to solve it as best as I can and if something annoying happens I'm annoyed for a short time and then let it go. While travelling alone, I can let go of all the people pleasing, I just need to please myself and that's easy - I'm happy when I see a beach, a jungle, a cute town, a piece of cake. I take a vacation from myself. I never had any problems of feeling lonely or awkward because I liked being alone since childhood.

Sometimes it would be nice to share a moment with someone who means something to me or to have a second brain available or just help - but well, nothing is ever perfect. I still do trips with friends and boyfriend (never with the family though) and I truly do enjoy them, even if they are not as relaxing as being solo. 

Tomorrow though I'm going solo again to South East Asia and while I'm a bit nervous right now, I'm also excited for new adventures, lots of peaceful moments and lots of time for myself. ",2024-09-10 07:29:28

solotravel,1fe3daf,Need advice: would a tour group suit my personality *Indonesia G Adventure ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fe3daf/need_advice_would_a_tour_group_suit_my/,11,"First of all, I did look through all the previous posts regarding group tours and got a lot of good info. 

I’ve been solo travelling for one year, and am very burnt out on discovering itinerary. Up til now I’ve very much just showed up to a country and enjoyed wandering around rather than seeing a specific site or going somewhere famous to see, so far in Asia I’ve loved cycling around Beijing as a highlight of two months. But I’m open to a different way of travel.

Although my style has great benefits, like being invited to a wedding in Türkiye in a random village, or helping a family with the construction of their house in Argentina, it also has drawbacks of generally taking a lot of effort to get around; hard to build a travel plan for a destination that is unknown. And with language barrier in Asia it hasn’t reaped the same rewards as the joy of improving my Spanish in rural South America. 

So basically for a year I have travelled slow and just went with the flow, haven’t made too many travels since I don’t have too much interest in seeing specific sites, and not many people were too keen for showing up to a bus station and just taking a bus somewhere. I’ve been blessed with time of course which is a luxury. 

For Indonesia I thought it could be nice to just show up and have someone do all the logistics for you for two weeks and eliminate any decision making. So far I’ve only done day tours but I really did not enjoy getting shoved into a minivan to spend the whole day driving and stop off 5 times in a day. Are long tours the same vibe or is there also adventure feeling to the whole thing?? Please help, if this long question even makes sense 😅",2024-09-11 06:12:52

solotravel,1fdx1g0,Thoughts about solo traveling,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fdx1g0/thoughts_about_solo_traveling/,0,"A few weeks ago, got my feet wet doing a weeklong solo trip. Nothing too fancy or too far, but had a lot of fun. For me, the definition of a solo trip would be to travel by myself where I am not meeting anyone I know at the destination. I have gone on plenty of business and leisure trips solo, but always meet up with someone I know on the other side.

Technically, this was not my first real solo trip. A few years ago, I did a quick weekend solo trip. It was a quick and spur-of-the-moment trip where I just wanted to get away for the weekend before starting a new job the following week. Just called up my wife and let her know that I was going to be gone for a few days. When she asked where I was going, that was when I realized that I hadn't thought things out too far yet.

I truly had no plan or idea where I was going, so was driving in the direction of the airport, but while lost in thought while driving, didn't realize until much later that I had passed the airport, so just decided to keep on driving. At some point, got hungry, and figured that I would stop and eat, and figure it out then... except that made me sleepy, and it was already pretty late, so just checked into a hotel, with the plan to get up extra early to figure out where I would end up at, and then go.

This is the first point of traveling solo that I realized was so awesome. I can do it any way that I want,. I was able to make decisions on-the-fly without consulting anyone, and could change my mind on-the-fly, and no one will bug me about it.

As I continued that weekend trip, while driving down the freeway, I noticed signs on buildings that were advertising my favorite beer ""805"", and realized that I was passing by the Firestone-Walker Brewing Company. Of course I just had to stop, and went into the restaurant/bar they have inside. I was originally planning to drive down further south, but after a few beers, decided that I would stay in Paso Robles and just chill for a few days. By chance, I hadn't taken my golf clubs out of my car on my way out the door, so I got to go golfing as well.  

When I went to a bar later that night, a lot of locals were chatting with me, and I thought I was only going to spend an hour or two there, but ended up staying there for several hours just drinking and chatting with so many people. 

The second point of traveling solo is that I get to meet a lot of interesting people. I noticed that if I am by myself, I am a lot more approachable than if I am traveling with other people. No one feels that they are intruding if you are sitting by yourself, minding your own business, and if you see some fun people having a good time, it's really easy to approach them by yourself.

The rest of that weekend was just very chill and all at my place.

So for weeklong solo trip, armed with some ideas from that weekend trip, I decided to split it up into two parts. I had exactly 7 days, so I spent the first 3.5 days just about 30 minutes south of my home in Santa Cruz CA at a somewhat secluded resort I like. I remember arriving late afternoon, and after checking into my room, I changed my clothes, and headed to the pickleball courts since they have a Friday afternoon social. Met some people that were really cool, and kept bumping into them at the resort. My purpose for this part of the trip was just to spend some time alone and just read a lot. And I did do a lot of that, but the people I met were so cool, I would spend time with them at the pool, getting drinks, etc.

One thing about traveling solo and meeting new people... and I mentioned this in another thread a while back... always just enjoy the moment. I really enjoyed talking with all of these different people, but never was under the illusion that I would ever talk to them again. I didn't exchange contact info with them, and instead, just enjoyed their company for the few hours we spent together. In the past, I have exchanged contact info with people I have met while traveling only to be disappointed that they don't respond to my calls or email. I now just focus to live in the moment.

The second part of my trip was in Las Vegas. I go there a lot for business conferences, and see a lot of cool things that I want to check out, but never have time to do, so this was the time for me to do it. I was also there because a professional pickleball tournament was happening, and they even had a pickleball camp associated with the tournament, so went to that, and was actually coached by the pro players themselves! It was awesome! I did both things I had been wanting to do for a long time, and things that I normally do when visiting this time, but it was so much more relaxed, and so easy to do everything on my own time.

If anything I have discovered from traveling solo, the main takeaways for me would be:

1. You can be as planned out or as a spontaneous as you want. For me, for the week long trip, I planned out my flight and hotels, and everything else just happened organically.  
2. It feels like time has been extended when not traveling together with anyone else, and without having to keep a schedule in order to meet people at a certain time.  
3. You will run into things that catch your eye serendipitously, and explore it right away. I had so many such moments where I wanted to check out something that looked really cool to me, and didnt' have to worry about making people wait for me, or just getting separated from the rest of the group.  
4. Without even really trying, you can meet all kinds of interesting people while traveling solo. Sometimes they may even be a fellow solo traveler!",2024-09-11 00:14:46

Oh and I don’t speak Spanish but trying to learn basic phrases before I go! I’ll have an e-sim so hoping to rely on google translate if I need it….

I’m conscious of seeing as much as possible whilst having time to relax and being safe.

I plan on basing myself in these areas below and will use that as a base to explore nearby areas… unless of course there are specific area anyone thinks I should see/ stay at. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated. I’m roughly aware of the main attraction points around these areas (hey google!) but please shout out any of your MUST SEEs or hidden gems. 

Arrive Cancun, head over to Isla Mujeres straight

Isla Mujeres 4 day 3 nights

Isla Holbox  4 day 3 nights

Valladolid  5 days 4 nights

Merida 10 days 9 nights

Campeche. 4 day 3 nights

Bacalar	4 day 3 nights

Tulum. 6 days 5 nights

Playa del Carmen 3 days 2 nights

Leave for Cancun airport straight from Playa del Carmen

I will land in Lisbon and stay in Barrio Alto for a few days. I need to decide where I am staying Friday 10/4, Saturday 10/5, and Sunday 10/6 before I meet my friends outside of Coimbra on Monday 10/7 for a meditation retreat (specifically Póvoa de Midões, Tábua)

I am very into nature and gardens and whimsical art. Looking for something low key as I make my way north. I will be traveling by bus most likely but am open to a train if it makes sense. I would love help figuring out which towns or villages to look for a room in and any advice on transportation between places. I’m hoping to find unique, nature filled places that are on the quieter side where I can slow down, journal, and sketch. I am happy to spend each night in a different place. 

I found a farm in Sintra that I may stay at on Friday night but am open to other suggestions. 

Can anyone point me in a direction of what towns are worth looking at between Lisbon/ Sintra and Coimbra?

I’ve prepaid so in theory I should be able to still stay (I will obviously have my passport for ID) and just pay for things with cash while I’m there, but I’m freaking out as obviously going alone means I can’t just transfer the money to a friend and get them to use their card.

solotravel,1fcx49m,US solo trip from the old continent,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fcx49m/us_solo_trip_from_the_old_continent/,10,"Hey everyone! I'm a guy in my mid 20s, born and raised in Italy. I've traveled quite extensively throughout Europe and I've been to the US four times already - my previous long term partner is American so I've gotten to know the country and the culture pretty well. I've been to Florida and the Mid West. However, I've never traveled solo before - I will be staying in Texas for a couple weeks at the end of this month for a 3 day work conference, after which I'll be traveling around the Lone Star state. My itinerary is Dallas - San Antonio - Austin - Houston. Needless to say I'm extremely excited.

I assume the majority of users in here are American so I'm curious to hear any advice you might have for me - in these past few years I've gotten to know and love the United States, its culture, its scenery, its variety of foods so I'm not expecting any sort of cultural shock.

However, from what I've seen and read online, I feel like very few foreigners travel solo to ""less touristy"" states such as Texas. Is that true? I know Americans are extremely friendly, however I feel like I'd bond more with fellow travelers rather than with random people hanging out with their friends but again I might be wrong. 

I'm looking for any sort of advice you might have for me -  are these large Texan cities mostly safe? Are late night, drunk, crowds friendly? Tips and tricks to save money on Uber/Bolt? Should I withdraw any sort of cash or can I just use my credit card?

I'll make sure to write an after trip review to share my experience once I get back. Thanks!",2024-09-09 18:50:32

On the 3rd day I have an early flight at 7:00 leaving from the Vienna airport. I’d like to get some advice on what to do since I’m not sure if sleeping alone at an airport is the safest option, but at the same time it feels as if staying at a hostel for only a few hours does not make much sense. I’ve checked online about sleeping at Vienna airport but I’m still not sure on what option to choose. 

Also, to be more specific my plan is to leave at 7:00 from Vienna then go to Bergamo to spend the day and then at around 18:00 getting a flight back home as it’s cheaper than flying from Vienna straight home. ",2024-09-09 19:02:55

Lately, I've been questioning the connection I have with someone. I'm getting tired of meeting someone new, getting to know them and then 1 or 2 days later, they check out and never seeing them again. Even the same conversation happens with every new person (Where are you from? What brings you here in (city)? Where are you going next?). I mean it's nice to have someone to talk to in your dorm, and I feel less lonely during my solo trip, but it can get exhausting having to start over every time I meet someone new. Even if we decide to exchange contact information, it ends up us never chatting, me being left on read or me end up deleting this person from Facebook because I barely know this person (after meeting for just 1 day) to see my post/photos. This gives me false hope that we'll meet again. So, I promised myself to not get attach to anyone I meet at hostels because there's no point when I know I'm never going to see them. Maybe if we live nearby after our travels, it could be a different story, but that's impossible with each and every person, if I live in the US and they live abroad. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but hostel friendship feels fake to me. I've heard people actually meeting up again after staying at one hostel, but this never happened to me and so far, I've stayed at 8 hostels according to Hostelworld.",2024-09-09 04:40:00

In Budapest, everyone in my dorm room was around my age. I was at the lowest point of my trip, just having split from my friend and feeling homesick. These people were so funny, we had a group chat and couldn't stop laughing so we had to leave and do a night out together.

We did karaoke and then watched the sun rise. Despite the tiredness, I will never forget that night. I discovered two South Americans out of the group were going Bratislava so I decided to join them. We then went Prague, where we split and it was just me and this other guy. We stayed in Vienna for a week together.

This dude was the exact same energy as me, same sense of humour, extremely similar. We were deranged together, which made an agonisingly long week in expensive Vienna all worth it -- and we had an amazing night out (and a terrible one!) All that mattered was that we had amazing time together.

Now we're both home, and it hurts. I was so fortunate to find a ""travel buddy"" by the end of my trip, and I don't regret a single day of my trip.",2024-09-08 22:31:35
solotravel,1fcougq,Taiwan Three Week Itinerary,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fcougq/taiwan_three_week_itinerary/,14,"Hi all,

I'll be in Taiwan from mid October until first week of November and I'm drafting my itinerary to the island. I''l be flying to/from Taipei International so I'm looking for a loop itinerary. I like outdoor activities (hiking especially) and small town rather then big cities. I don't fancy hotels nor BnB so I'm looking to stay in hostels with shared dorms whenever possible.

These are some more details:  
- total time: 20 days  
- budget: 2000 euros (potentially more but I'd rather not)  
- no car rental only public transportation  
- cheap accommodation like hostels with shared dorms  


Currently I'm a bit undecided whether to go East or West. East seems more wild and mainly focused on seaside activities whether the West seems more urbanized but with more hiking activities.   
One reason why I'm thinking to opt for the West coast is also that the Taroko National Park seems to be closed due to the earthquake in April. Can someone confirm this?

How's the hostel culture in Taiwan? Are them easy to find? COuld you recommend any nice hiking trail worth doing while on the island?

Here is my rough itinerary as well (the trip is not for about 5 months so I don’t have things too a T yet)

Day 1 Arrive in joburg
Day 2 explore / shop a bit
Day 3 Travel to Volunteer work area (Tzaneen)
Days 4-34 Volunteer / Spend days off exploring 
Days 35-38 Jeffreys bay
Days 39-52 Volunteering again 
Days 52-56 Cape Town 
Day 57 Fly home 

I know this is not a very planned itinerary but I am also hoping for some advice on places to visit & possibly stay. 
I am mostly going to SA for the animals and both places I am volunteering at are animal sanctuary’s.
I’m not super duper into shopping & have a current mobility issue that prevents me from hiking/ doing long walks so anything fun that happens to not include those would be amazing, But I do love food and am hoping to try lots of new things while I’m there so any recommendations on things to try while I’m over there would be great!

Currently planning a 2.5- 3 month trip to Southeast Asia and I'm hoping to get feedback on my itinerary. It's gonna be end of Jan-March. How's the pacing? What do I need more/ less time for? I'm not really concerned about budget (though don't want to spend $$$ on something that isn't worth it). I love nature, history, culture, food. Are there any absolute must-sees I'm missing??

**Singapore (2-3 days).** National Museum of Singapore, the Botanical Gardens, and cloud forest, flower dome in the garden by the bay.

**Malaysia**- Haven't really planned this leg of the trip yet but mostly just want to eat a bunch of food here!

**Kuala Lumpur (3-5 days)**

**Cameron Highlands (3 days)** sip tea, hike

**George Town (3 days)**

**Ko Samui?-** I guess I'll fly in here? (4 days). I'm honestly conflicted about this part of the journey. I want to attend a full moon party in Ko Phangan, maybe go to the Big Buddha and Namuang waterfall. Love beaches and nature, hate overtouristed hellholes. What islands are worth visiting? Which should I actively avoid? Is the diving actually good? (I live in Aus where the diving is world class).

**Bangkok (5-7 days)**- Flying in. SOOO many things I want to do here! Grand palace, Wat Pho, Wat Saket, Wat Arun, floating markets, Chinatown, see some boxing, see a ladyboy show, have a massage, KhaoSan. Also want to day trip to Ayyuthaya.

**Khao Yai National Park (2 days)**. I'm concerned about the 2.5 hour taxi ride- will I be safe as a solo female?

**Chiang Mai (4 days)**

-Yet another flight.

Temples, the Elephant Nature Park, Doi Inthanon

Sukhothai? It's a 4 hour bus or 1 hour flight so idk if it's really worth the trouble of 2-3 days.

**Chiang Rai (2 days).** Want to see the White Temple. 2 days so I don't feel rushed, maybe avoid some of the tourists by staying overnight, maybe relax w a fish pedicure :)

**Huay Xai- (3 days)** Gibbon Trek. This seems so cool!

**-2 Day Makong Cruise.**

**-Luang Prabang (3 days).** Pak Ou caves, unexploded ordinances information centre, The Royal Palace, Mount Phousi, The alms ceremony, maybe Kayaking the Mekong River

**-Vang Vieng (1 day).** Go tubing? Climb Pha Poak Mtn.

**Vientiane (1 day)** Buddha Park, Pha That Luang

**Fly to Phnom Penh (2 days)**. Royal palace, nat museum, killing fields, try a Khmer massage

**Kompong Luang (1 day)**- homestay

**Kratie (2 days)** Really just want to try and see some dolphins, but it's a long journey.

**Sambor Prei Kuk (1 day)** Check out the temple complex

**Siem Reap (8 days).** Gonna get the 7 day Angkor Wat pass and really take our time. I know it's a long time, but it's a world wonder, a massive temple complex, and this is a once in a lifetime trip! We want to enjoy the sunrises in Angkor each morning and take siestas in the afternoon. Any reccs for when we are in Siem Reap? Gonna check out the landmine museum, maybe get a blind massage?

**Fly to Hanoi (3 days).**

**Ninh Binh (2 days)** -trang an and hang mua cave

**Ha Long Bay Cruise (2 days)**

**Sapa Trek (2 days)**

**Phong Na National Park (2 days)**  
Caves!

**Hue (1 day)** Imperial sanctuary

**Da Nang (2 days)** Marble mountains, golden bridge

I remember paying a taxi driver so I could follow him to find my hostel in veneto Italy as I was going in circles. I only used only hostels in off season so often dorms were empty. 
I'm 50 now and work in tech in Canada and recently resigned from a big corporate megacorp. I had 3 weeks between jobs so I booked the cheapest flight leaving tomorrow to (Guatemala) return. After few days there I decided keeping going maybe El Salvador but decided Panama City for a sea change. 
Panama City was like Dubai in buildings and found a great area (via Argentina) with UNIDO coffee and wonderful hotel (principe) and area is full of digital expats and really safe. 
I decided to use my extra week to pop across to Colombia (Bogota) had $200 return direct flights so here I am finishing 5 days here. 
*Tips*
- local SIM cards for data are cheap as airolo is difficult to connect at times 
- Download local map of city (offline) on google maps so without data your able to navigate 
- don't look like a Florida twat tourist & keep phone away after you have your directions for a few blocks 
- wifi - remember all big chain hotels will let you use their wifi in lobby if you're stuck
- save coffee places or restaurants ahead of time and then use the epicentre as where the area of your hotel should be 
- note for runners lots of cities close roads on Sundays to let runners run marathons or fun runs I've seen it in Bogota & Guatemala. Use this research to do as activity. Very family friendly 
- steak - okay in Colombia they have amazing steaks for $10-20 that actually have flavour. If you think Costco steaks are the best you'll be educated on what steak should taste like. Grass fed meat has real flavour. 
- Spanish- I've struggled honestly and embarrassed at times mixing with French.  They appreciate effort even with some English words and hand gestures 
- luggage- I brought a backpack with 8-10 tshirts socks underwear. Under 12kg / 24lb bag as carry on. 
- flight- I booked combination flight via Expedia so $900 return. United & AeroMexico. Then I used Copa Air $200 return to Panama then Wingo $200 return to Bogota. 
- accommodation- only hotels $65-100/ night.

Hopefully this helps lurkers on the fence on travel that want to try but are scared. This has helped my confidence, energy levels and obviously no shrooms or weed for a few weeks my body feels normal again. Though travel weary as I head back home via airports this week the few thousand has improved my mental health, coffee knowledge and overall understanding of how fucking cool Colombia is. It's safe if you use travel common sense.

**edit**
In my 20s I did OneWorld around the world flights that are only $3k-5k depending on destinations and is an around the world fare. https://www.oneworld.com/round-the-world if I had 2 months off to travel work remotely I'd jump on this. Travel isn't expensive if you choose low season time periods and avoid ""Top 10 Bali"" posts. My total airfare is only $1500 CAD that's the price of Toronto return flights for me. Hey I don't always pick right tonight I'm in a $67 love hotel room with a hot tub next to the bed. Hotels promoted it and only 1 review so I took punt.

I landed in Athens after an hour delay from my flight at 10pm and it took two hours for my taxi to get here. Ended up in a hostel near Rafina where there was someone moving the entire time so I couldn’t sleep. I had a ferry today at 7:20 and got ready 3 hours ago with no sleep and I was having trouble booking a Taxi so I walked 5 km uphill with a 20lb backpack and missed my ferry by one minute without anything to eat.

I(20M) can’t help but feel discouraged about traveling, I really love it and I know there’s going to be some low points, I’m really trying to stay positive since my Ferry is booked for tomorrow but that means I have like 36 hours max on the island I’m going to. But I feel so alone in a new country where it feels like everything is going wrong. What do I do? How do you come back from a bad day?",2024-09-09 05:33:24
solotravel,1fck057,Alternatives to Jakarta and tips for Indonesia ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fck057/alternatives_to_jakarta_and_tips_for_indonesia/,18,"Hi, everyone,
I'll be solo traveling for the second time one about a week and I'm still planning my trip to Indonesia (kind of last minute I know).
What I've learned from my first trip is that while I'm not really a ""party guy"", being in a social hostel is important to meet people, get dinner with someone etc... I'm 24M, like hiking, seeing nice sights, learning about the culture and cool sports that some people would consider extreme (wakeboard, kitesurf, sky diving, ...)

Knowing all of this, I have some questions for people who know Indonesia:

- I am landing in Jakarta late on a Wednesday and need to be at 6pm in Surabaya on the Friday for a volcano tour. I thought this would leave me 2 days to explore Jakarta. However after reading about it, I'm not sure I want to go anymore. I am definitely a mall person (which seems to be the main attraction) and I personally hated LA (and people say it's similar). What are your opinions? What would you do if you were in Jakarta? Do you have alternatives? I was thinking of Yogyakarta but it would feel like rushing it. I can also possibly change my flight to directly land there maybe if people say Jakarta is really not worth it? Otherwise are there any day trip from Jakarta worthwhile?

- Then I have about 10-11 days after the volcano tour. They drop me in Bali. I am quite skeptical about Bali as: I'm happy to party one night or two but don't plan to go to the other side of the world just to go to clubs every night, and I'm solo traveling and it seems to be a place for couples. I would enjoy a more adventurous thing with less people but nice hostel I think. That being said, Bali seems to be central to explore islands for 2 days, come back and move to another island. So I was thinking of still going, and try to go to ubud, maybe Nusa Penida (although it seems to be suuuuuper touristy), Lombok, Gili and maybe Komodo. Ideally I would then fly to yogyakarta for 1 day or 2 and then back to Jakarta to flight back. In this time, I aldo plan to do my open water. If you have suggestions for that, I'm also interested. What are your thoughts?

Recommendations are in a comment.

I just finished 4 days in Phuket, never have I seen destination more hated than this one at this sub, searching here for tips, the main tip was to not go at all lol.

But because flights arrangements I decide to still go, and it was fun. It was weird, the sex tourism is in every corner, harassing you, the streets has no sidewalks, the taxis are expensive, Bangla street is more shady than you can imagine. But I still had fun…

It was chaotic and refreshing from the euro trips I am used to, I kept thinking “finally something different“ with every street I crossed, even enjoyed, if you can call it that from the absurdity of walking in the street and being afraid of cars.

But what truly saved it was the people I met, mostly at the hostel, I did not feel safe going out in the night at Patong - Bangla by myself. Having pub crawl at the hostel really helped with getting to know the place, and at the next day I met people at the hostel and we went out together, it was a blast.

I was really debating if I should stay at Hostel or Hotel, the decision to stay at hostel saved that trip for me.

The old town was also beautiful, elephant sanctuary was amazing, temples and museums were great.

Overall with that in mind I would recommend staying there because I had fun, but it will be up on u to try and meet people to make it better.

I stayed at Lub D.

I am planning a \~3 month trip starting at end April 2025. I am planning on going to SE Asia/Aus/NZ (from the UK) and wanted to see if my proposed route is sensible. I've done some research already and want to travel to Australia nearer to the beginning of my trip and then work backwards from there up to Singapore, to try take advantage of the (hopefully) nice weather at that time. This does mean I'll be in SE Asia for the rainy season, but looks like I'm going to have to compromise somewhere. Unfortunately, I'm not flexible on the start date of my trip.

I haven't really planned the intinerary in each country yet. Will do this once I've got the route finalised, but I've tried to add in what I'd like to see/do in each country where possible.

**Route:**  
London -> Thailand for 5 days. This is to break up the trip on the way to Australia, and I was in Thailand earlier this year so I don't really feel like I need to spend much time here, other than seeing what I missed on my previous trip.

Thailand -> Australia for c21 days. Planning to start in Perth, then Cairns (for snorkelling and/or diving mainly), Brisbane, Sydney and then Melbourne.

Australia -> Fiji for 7 days. Fly out to Fiji from Melbourne for one week to see the islands.

Fiji -> New Zealand for c14 days. Planning on seeing both islands here. Open to suggestions on recommendations. Will be flying into and out from Auckland.

New Zealand -> Indonesia for 10 days. Want to spend the majority of my time in Balie, but open to recommendations for elsewhere. Will want to visit Gilly Island as well.

Indonesia -> The Philippines for 7 days.

The Philippines -> Vietnam for c14 days. Will be travelling the full length of Vietnam.

Vietnam -> Cambodia for 4 days. Only really want to see Angkor Wat and Phnom Penh so don't need long here.

Cambodia -> Malaysia for 3 days. Only here to visit Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia -> Singapore for 4 days. End the trip in Singapore before flying back to London.

Any thoughts on the possible budget for this trip would be appreciated as well, if anyone has done something similar. I'll be staying in a mix of hotels and hostels (probably around a 60-70/30-40 split respectively).

Does this route make sense from a travelling perspective, and am I able to take advantage of the nice weather where possible? Also open to any improvements or countries I've missed out on. Thanks in advance.",2024-09-08 20:35:27

He often springs negative feedback on me on times that are totally inappropriate and often he has gotten confused. 

There was so many wonderful sites that i saw and i felt that it was ruined by this.

solotravel,1fboz81,Advice needed: Is a one year trip something I can/should go for? ,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fboz81/advice_needed_is_a_one_year_trip_something_i/,23,"Hey! I'm here for advice from those who may have gone through similar situations. I'll give as much context as I can while trying to keep it short.

* ***Work background:***

I'm 31M, Spain. Currently working for a FAANG company for almost 5 years, and feeling completely burnt out due to many reasons. Namely, internal politics, bad management, lack of sense of purpose, bureaucracy, lack of career development opportunities (within my current department), not feeling valued etc. 

During the last June I've tried to interview for other job positions within the company, in another country, for a position I liked more. After 6 interviews, I was told I was successful and passed. But eventually due to some HR mismanagement they couldn't move me. I could try to go for another round of interviews, but at this point I feel so done with the whole situation. Other than being mentally checked out in my current department, I've put a huge effort in the interviews, having even been told I was successful, only to not materialize. 

*  ***Education background:***

Got a degree in pure maths back in my uni days. I've learned some coding on my own as well, which has been very helpful at work. I would hope all of that would play in favor when coming back, **if** I were to take a gap year. 

*  ***Financial background:***

I've been saving for a while, managing to save 90k€. No debt, no house, no expenses other than rent and everyday life.

* ***Travel background***

I've traveled around europe quite a lot in short periods of 2-3 weeks, as well as to Japan.

* ***Other background:***

Previously to doing the interviews in June, I was already considering taking the gap year and just go for a one year trip. In July I got a working holiday visa for Japan, with the intention of spending one year there (I've been twice and I'm always waiting for a chance to go back). I would also use it as a base to travel to other countries in south east asia. My second option for the gap year is to travel around the world instead (without a country base). My third option is to stay at home and do shorter trips, but focusing also on other personal things that I enjoy, here.

* ***Doubts*** 

Honestly I'm overthinking this. Japan's my first option (I need to land there no later than the 2nd week of October), but I do worry about what will happen when I come back home. I was expecting to spend 30k in Japan, and then, once I come back, I would have to find a new flat to rent, which would be *much* more expensive (my current rent can't be increased more than a small % due to gov. regulations). In principle I can get my current job back through preferential hire, some people have done that before and they managed fine, but this job makes me so miserable (yet it's way overpaid). 

  
I guess the elephant in the room is, why am I doing this? I sort of feel that going to Japan for one year, or going for a world trip for one year, or staying at home one year and traveling around here, any of those options feel like avoidance to me. I mean, if I didn't feel burnt out, I would have never considered doing this at this point of my life, so in a way I feel like I should instead power through and find a new job (it feels like the responsible thing to do), which would probably resolve most of what is causing my burnt out. I do not need to go on a one year trip, with all the consequences that I'd face when coming back, in order for me to feel better. In a way I'm feeling like I'd be taking the easy way out instead of facing reality and work to solve my problems, finding a new job and all. On the other hand, I'd love to actually do this (whichever of the 3 options I would end up doing), I guess in a way I'm too afraid of what will come next, and feeling like maybe I would be making a mistake. What if I'm tanking my career by doing this? 

  
Initially I was saving towards buying a house, but with the current market, it just seems so unlikely. I kind of have dropped this idea for the next 5 years or so. Despite saving as much, I'm nowhere near to be able to afford a house. I feel like going forward with this trip idea would be irresponsible as I'd eat up on my savings by quite a lot. 

  
What are the important questions I should ask myself that should help me decide on what to do? There are so many variables to this I am just not able to think straight, I go from ""oh this is a fantastic idea"" to ""I'm being totally delusional"", I go from feeling ""yolo"" to feeling irresponsible. I can't decide and I'm totally overthinking this for months, which is adding to the whole work stress situation. 

Maybe someone here has been through a similar situation. Honestly any sort of advice would really help me at this point. How are you supposed to take such a decision?",2024-09-08 03:51:29

Feel like I’ve just now figured out how to recover (4 months in) and thought I’d share/welcome anyone else to share tips. 

I think a couple months in it’s inevitable to feel the effects of full time travel - late nights in hostels w people snoring, early am flights, long bus rides, heat/humidity, loneliness, division fatigue, budget constraints, exhaustion etc. it sounds like such a first world problem (and it is), but it’s very real and I don’t often hear people talk about it in hostels. I started to feel like I was the only one feeling this way until checking out Reddit so wanted to help others as well.  

- it’s okay to not do everything. Pick and chose the ‘touristy must do’s’ in the areas you’re visiting. Decide what really matters to you. Occasionally say no to the nights out/drinking when you’re exhausted 
- splurge on a hotel or Airbnb for a couple nights in the city you’re in and stay put. Moving around gets taxing. Stay in your pajamas for a day and do literally nothing. Order takeout, some desserts, watch movies/Netflix and don’t do anything for the day
-FaceTime or call family / friends from back home. Great to talk to them and also serves as a little reminder of the typical 9-5 life you’re normally living 
- go to a cafe with a book or journal and just hang out for a while 
-make sure you’re nourished, hydrated, and have slept enough. It’s crazy how much any of these things can drastically affect your mood/energy levels if even a bit off. Remember traveling is taxing on your body and you need a break both physically and mentally (regardless if people in your hostels are resting) 

For me, it took extending my stay in one city for about 5 days total. Pretty much only went to the beach, sat at resteraunts, and cafes and laid in bed. Feeling much better now and excited to see all the sights again!",2024-09-08 14:22:11

solotravel,1fbk2hb,Itinerary help for a solo trip to Italy in January,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fbk2hb/itinerary_help_for_a_solo_trip_to_italy_in_january/,34,"I'm in the early stages of planning for an Italian tour during the winter. I've tried starting on my own, but honestly there's so much information out there online that it's a little overwhelming hahaha. I'd really appreciate if anyone has some ideas or suggestions for the trip.

**Some Basic Info:**

**Dates:** Jan. 22 (fly out from Shanghai on the 21st)- Feb. 8 I work in China and will be traveling for CNY so my dates are inflexible.

**Airports:** This is my biggest concern right now since I want to buy the tickets soon. My original plan was Shanghai - Rome roundtrip, but maybe a multi-city flight would be better? Based on the itinerary below I was thinking Shanghai-Rome and then Venice-Shanghai? Or maybe there's a better option I'm not seeing?  (I'll be flying with Qatar Airways for my avios)

**Interests:** History, Archeology, Eating.

**Musts:** Rome (+Vatican), Pompeii (I want to stay at least a full day, preferrably 2), Venice. 

**Wants:** Visit a cute little town or two just to eat some local food from grandma. Just get out of the tourist centers for a night or two. San Marino because visiting microstates is fun.

**Would like:** Generally I'd like to visit a neighboring country, but I imagine the hassle might not be worth it? From the neighboring countries, Switzerland is probably at the top of the list because I like cheese, chocolate, and mountains. Not too interested in skiiing or snowboarding, but I've seen pictures of the Alps and they don't look real.

**Transportation:** Public. I like buses and trains. I don't want to take cars or taxis unless I must. Can't drive so no way to rent a car.

**Energy Levels:** I'd probably put myself in around the upper middle with energy levels. I like walking though I don't necessarily like doing super sporty things on holidays (especially skiing/snowboarding since I don't really like it lol). I want to have a few afternoons with nothing particular to do, just hanging out or enjoying a snack somewhere.

Here's what I've kind of come up with. This is mostly just to outline which nights I would stay in each city/town.

**Jan. 22- Rome.** Arrive in Rome. Find hotel, rest, get some food maybe.

**Jan. 23-28- Rome + Vatican.** Do some tours, visit the Colosseum, Roman forums, some day trips around the outskirts, etc.

**Jan. 29-Feb. 1- Naples and Pompeii.** Honestly, I'm really interested in archeological sites and I understand that Pompeii is really big. Maybe I'd want to spend even more time there? I know I don't have unlimited time though... I know I definitely want to stay at least one night at/near the archeological site itself, since I don't want to deal with heading back to my hotel in Naples after spending all day walking around outside in the cold.

**Feb. 2-Feb. 3- San Marino.** Is it really on the way to Venice from Naples or does it just look like that? I just think it'd be funny to spend a night in San Marino.

**Feb. 3-Feb. 6- Venice.** Enjoy the lake and visit some museums. I think maybe 3 days is too long for Venice? 

**Feb. 7- Rome.** Train back to Rome, fly back the next day.

I know this itinerary would work, but I think I may be spending too much time in Rome? How/when would you fit in a visit to Switzerland or another neighboring country? I was thinking speed it up a bit and after Venice make a quick stop to Switzerland before heading back south to Rome?

Can someone check my Romania itinerary and tell me what you think?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fbelx4/hi_everyone_can_someone_check_my_romania/,1,"Hi everyone!! Thoughts on this Romania itinerary? Sept 12-19 I enjoy driving a lot so I don’t mind spending hours in a car. I live in California so driving from San Diego to San Francisco is usually an 11hr trip I have done multiple times.

Flight lands morning September 12 at 6:35pm, so rough plan is:

* Thu 9/12: get car rental, check in hotel, get dinner somewhere in Bucharest and just rest for drive the next day
* Fri 9/13: Drive to Săpânța I’d like to go through the Transfăgărășan but I don’t know if it’ll be open. I’ll have to check. I’ll try to do some sightseeing along the road, plan is to get to Săpânța by 6-7pm
* Sat 9/14: Săpânța Merry Cemetery, Barsana Monastery, maybe some hiking. I like the rural areas since I grew up in rural Mexico.
* Sun 9/15: early drive to Cluj Napoca Get breakfast in Cluj Napoca then drive to Sighișoara in the evening and spend the night there.
* Mon 9/16: Explore Sighișoara. I haven’t decided if I want to spend the night in Sighișoara again. It’d be nice to rest but also, I could leave in the evening and spend the night in Brasov. (Am I missing out on Sibiu?)
* Tue 9/17: Brasov Peles Castle (I have seen all the posts about it being boring and a tourist scam but I want to go anyway) Any other recommendations in the area?
* Wed 9/18: Bucharest I know that one day is not enough to explore a city like Bucharest, but I am more of a rural village, small city kind of guy…

I’ve seen some car rentals charging like $7 a day… how legit is this? I also have an international driver’s license. Do I need it? Nobody cared in Bulgaria and Scotland.",2024-09-07 19:09:05

I've enjoyed my travels so far and wanna take this leap to do a long trip, but the thing holding me back is that I've got my bf and we'd be doing long distance. Being away from family is going to be hard, but not as hard as being away from my bf since I already moved across the country for university and see my family 3 times/year; but my bf - we spend like every day together that we can and are both super attached and clingy lol so I'm getting sad at the thought of going into a LDR. But on the other hand, I'm super burnt out and I'm never gonna get another chance to go travel for 4 months once I graduate and start working full time. I guess I'm just not sure how I'd react once I'm there and miss my bf so can someone please hype me up to go on this trip? Or is it a stupid decision to leave him behind for this?

Going on my first (kind of) solo trip next month. (My dad is staying in the same hotel but we have completely different things planned and will likely spend most of the hotel separate as we have separate rooms too!). I have researched the hotel and lots of people have advised that the TV’s do not have many English channels. I’m a massive fan of background noise, especially on my own, and am considering taking my iPad with me to use for TV/Music whilst getting ready and in the evenings when I’m alone. My only problem is I don’t particularly want to fork out the 15 euros for the safe because my Dad will insist on keeping everything important with him in his room anyways (passports etc). 

Do you think taking my iPad with me is a bad idea? Will it be safe for me to just shove it in my luggage when I’m not in the room instead of paying for the safe? Would love some advice!

I’m going to Puerto De La Cruz in Tenerife! ",2024-09-07 19:24:21

solotravel,1fastbr,Short trip to Peru at the end of the month,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fastbr/short_trip_to_peru_at_the_end_of_the_month/,29,"I’m taking a trip to Peru for 8 days and I was wondering about a couple different ways of doing it. I know 8 days is not a long time, unfortunately telling me it’s not enough won’t change my plane ticket. 

I fly in and out of Lima and initially I was planning to go by bus. But then I had to keep cutting activities out, and then I was left with several very long bus rides. The ultimate goal is Cusco to do Rainbow Mountain and Machu Picchu.

I looked up flights from Lima to Cusco and they seem to be less than $100 usd round trip. So my new thought is to to Lima, Cusco, Rainbow Mountain, Machu Picchu (maybe 2 days), and Huacachina if I have time.

I would prefer to travel by bus and spend more time around the country, but unfortunately I don’t have the time. My main question is: how does this lineup seem? Am I missing something? Any general info or tips would be very appreciated. Will be staying in hostels. Fluent in Spanish and mostly interested in outdoor activities and hikes while I’m down there.

Thanks in advance!

****UPDATE****

Thanks to everyone that commented. I took a lot of the advice I read here and had a great trip! If anyone has something similar coming up I've typed up my itinerary and a few general notes.

Day 1 - Arrived in Lima in the afternoon. Coordinating with Uber was a bit more complicated than taxi, because they needed to go through a ticketing system, but still worth it for the cheaper price (alternative was taxi). Stayed at a hostel near the airport. Got a SIM card and charged up more than I’d need for the week with 25 Soles.

Day 2 - Back to the airport for a midday flight to Cusco. Spent the day walking around getting acclimatized. Had some cuy and other food/drink at a festival. For several days I had an on and off headache, shorter breath, and was dizzy when moved too fast. However the altitude didn’t prevent me from doing anything in a packed 8 days (I also planned it not to be too brutal at the start)

Day 3 - 4:00 am wakeup time for a tour of the Sacred Valley which was interesting and well worth the 130 Soles. Paying extra for the salt mines is worth it. You need to buy a ticket which covers the other stops for the day, but if you want to see any other sites you need to buy the complete ticket (130 soles, or 70 with student ID). Left the tour in Ollantaytambo (missed one stop but prevented an extra 4 hours of bus riding to go back to Cusco just to take a van back to Ollantaytambo). This was well worth it. Inca Rail and Peru Rail do the same thing, I picked based on cheapest options. Got into Aguas Calientes around 7:00 pm. Little tip to look for your name on the boards of people standing there for arrivals. I wasn’t contacted by my hotel, but they still came to look for me. So I beat the owner back. Stayed at a no frills, good location hotel for ~180 Soles. Really great service and helped me with Machu Picchu tickets and entry since they changed the circuit system in August. Got a ticket for the bus which was well worth even the $12 one way. On the way back you could walk down, but it would still take 2 hours on a dirt road with busses constantly running. 

Day 4 - Had a 7:00 am entrance time to MP, was in line for the bus by 5:45 and there were already about 100 people in front of me. Had Circuit 1 with MP and was solo so I didn’t want to pay for a private tour. I also really wanted to do the mountain first (you have the option to do mountain or circuit first) but that results in no tour guide when doing the circuit. So MP circuit itself was a little underwhelming. I mean, good pics but without a guide you can easily get through in 20-30 mins not 2 hours. MP mountain was absolutely worth it. You can only enter until noon and they allow 200 people/day. I started at 7:20. Took me about 1:15 to get to the top and I was the second of the day to summit. By the time I was going down around 9 there were wayyy more people on the way up and the rocks were getting hotter. My trip to MP was incredible mostly because I did the mountain and I did it early. By the time I got down to the entrance, everything was like a zoo. Took the bus back, grabbed lunch in AC before doing bimodal (pretty seamless) back to Cusco. AC also had some kind of founders day celebration and parade the one day I was there and on the way back the train opened our car to the premium car which only had one guy in it. So a couple of bonuses!

Day 5 - Spent the night in Cusco in the same hostel as before (because I left a suitcase there). I went on the advice of someone in this post and took an Uber to Tambomachay. From there I walked to Puka Pukara (very close), Qenco (about another hour's walk down the road you come up), Saqsaywaman (not far from Qenco). I would highly recommend this if you are on a budget but still have the complete ticket. Getting a driver to take you around to these places would be 130 Soles and a tour would be comparable or more, but with explanation. I also would NOT do this in reverse. I saw people just trying to walk up to Saqsaywaman from Cusco and they were already struggling.

Day 6 - Got up at 3:30 for a tour with the same company as Sacred Valley for a hike. I initially wanted to do Rainbow Mountain, but it turns out there are several Rainbow Mountains, and the popular one is totally overrun with tourists and just not all that nice anymore (according to people I talked to in Cusco) so they suggested Palcoyo instead. Slightly lower in elevation, but not really anything noticeable. More wildlife. Seemed like the better option. I was happy with the experience but it was snowing when we got to the top so I really only saw one color. Drive up is incredible.

Day 7 - A pretty heavy travel day. I had one more complete day and had left it open to either a day trip to Huacachina from Lima or just rest in Lima. I figured go all out. So after my flight in the am was canceled and then delayed I got into Lima around 1:00 pm. I took a 45 minute Uber to a bus station in La Victoria and non-express bus to Ica which took 6 hours. From Ica I got a taxi to Huacachina for 10 Soles (they like to charge up to 15-20). Spent the night in the Oasis for a total of about 13 hours of travel.

Day 8 - Spent the day at the hostel and walking around Huacachina. I did an excellent sand ski tour in the afternoon (they all start around 3:30 pm if you don’t do private). Took a shower, grabbed dinner, and took a bus from Ica back to Lima around 8:30. This one was double the price but didn’t stop and was much more comfortable (30 Soles vs 65).

General notes

Getting set up with a SIM is worth it imo for so much travelling on a short timetable

For MP I booked everything individually in the cheapest way I could see. I spent 215 Soles on the train from Ollantaytambo to AC. Accommodation was ~180. Meals are expensive around 40-70. MP ticket was 120 through the official government website (Circuit 1 + MP Mtn. with student discount). Another $24 USD for the bus up and down MP. Did not pay for a guide. Around 560 Soles for bimodal back to Cusco from AC. So including accommodation and 2 meals (most hotels give a bag lunch for MP) my trip to MP all included cost a little over 300 USD. Keeping in mind this is with overnight charges and the added step of figuring things out on your own, you can decide if it’s worth it to do everything separately or pay a bit of a premium for a tour company to figure it out for you.

I’m thrilled with the amount I was able to pack into a week. Highly recommend this or a similar itinerary if you want to see as much as you can, it did not leave a lot of time for rest.

Latam between Cusco and Lima seems to have a lot of delays and flight cancellations

Dry season is ending now, so Lima is covered in dust and dirt. It’s a huge city and I didn’t spend a lot of time there, but it seems uninspiring for more than a day or two visit.

Only bottled water, even for brushing teeth. Go off script at your own risk. Bottled still tastes terrible

If you know where to go 100% alpaca wool clothes are well worth it. Not for the price the tourist stores sell it for. There are outlets dotted around Cusco that sell authentic Alpaca without the tourist frills for about ⅓ the price (still 280 Soles for a baby alpaca sweater). The challenge is finding one. Baby alpaca doesn’t come from a baby alpaca.

Happy to add in any links for companies or hostels I used, just want to get this info out first. Honestly, Peru is such a touristy area in general if something has good reviews and is in a good location, it’s probably a good option.

Food is delicious and a wide variety of gastronomy. I tried to eat something new every meal. However, the altitude probably affected my appetite more than anything else. And my sleep.

solotravel,1fas36z,Habits from home: helpful or harmful for homesickness?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1fas36z/habits_from_home_helpful_or_harmful_for/,16,"Hi all,

I’m feeling really homesick this trip, in which I made a point to stick to some of my favourite habits from home, and now I’m wondering whether it’s helpful or harmful.

I’m almost a month into my 3 month Argentina and Chile trip, and I’m having the time of my life. Everything is going far better than expected - I can (surprisingly!) speak and understand Spanish, the sights are unreal, the food is awesome, and I’m under budget. Really, couldn’t be better.

However, I am increasingly finding myself homesick. I am enamoured with my life back home - in fact, that’s the very reason I set out in the first place! - and this trip, I made it a point to keep doing some of my favourite habits from home.

For example, I am a philosophy student, I am learning Japanese, I am studying the piano and I love classical music - so I read some philosophy, at least once every few days, practice my Japanese a few minutes a day, practice sight reading (couldn’t bring my piano with me…), and listen to my favourite classical pieces on occasion.

My homesickness is completely irrational: I know for sure I’m not missing anything at home (everyone is away for the summer), and that travelling was the right decision - I’m growing so much here. I do not want or plan to come back before my trip ends (I have a flight home already). And yet, I feel the pangs of homesickness, and they are getting stronger.

Now I’m wondering whether sticking to my habits from home is helping my homesickness, or causing it. For example, I’ve had seriously great time reading philosophy in the park with a beer, much like I do at home, but also find myself longing for home when practicing Japanese on downtime, as I usually do.

And so, I turn to you. What do you think - does sticking with habits from home help with homesickness, or aggravate it? What do you do on your travels?

Thanks!

UPDATE: After putting a lot of thought and practice into this, I think I found my solution. 

I think, for me, the key is whether you are connecting to or disconnecting from your trip with your habit. I'll explain. 

Suppose I find myself with free time on a nice weekend day. At home, I would use it to read. While travelling I discovered that, if I go someplace nice - like a park or nature reserve or the city square, and read there, I feel great. But if I read that very same book in bed at the hostel, I feel worse. Because in one instance, I'm doing what everyone else does - when it's a nice day, local people go outside and enjoy themselves - and in the other, I am retreating into a ""safe"" space. 

Even for stuff like cooking, which I love, I found it brings me great joy when I use local ingredients and cook a local dish, or at least add a twist to something I know from home, but really brings me down when I cook some dish from home. 

I guess what I am trying to say is, for me, context is king. If I do stuff with the stated intent of recharging, it falls flat on the face and I feel worse. But if I do the very same things as a part of my travel - even mundane stuff like doomscrolling while waiting for the bus - I feel much better. 

I've started applying this mindset to my home habits over the last weeks, and my homesickness pangs have greatly eased. I hope this helps anyone else reading this :)",2024-09-06 22:37:10

My last solo travel was to Japan, i joined some day tour activities there, there are so many people joining as well, but i can see they are in groups, just me solo. It was okay when the activities are within 15 people, cuz when u talked to some people even they are with friends, they are still willing to talk to you. But one time there were about 20-30 people, the whole group was moving on to some spots, i tried to talk to the people next to me, and they just ignored me like i wasn't existed...

solotravel,1falxr1,Budapest vs Prague for weekend,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1falxr1/budapest_vs_prague_for_weekend/,4,"Prague and Budapest are the two primary cities I want to see but also would like to see Bratislava. I'm basing this trip around a work trip. I'm coming from the US and I'd like to spend the weekend in either Budapest or Prague. So trip structure is the question. I was going to flip a coin but I decided to let reddit decide. 

**So my big questions:**   
Would you spend a weekend in Budapest or Prague if you were going to see both?  
When would you stop in Bratislava?

  
My last post got flagged for low effort so here is some more info about my situation.

**Constraints:** I have to fly into Prague and I have to end up in Istanbul (the following weekend by Saturday or Sunday the latest). Flights out of Vienna seem like the best choice to get there from this area.

**Budget:** I'm not overly concerned about the Budget for accommodations as there are many place to stay that will be well within the budget (trying to keep it to under $100/night which is very doable, around $50 seems possible and would be great)

**Some background:**

- 33M going to Central Europe for about a week in October. (I've also been to Vienna a couple times before and my goal is to see some other cities, just wanted to say that before the suggestion comes up because Vienna is super cool and I know someone will suggest to spend more time there)

- I currently fly into Prague and land on a Friday first thing in the morning. This would be making it an 8 day trip ( I can change the dates just not the location). I can land as early as Tuesday/Wednesday that week to make it a 10ish day trip. Landing earlier would make the most sense to me if I wanted to be in Budapest for a weekend. It would also seem like a disservice to Prague to land Wednesday morning and take a Thursday night train as I would not want to take a Friday night train.

  
**Time:**  
8 day or 11 day trip (8 day is weekend in Prague, 11 day is weekend in Budapest and extra couple days in Istanbul).

**My current 8 day plan:**   
Visit Prague for about 3 days (Friday-Sunday)

Overnight train to Budapest (Sunday Night)

See Budapest for about 3 days (Monday-Wednesday)

Train up to Bratislava and fly out of Vienna (Thursday)

Fly to Istanbul (Friday)

\*\*would you stop in Bratislava on the way from Prague and Fly out of Budapest?\*\*

**My Current 11 day plan** (Makes sense to spend 3 days in Prague vs 4 because night train Friday night? Don't think that's a good move but can be convinced otherwise)  
Visit Prague for about 3 days (Tuesday-Thursday)

Overnight train to Budapest (Thursday Night)

See Budapest for about 4 days (Friday-Monday)

Train up to Bratislava and fly out of Vienna (Late Monday/ EarlyTuesday)

Fly to Istanbul (Wednesday/Thursday)

I abruptly quit my job and had another lined up a month later, so I literally bought a plane ticket and was in Japan 2 weeks later. Had no plans, just wandered the country for 17 days and enjoyed myself so much. Didn’t even book hotels until the night before I got to the next city. It was AWESOME. 

My next bucket list country is New Zealand. I booked plane tickets a few months ago and will be there for close to 3 weeks. I leave in November. 

I am terrified to go to New Zealand. I don’t know why. I’m at the point where I want to cancel everything, the plane tickets and the car rental. Maybe it’s because I have to drive on the other side of the road (I’m from the US)? The great thing about Japan was the trains…otherwise I don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve been on multiple solo trips in the US and Canada as well where I had to drive.

I (26M, UK) am planning to head to Central America at the end of the year (2-2.5 weeks). I’ve narrowed the options down to Guatemala and Nicaragua.

I speak a very good level of Spanish, have experience travelling other countries in the region as well as some more “dangerous” countries elsewhere. Having spoken to friends who have travelled both countries, I am really struggling to make the decision on where to go to. Flights cost the same more or less and have similar travel time.

What’s important to me:
- Outdoorsy activities - both countries appeal massively here
- Partying - I’ll be here for NYE and want to visit areas with good nightlife scenes and I imagine I will want to party at least every other night 
- Hostels - on a similar note to above, I want to visit places with busy (party?) hostels where I can easily meet other people 
- Distances - I don’t mind travelling longer distances but ideally won’t be spending the majority of the trip on coaches/buses

For Nicaragua I am largely eyeing up the west coast and for Guate I imagine I would be doing the standard trail (Antigua, Lago Atitlan and 2/3 of Flores/Tikal, Semuc Champey and El Paredón).

Given my spec, does anyone have any recommendations on which country would be best suited to my interests? Does anyone have particularly strong opinions about which country would be best and most fun to visit during this period?

Around 2 weeks in each place, i want to be flexible but also plan so i don’t miss out. 

I want to start in vietnam I was thinking Hanoi, I want to do the 4 day Ha Giang loop, I also want to visit Phong nha and Hoi an. Then I wanted to go to the philippines and see Moalboal, el nido, cebu and possibly siargao if possible. 

My budget is 5k so I plan on doing a mix of hotels and hostels, buses and planes to save time. 

I’m taking a sleeper bus to Ha giang for the loop and then another one back to Hanoi so I can fly to Da nang to get to hoi an. 

Then another bus for around 7 hours to phong nha and then the dong hoi airport to Cebu. 

Is that too many buses? I plan on this taking 17-18 days. Should I plan on seeing more places?

I don’t want my trip to be too rushed because i’d like to enjoy it. Some nights I want to stay in a nice hotel and visit a spa or something like that. 

For the philippines-

After a couple days in Cebu I was thinking Id fly to Coron (not sure if i should stay here a couple days or move on to the tour?) and do a 3 day boat tour to el nido.

I haven't booked any accommodation yet so I'm open for recommendations.

Day 1 - Friday 13th September - Amman

I should arrive into Amman airport at 10:15am. I've decided to rent a car for the trip so I will be collecting the car and driving to the hostel. I plan to spend the first day exploring Amman.

Day 2 - Saturday 14th September - Jerash/Dead Sea/Petra?

So this days plan is where I would like any advice. At the moment I plan to start the day early and drive up to Jerash and see the ruins. After this I would like to drive to the dead sea. Should I get a day pass at a resort? How long do you recommend at each place? I plan to drive to Petra before the end of the night and rest there.

Day 3 - Sunday 15th September - Petra

The plan for this day is the typical touristy day at Petra. Getting the walking boots on and taking in all the sights. I plan to spend this night in Petra too.

Day 4 - Monday 16th September - Wadi Rum

Drive from Petra to Wadi Rum and stay at one of the campsites. I haven't booked a camp/guide/jeep tour or anything yet so again if you have a recommendation I would love to know.

Day 5 - Tuesday 17th September - Aqaba

Drive to Aqaba from Wadi Rum. It would be my last full day in Jordan so I don't mind just having a chill beach day and going with the flow. Is there anything I should do/visit?

Day 6 - Wednesday 18th September - Goodbye Jordan

My flight is at 10:15am from Aqaba airport so I'll be heading to the airport and returning the car.",2024-09-05 23:11:17

This sub has helped me a lot over the last 18 months or so, so I wanted to briefly share my experience/thoughts. 

I (28 M) moved to the UK last year and decided to travel solo for a couple months through East & South East Asia en route. I started in Japan, after a few days/honeymoon period I realised that this was going to be a lot tougher than I had thought.

I hadn’t quite understood how difficult it was for me to fill up my time without being at home, or having other people around. I also hadn’t appreciated how much time you have to think when you are travelling alone and I didn't quite understand the social aspect of meeting people at hostels (still struggle with this often!).

It was a big learning curve which I eventually got used to and had an enjoyable time over the next few months, although it was still peppered with times of loneliness and wanting to go home. But overall, I'm very happy with, and proud of the experience. 

Ever since then, I have been doing a series of solo trips and trips with friends through Europe. Most recently a trip to the Baltic, 1 week with friends, 1 week solo. However, I’ve been quite stressed recently (work and issues with my flat), this, in conjunction with leaving my friends led me to become quite lonely. I ended up overthinking too much and coming home early.

I feel like a bit of a failure, even though I said to myself if I do go home, I can’t be too hard on myself.  So now I’m just at home waiting for Monday to roll around so I can get back to work lol. I do feel a bit worried that it might happen again next time I decide to travel solo but I think that this is a lessons learnt in terms of having external factors influencing my ability to enjoy solo travelling.  

Not sure what I’m expecting from you all (if anything) but I just wanted to share. This won’t be the end of my solo travel journey, just a bump in the road!",2024-09-05 14:59:27

I'm 32F and from the UK. I am considering planning a solo trip to the USA around the Autumn time of next year (end of October / beginning of November). 

The two places I have in mind are very different: Boston and San Francisco. I realise they are at complete opposite ends of the US. I have Boston in mind because it looks so beautiful and seems a  relatively easy city to navigate on foot. I don't drive so therefore would be completely relying on public transport or walking. However, going to California has been a dream of mine since I was very young.

I feel SF would be the more difficult option without a car but am I correct there would be guided coach tours/day trips to places like Yosemite National Park or Los Angeles? It seems public transport is much more hit and miss in the US than it is here in the UK, understandably with the US being so huge. I'm happy to join a day trip guided tour if its feasible. 

The sort of holiday I'd be looking for is relaxes wandering and absorbing the sights, eating lots of nice food, and beautiful scenery. So basically, a very chilled holiday. I would like to stay in hotels rather than hostels. 

I'm not great with bad weather, especially heavy wind and rain. I'm not too bad with the cold, though I dislike extreme heat and muggy weather.

I'd just like some advice on what would be the better option for someone who has never visited the US before and a lone female traveller who does not drive. I would say my budget is around £3000 (I am unsure of the equivalent in dollars), and I plan to go for 10 days.

solotravel,1f8tnkw,Backpacking Uganda ,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f8tnkw/backpacking_uganda/,102,"Not much out there info wise for solo backpacking in Uganda or Africa in general so thought I’d give my 2 cents. 

Firstly, Uganda is super underrated, safe (all relative + just my anecdotal), the people are so so nice and friendly, and it’s cheap!!!
Also Africa is so not a common backpacker destination (my experience) and I’m now an advocate. Just prepare to make friends with more locals than other travellers :))  

- So just over 5 weeks I only spent $1500 AUD ($1000 USD). Not including seeing the mountain gorillas (another $800 USD I booked it 6 months prior). Most people spend $8k US+ cor just a 12 days tour of Uganda. Organising it yourself takes more effort and patience for sure but worth it to my cheap ass.  
Did lots from teaching in a school to hiking in the jungle of Rwenzori mountains to seeing hippos, elephants, hyenas a metre outside my tent, seeing chimpanzees, countless chameleons, pangolins, meeting the Pygmy tribes of Bwindi rainforest and so much more. Well worth the visit. (Also gorillas ofc but that’s a bougie side mission $$)

- Super easy to get around if you’re happy moving like a local, squashed into minivans, hot stinky buses, getting a sore bum on a motorbike taxi etc. 

- Cheaper to enter National Parks than lots of neighbouring African countries like Kenya Tanzania etc.  usually $40 USD per day compared to $70-100

- most undeveloped and poor country I’ve been to. Be prepared for that. Far more than Kenya or India. (Again, my observation.)

- local food (IMO)… not a tremendous culinary experience. 
Well it is, but in the sense that you’ll never appreciate a burger or a curry more than you will after a few weeks of eating with locals. 

I know some people are going solely for the gorillas and it is the best place in the world to see them. (Safer than Congo and cheaper than Rwanda) so I’ll make another post from what I’ve found as to how to do it (genuinely as cheap as physically possible not just “budget” that cost $2k 🧐

Africas so cheap until you want to do safaris, then because the vast majority of people going spend crazy $$$, they’ve made everything crazy expensive. but there’s still ways to make it somewhat affordable. 

Go to Africa as a backpacker, get uncomfortably close to some of the craziest wildlife and culture in the world, get uncomfortable in general, you won’t forget it!! ",2024-09-04 13:42:11

Trip Length: 5 days

Destination(s): London

Accommodation: An airbnb in Clapham/Battersea

Activities: Some partying, lots of food eating, saw a spurs game, AEW All In, went to Carnival, had a tinder lunch date

What Went Right: The whole trip pretty much. I was super nervous going on my first vacation of any kind alone. I met people pretty much every day I was there. I even went on a tinder date. 

What Went Wrong: I didn't think to pay extra to reserve my airplane seat for the way there... so of course I got the middle seat. It was a redeye so i slept for maybe an hour... around 3am someone opened their window and it was bright as hell outside, I gave up sleeping at that point. 

I should have paid for the international phone plan while out there. My phone was molasses slow the whole trip because it was on roaming. Didn't realize I could do that until the last day. 

Mobile passport/Global Entry is a must. After an 8 hour flight all I wanted to do was go home, but I still had to wait through a ridiculously long line at JFK to go through customs. I was overwhlemed by how long it was. 

I needed to embrace tourism. I pretty much avoided everything touristy while there... and even stayed in an airbnb away from everything touristy... but in the end, I ended up hanging out the most with other Americans. In the end, they have similar interests to me, so they would be 1000x more down to explore. 

Recommendations: Tayaabs for Indian. Poppies for fish and chips... pretty much everywhere has fish and chips, but the one in Soho isn't far from Big Ben. Soho seemed to me like it was London's version of Times Square. All of the greasy spoons that I went to were good! 

I loved Brixton. The Chip Shop had the hip hop that I'm into. It's right by Brixton village which has great food and great ambience as well. 

I did do a night drinking in Shoreditch and that was fun as well. It was very young professional. If you're from NYC it reminded me of the meatpacking district. Also, a lot of the bars are open past midnight in this area... which isn't the norm in London. 

If you want to see a premier league game in London, be warned that it isn't like here where you just buy a ticket and go. To see a Spurs game, I had to buy a membership for 50 pounds and THEN buy a ticket. The membership came with some free beers, a discount on merch and a tour of the stadium (I didn't have time for the tour). I'm told all of the Premier League teams require a membership to go to games. 

Final Verdict: An incredible time!",2024-09-04 22:26:17

I'm a shoulder season traveler, so I really prefer March or early April. I think that may eliminate some far north towns in Scotland?

Does anyone have any favorite scenic U.K. villages or towns they love to spend quiet time in?",2024-09-04 18:00:39
solotravel,1f9fw77,Group Travel Tours ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f9fw77/group_travel_tours/,20,"Hello fellow travellers! 

I 23F am planning a vacation for sometime in Mid-November because I’ll finally have time off from work. I have some travel experience with family and friends but so far have only done one international solo trip - to NYC. 

I’m finding it difficult to find travel companions at this stage of my life due to different financial circumstances, time constraints, etc. However, I don’t want that to stop me from travelling and seeing the world. 

Given that I am inexperienced with solo travel, I am considering a group tour as a way to get my feet wet. I understand that you pay a premium to travel as part of these tours, and that you aren’t in control of your schedule, but I value the convenience of having my itinerary planned out.

Does anyone have experience with group travel tours? I’ve looked into G adventures, EF ultimate break, and Intrepid, but am highly considering Contiki solely because the dates available align with my time off and I would be booking last minute-ish. 

I’ve heard lots about how your experience can vary widely depending on who’s on the tour. I would consider myself to be social but quite introverted at times, and I do not drink whatsoever. One of my concerns is the potential isolation because of this? The idea of meeting new people from all over the world excites me, but I’m really not interested in being stuck with a bunch of 18 year olds looking to get blackout drunk every night (I’ve heard that this has been some peoples experience)

If you have done any group tours but more specifically the Spain/Portugal trip through Contiki, please share your experience - pros/cons! Also, I would love to hear about the demographics of the group as this is something that can change the dynamic of the tour, and I’m a little bit nervous being a WOC. 

Thanks in advance! :)",2024-09-05 06:37:02

solotravel,1f9bqqd,Cambodia + Vietnam 6 weeks - how far in advance to book things?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f9bqqd/cambodia_vietnam_6_weeks_how_far_in_advance_to/,9,"I know variations of this have been asked before, I'm hoping for advice specific to the region, time of year and current travel climate. 

I'll be travelling late October through November.

I've always travelled for <2 weeks before so I've organised everything in advance and not had any flexibility. I'm a bit of a type A trip planner as it's just how I channel my excitement and anxiety but I'm aware it's probably not the best strategy. I've booked my main return flight and first two nights in Hanoi but nothing else so far.

I'd say I have a medium budget, of $2500AUD excluding the main flights I've already paid for. I'll be staying in hostels/home stays with the occasional hotel when I need to recharge.

The main things I'm wondering about are:

- Good/popular hostels and homestays, I've saved a few that I really like the look of and I'm concerned about them selling out in smaller places. I guess I could book with free cancellation and then change. Are there any locations where it's advisable to book early?

- Tours and experiences eg. Ha Giang loop, especially if I have a particular company in mind

- Internal flights - do the prices for these go up much closer to the date? There are 1 or 2 routes I'd prefer to fly rather than get a 15+ hr bus as long as it's <100aud.

- Trains and buses - I will be wanting to pay the slight extra for 1st class/VIP buses. I've seen advice to book these through hostels, is this better than booking myself via 12go etc?

I don't think November is peak time, but I'm also mostly hitting popular tourist spots so expect things to still be busy. I'll also want a bit of flexibility for the weather.

Would love to hear people's experiences and approaches and whether anything backfired in any way or worked out particularly well!

Thank you :)

Just for detail my general route will be: North Vietnam (Hanoi, Ha Giang, surrounding locations), maybe a stop in hoi an/da nang if weather permits, HCMC + Dalat + another location in South if time, then Cambodia (Phnom penh, siem reap, koh rong, kampot). Fly out of HCMC.",2024-09-05 02:33:06
solotravel,1f9byef,Italy-Worldpackers Trip Report ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f9byef/italyworldpackers_trip_report/,2,"Hi everyone!

I think it's a little bit late, but I still want to share with you about my 1-month trip in Italy I did in March and hope to give some useful info to anyone who is interested in Worldpackers. I also hope it can be helpful for the introverts out there, I found out here that some of us introverts can struggle with solo traveling and find it challenging.

I'm a Latin guy (26 M), quite introvert, who has never stayed in an hostel or shared dorm before, and technically speaking has solo travelled before but mainly for short work-related trips, wanted to try a proper first solo travel.

**Summary**
-10 cities, 2 countries
-40 days

First, as a Latin, I was a little bit concerned about how safe Worldpackers could be (because you're literally staying with strangers), so what I did was to filter all options to Hostels and then verify how good the hostel was on TripAdvisor or Google. The Worldpackers process was quite simple, I got approved for a hostel in Italy, made some interviews and then the hostel confirmed my stay, and so my trip begins.

**Milan**

I stayed the first two days at Yellowsquare Hostel. I was adviced by the guys at the Worldpackers hostel to not bring an umbrella because it doesn't rain too much in Italy, that just a raincoat would be fine. Terrible mistake haha, I arrived totally wet at the hostel reception like I just came out of a pool.

I stayed at a 4-bed mixed dorm, it was nice but I didn't get to know anyone in the dorm because every time I was in it there was no one else, except for a guy who I just stumbled upon the first day.

During the evening, went to the OC Terme Milano (yes, the popular TikTok spa with the ""rain room""), which was cool but I wouldn't recommend it for solo travellers, because everyone there is with their couples or friends, there's even an Aperitivo and you're sitting alone in a table in a room full of people and you might feel weird. At night I made some friends while playing a pub quiz on the hostel.

Next day I (rushed) did most of the major things in Milan, The Duomo , Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, Starbucks Reserve, Castello Sforzesco, Porta Nuova, etc. At night I hanged out in the hostel lobby with the guys I met last night and some new friends we made while playing beer pong.

**Florence & Siena**

Next day I finally arrived at Ostello Bello Florence where I was about to stay for the next month, and it was a amazing experience for first time volunteering and solo travelling!!

The staff was cool and friendly, the task were not too hard and cool most of the times, and I get to know so many people and friends that I was impressed because of how introvert I thought I was.

I'm amazed by how social hostels can be! The first night I nervously sat on a table to chat with some guys hanging out in the common area, worried to be a weird outsider and disturb their vibe, and just couple of hours later I was going out with them for dinner, and later on we were hanging out in the street outside the hostel having a philosophical late-night talk about why were we travelling.

Almost all the month I was making friends with the people staying at the hostel, hanged out with them and explore the city, a innumerous amount of Karaoke nights, travelled to Siena with some random guys that we didn't know each other but we became friends at the hostel, and I went so many times to Piazza Michelangelo and just chill out during sunset while eating a gelato. The museums, art and history of the city is also stunning and mesmerising!

After my volunteering in Florence, I took a couple of days to day-trip some towns in Italy. I'd love to go to Cinque Terre or Positano, but since it was late-winter the weather was cloudy most of the time so I thought it wouldn't worth the trip.

**Verona & Bologna**

Verona was nice (and sunny!), sadly I stayed just half a day and nothing was open early except for a really cool public library in downtown with frescoes on the ceilings (but at this point I thought almost all buildings in Italy had frescoes haha). I saw the Arena from the outside because it was closed,  went to Juliet's house (and even paid for the museum ticket) and just walk around the picturesque streets.

Bologna was quite interesting. I arrived to the town during sunset and I was a little bit worried about the surrounding because it seemed like a dangerous town to be outside during night because of the graffiti, but luckily it was not the case.

Sadly I caught a cold and sore throat and I tried to look out for a pharmacy to buy some meds during the night, I was lucky to find a pharmacy but I was politely yelled and kicked out because they were closing and I couldn't make my mind about what I needed to buy. Next morning I finally was able to buy some antibiotics, I was worried to not be able to get medicine without a EU prescription but it's cool that you can get medicine for simple sicknesses without having to pay a lot for a doctor.

The rest of the day in Bologna I took a free walking tour (spoiler: they are NOT free) and explore the city, later I went to an amazing restaurant: **Trattoria Trebbi**, and finally tried the BEST lasagna I've ever tried!! Although I was shocked to find out that traditional Bolognese lasagna is made with ""green pasta"", I don't know why, but it was amazing!

**Vicenza & Trento**

Next day I stay half a day in Vicenza because it was a stop for my trip to Trento. I didn't know anything about Vicenza (neither any Italian friend I asked), but I was so lucky to find out Monica from @sentieri_arte_architettura on Instagram, an expert architect that tells you about Palladio and guides you around the city and the milestone it was for the global architecture history (she was shocked about Italians telling me they didn't know Vicenza haha).

What I also loved about Vicenza it's that it's not full of tourists (nor people), so it feels quite more authentic and traditional, and it's quite peaceful to just walk around during the sunset.

Later on I arrived to Trento, it was so cool to go to the mountains and see the snow! I was luck to stay in a hotel where you can get a Free Transport Pass, so I took a bus for free to go to the mountains, the only downside it's the limited bus schedule, so I was just able to stay a couple hours. Another bad (and probably quite controversial) thing I discovered it's that the regional food in Trentino it's not as good as in the rest of the regions of Italy, or I just probably had bad luck, who knows.

**Rimini**

Against all odds, because literally everyone I met told me that it was silly to go to Rimini at that time because it was low-season, I finally arrived to Rimini.

Everyone was right, it was totally empty and the ocean was freezing. But there was something special and unique about the cold and peacefulness of it. I mainly wanted to go to Rimini to look for a souvenir of the Isola della Rosa, but everyone I asked told me it would be quite impossible to find.

While looking and asking for the souvenir I had a fun interaction with a group of mid-40s Italians, they knew a little bit of English and I knew a bit of Italian so we figured it out, I asked them about the souvenir but they were sad because they thought I was actually looking for the island (that was destroyed 50 years ago), they told me it was bombed and didn't exists anymore and they tried to cheer me up with some small talk and we took group pictures (yes, I took group picture with some strangers I met 10 minutes ago, not very introvert of me).

Later on I just walked around through the city from sunset to late night until the rain started.

I'll update this report more on the comments, but I just want to give some final thoughts I learned on this travel to anyone who is looking for start solo travels:

-*It's okay to feel awkward:* I think the main fear I had to face was to feel comfortable with myself and be confident, which it's kind of hard. So what helps me to deal with it was to try small interactions and realize the wonderful thing about being in another country, no one knows you! So you can make awkward mistakes but feel relieved that you might not going to see that person ever again! So go and talk with that group, ask that person to hang out, if it's a ""no"" or an awkward moment just forget about it or move to another city (literally, that's the power of solo travel), best case scenario, you'll have the night of your life or you'll get a Before Sunrise memory for lifetime.

-*You'll learn a lot about you as soon as you feel comfortable with you:* Some people find difficult and sometimes sad to solo travel because they feel lonely. The truth is that it's inevitable to be and feel alone sometimes, but you can take advantage of it by  discovering yourself, what makes you happy and what makes you sad, and have a little bit more control about it. You'll also learn to solve more things by yourself and thus feel more confident about yourself.

-*Be happy about what happened, not sad about what could have happened:* Some of the friends I made were sad about all the friends and memories they made during their journey and becoming to close to each other just to say goodbye a couple of days later. One actually asked me ""How someone could cope with that?"", So I just said that I could just be happy and enjoy what's happening right now because it's actually happening because I made it happen, and just hope for the best in the future. Which leads me to...

-*Do Journaling!!:* For a long time I found it quite a silly activity, but later on I discovered that it helped me to retain more details about the memories and experiences I had. For this travel I tried to write a weekly summary each time I was on the train or the bus, and it has made me easier to remember the little details that made this trip a wonderful adventure!

I know that solo travelling around Europe could be considered like the Easiest-Level of solo travelling because it's the travel where you struggle less with language barriers, transport and safety, but I still hope something about the experience could be helpful to anyone.

solotravel,1f8ya6x,"Slovenia in October, tips?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f8ya6x/slovenia_in_october_tips/,18,"Planning a solo trip to Slovenia for October. Mainly a reach out for any advice about things to I ought to consider/tips etc before heading out? Would appreciate hearing others experiences!

I'm 26M, of dark complexion. Not really worried about any racism/discrimination but also conscious of the fact that ignorant people exist in all places and dealing with their lack of self awareness can be mentally taxing. I guess my question is how switched on do I need to be wrt to this throughout my trip. 

I've scheduled for 5 days, not aiming to run around like a headless chicken and tick boxes. Ideally I'd be based in 2 locations tops. I'm thinking kranjska gora and Trenta? Again would appreciate any suggestions.

Finally as every introvert can relate, while I appreciate the occasional wholesome interaction, I really am hoping that this trip can be an opportunity to unwind as well as get some good solitude hours in. I understand I'm a ultimately just another tourist so to expect empty trails/areas is unrealistic (and probably an indication your  a bit self absorbed) but on the flip side I'm not really interested in places crawling with tourists. Is this a realistic expectation for Slovenia in October? If not I'll probably have some cancelling to do....

I'm a teacher and this would be my first solo travel. It would be from the end of June '25 until the beginning of September (yay free summer for teachers!). I have travelled a lot, though mostly through Europe, North America and SEA, and I've always wanted to travel to Australia and New Zealand. I live in Spain so since it's a fairly long journey just getting there I thought I should use this opportunity and visit both countries. I'm not entirely sure if it's feasible or not.  
  
I would like to know if there are some must-see places to explore or if I should just stay the whole 10 weeks in one place since it's more than likely this is the only time I'd be able to visit.  
  
Per my research, the places I would absolutely want to see are: Rottnest Island, Sidney, Melbourne, Cairns and, if possible, Brisbane. Keep in mind I'm not planning on driving since it's on the other side of the read and from what i've gathered it's very easy to underestimate travelling distances in Australia, so I know there will be some domestic flights involved.  
  
From NZ, my must-see are: Auckland, Rotorua, Hobbiton, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown. In this last one I'd like to do some hiking, but since it would be winter there I don't know how difficult this might be or feasible.  
  
I do want to do some whale watching and I've see that I can do that from Cairns or Milford Sound, any preferences?  
  
My idea is to start from Porto Airport ( this is the nearest international one from where I live) and take a plane to Rome Fiumicino and from there get to either Sidney or Melbourne (this is from where I've seen the cheapest flights) and start the Australian leg of the trip from there or go to NZ and then come back to finish the trip. I am aware of the time difference and the super long flights (my longest one was 13hrs) and I know the first night/day is kind of lost trying to adapt to the time difference.  
  
I would like to see if somebody has tried this before and if it seems at all possible or if I'm just setting myself up for failure.  
  
Also I'm wondering about mobile data and if I need to buy a SIM for each country because I think it might be difficult to get around only relying on WiFi when I can find it.

solotravel,1f8ussn,What license do I need,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f8ussn/what_license_do_i_need/,13,"So in the second half of October I'm planning a solo trip to SE Asia (to be precise Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) and I'm just wondering what license do I need to get in order to rent a scooter in these places. I looked on internet and found out I need international drivers license, the 1949 to be precise since it should cover all the countries except Laos where you can't drive without their license from my understanding.

So the problem is this. I only have my car license (B and B1) with which I also get the AM license (which is limited to motorcycles only up to 50cc) and I'm wondering what license should I get in order to legally drive there. I can get the A1 license (up to 125cc and 11kW) or A2 license (engine power up to 35kW and the ratio between the power of an engine and weight of the bike should be lower than 0,2KW/kg), but I can't get the A license (without restrictions) since i have to be 24 years or older in my country (Slovenia if that helps).

So my question is what license do you actually need to drive there, do I need A or does A1 or A2 work as well, and if I need A should I even go to the trouble of getting A1 or A2 license and the International drivers license or should I just drive without it and pray nothing bad happens. And if I get stopped do I only need to pay the fee or can I get into more trouble. Also is there a possibility I can rent bikes which are okay to ride with just the AM license.

Also most of the information I found was only about Thailand so information about other countries would be great as well. Thanks in advance!",2024-09-04 14:30:47

This was a reminder for myself when I wasn’t used to solo traveling , and I hope it can help others.

Here are the tips for staying in a hostel in Europe for the first time:

1. Bring your own toiletries like shower gel and toothbrush. Some hostels provide them, but it's safer to be prepared.

2. Don't leave personal items in the common areas or kitchen—they might get stolen! (RIP my charging cable)

3. Make sure to bring an eye mask and earplugs! There will definitely be roommates snoring like pigs, singing ""Country Road"" loudly at 3 AM, which can be really annoying.

4. Bring your own lock. Many hostels don’t provide locks for the lockers, and purchasing one at the hostel can be really expensive.

5. Always keep your luggage and valuables with you or locked up! Don't take any chances (like I did).

6. Spend time in the common areas in the evening, grab some tea, and switch into social mode; you can make some great friendships (I absolutely love Argentine daddies!).

7. But before checking in, make sure to read the reviews, especially the one-star ones. Check if the downsides are acceptable to you.

Good luck to you guys!",2024-09-03 07:14:52
solotravel,1f7z5uq,Which countries are you truly NOT allowed to solo travel?,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f7z5uq/which_countries_are_you_truly_not_allowed_to_solo/,84,"I don’t think travelling on a private tour can be considered a form of solo travel, so any country that prohibits *independent* travel, by definition, prohibits solo travel. 

The only country which I know prohibits any form of solo or independent travel is North Korea (the closest you can get is booking a private tour). 

The following countries are where solo travel *used to* be prohibited, or where there exist, at least officially, loopholes around the general prohibition: 

Bhutan: Independent travel has finally been allowed since 2022, although this is limited to the main valleys of Paro and Thimphu. Tourists need to pay a Sustainably Development Fee (SDF) for each day they spend in the country, which may discourage more budget-minded travellers.

Eritrea: Independent travel is allowed in the capital, Asmara. To visit the rest of the country, a permit needs to be obtained, which does *not* require the service of a tour agency (although, of course, it might be less time-consuming and hassle that way). 

Turkmenistan: Independent travel is allowed on a Transit Visa (provided you are able to obtain one in the first place). However, the maximum duration you are allowed to remain in the country on a Transit Visa is between 5-7 days.

There seems to be a lot of conflicting information online about conflict-zone countries (e.g., Syria, Libya) and unrecognised governments (e.g., Taliban-ruled Afghanistan). It is probably not advisable to solo travel in many of them at the moment, but your input regarding them is welcome.

I'm planning a 1 week trip in Georgia towards the end of the month, 3 days in Tbilisi, 3 days in Batumi with one travel day between the two cities.

One of the questions I have is I'd like to do a day stopover in Gori during that transition day to visit the Stalin museum. Would I need to book a night in Gori as I've read conflicting information around how many trains do the Tbilisi - Batumi route on a daily basis (some say it's 1 train, others say it's multiple).

I plan to watch football for 2 of the days I'm in Tbilisi and one match in Batumi. Is there anything else you'd recommend or think I should be wary of?

Also I'm planning another separate trip in Armenia towards the end of the year. I'm aware I can travel between the two and make it one trip, but I wouldn't be able to do what I want to do in one of Armenia or Georgia if I did this, hence the two separate trips.

Took an early flight from my home country to maximise my time in Vienna, as it was my shortest layover due to the high cost of accomodation. I didn't do a lot of research and didn't really know what to expect aside from expensive prices.

 

That being said, I absolutely loved my time there and would've loved to spend one more day there. I felt like there was no such thing as an ugly building in the whole of Vienna city centre. Couldn't join a walking tour (sold out since April lol) so I explored on my own and it was absolutely worth it. Probably one of my favourite cities in the world in terms of architecture, I kept unintentionally bumping into astonishing churches, palaces or other buildings without actively looking for them. Of course I wandered around Ringstrasse, visited Schonbrunn and entered the (Upper) Belvedere Museum, all 100% reccomended.

 

I kinda expected a quiet atmosphere in there and, while it didn't look like the most partying city in the world, it was pretty chill to see lots of young people haging in parks and gardens. As I was there a very short time, I can't really judge its people, but the few ones I talked to were just lovely. There was a film festival by the Town Hall building and I asked a local to take me a photo in front of the building. That moment turned into a beer together and an hour long chat about the country, how Austrian and Viennese people are, etc. Meeting people like this so unexpectedly is priceless.

 

Bratislava - 4 nights:

Yeah, I know, that's too much time in Bratislava. I kinda agree, but not entirely. Arrived there from Vienna around 3pm, took a nap and went out there. I went at the UFO Observation Deck and sunset and while the view was the best one could get in town, the weather made it uncomfortable. Pro tip: if it's slightly windy on ground level, it's going to be very heavy 100 metres above.

 

On the first full day I ended up doing two walking tours, so I pretty much saw the entire city by then. Lovely place but the old town is indeed SMALL.

 

Next day it was time to explore this country a bit more, and I decided to do 2 cities in one day. Caught an early train to Trencin, where I wandered around the old town and visited its castle. Ideal city for a day trip. After lunch I took the train back, but stopped in Trnava. Another small, charming city just 30 minutes away from Bratislava, you MUST go to the Synagogue Café if you visit Trnava.

 

Last full day in Bratislava and fatigue was starting to hit, but I kept going and went to Devin Castle (there's one thing about Slovakia and castles that I haven't seen anywhere else). After lunch I took it way more easily, extending my time at parks or cafés by reading a bit. A break was needed since I was hitting a local club for a metal concert in the evening.

 

While Bratislava is probably not worth 5 days, Slovakia felt like a country full of hidden gems worth exploring: High Tatras is definitely now on my list for future trips. All locals were kind and welcoming and their cuisine is super underrated.

 

Budapest - 4 nights:

Where to start in here? My expectations were high, and they were absolutely surpassed. Firstly, I, for some reason, was expecting a smaller city than it actually is, so I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but I quickly felt adapted to its pace. I arrived there around 5pm, so I decided to take it easy and visit just one spot, as I had another two walking tours the following day. I went to Margaret Island and... well... I also underestimated its size

 

First full day and I fell in love with every sight we saw during the tours, the bridges, the River, everything... The Parliament building is definitely on my Top 3 building I've ever seen, and the Buda side was a vibe, very different from the rest of the city, and with breathtaking views.

 

Other than that, I did most of the usual stuff. Another Pro Tip: If possible, take advantage of the early morning ticket for Szechenyi Bath (from 7am to 9am, only available on-site), you'll avoid the crowds, save a few bucks and start off your day in a unique way.

 

There, in Budapest, I was also lucky to meet people every night but the first one. After the walking tours, I chatted with a small group and ended up joining them to hit Szimpla Kert. The next day I met a lovely English couple at a tourist bar. Then, on the final night, I went to the second most known ruin bar, Fuge Udvar, much quieter than Szimpla Kert (also worth noting that I visited Szimpla on a Saturday and Fuge on a Monday). Had a beer, was ready to leave by midnight when a Spanish couple asked me to take their pic, and midnight quickly became 3am.

 

I'd say the only downside of Budapest was that, especially being August, it felt a bit too touristy. It was mega crowded, and I felt like everywhere I went (pubs, sites, restaurants, etc.) were places locals rarely step foot in. I didn't feel really connected to the local life like I felt in Slovakia, a weird feeling I had experienced from the other side (I live in Barcelona, so you know what I mean). Worht noticing as well that, while the weather was quite bearable in Bratislava and Vienna, Budapest was HOT.

 

That would be pretty much it, I'm already looking into plans for Easter 2025, when I'll be able to travel again (destination advice appreciated). About me: 26M from Spain, I mostly look to get to dicover the culture of a place when I travel, its history, culture, architecture and cuisine . I'll also enjoy exploring the nature, more on the hike side than the laying-at-the-beach side (I'm the 25k steps a day kind of traveller). Not big into parties but enjoy the occasional drink that spontaneously turns into a long-ish night. Feedback and questions well appreciated :)",2024-09-03 10:17:31

I’ll be in Peru for a few weeks this month (September) I will be based in Huaraz and Cusco for 7-10 days each. Doing the Santa Cruz and Salkantay treks but looking for day trips to add. Preference but not need for them to be hiking related…

The lakes near Huaraz look beautiful

May consider Choquequirao as a multi day hike

Am leaning away from Rainbow Mountain - I doubt it looks like the edited photos and worry it’s super crowded…

Anything not to miss in either place?

I've found a good flight connection that lets me start in Dakar and finish in Banjul, so I'm planning four days in Dakar with day trips to Goree island and Bandia reserve.
Is it worth to do a 2D/1N trip to St. Louis? What's a good and safe/reliable way to go from Dakar?

As for the Gambia, I couldn't find any info for places to visit apart from Banjul. Is there a national park or reserve worth staying a night or two?

Is it reliable to book tours and guides on Viator or GetYourGuide? Are there any other websites that I should check?

I read so many bad reviews on Belgium and particularly Brussels. 
I had absolutely no problems, and loved every second of it. It is so beautiful, rich in history and the locals I met were lovely!

I based myself in Brussels, and did trips to Bruges, Dinant, Ghent and Luxembourg. 

I did not get hassled once, i took public transport without problem. I do still recommend general caution. I have a backpack that can only be accessed by a zip against my back - to avoid pickpockets and my phone is on a lanyard (as I was pulling it out for photos alllll the time). 

I would go back, and would recommend. 

I am posting this as I was a bit anxious to come here, and could have used some reassurance :)

Has anyone done a day of biking to vineyards in burgundy? Which vineyards should I add to my list? Recommendations for Dijon, where I will stay, also accepted!

solotravel,1f81dhl,Mexico to Guatemala whistle-stop itinerary for critique  ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f81dhl/mexico_to_guatemala_whistlestop_itinerary_for/,18,"Hi all,

so, I travelled quite a bit in my 20's, both solo and in a couple (USA, Europe, Vietnam, China). Shortly after I turned 30, I got divorced and poured my heart into setting up and running my own business. As I approach 40, I realise I haven't travelled abroad in 7 years and rather than wait around for a new companion have decided to just get on with having an adventure under my own steam.

I'm intending to close my business for a month in January (my quietest time of year) and have booked return flights to Cancun from the 5th to the 24th (flying from London). I have put £1000 ($1300) into a savings account for spending money.

I did consider an organised solo-tour group that would take care of everything for me, however I did one of these in the USA and to be honest, a couple of the other travellers were less than agreeable. 

Hopeful that planning and going solo gives me a little more agency over things, leaves me free to hopefully mingle with other travellers but without the obligation to stay attached to them for days on end if we don't click. Slightly worried i'll be seen as an old fart at 38, but I expect a few beers will get everyone on the same level. 

My intention is to make my way to Guatemala, via Belize and have prepared the following draft itinerary. I have dropped a few things from my original plans (Tulum, Lanquin, Rio Dulce) in order to keep things fairly tight, and opted for an internal flight to fit in both Flores and Antigua as efficiently as possible. 

Very much appreciate a critique of my itinerary, as well as any tips, advice or suggestions to stuff I should add, or even subtract (one day more in Caye Caulker, one day less in Flores for example?)

  
5^(th) Jan Cancun – arrive 16:55

6^(th) Bus (ADO?) to Bacalar – 5hrs approx.

7^(th) Bacalar

8^(th) Bacalar

9^(th) Bacalar to Chetumal (Bus) to Caye Caulker (Water Taxi / ferry – approx. 3.5 hrs) (figure out timing and border crossing procedure)

10^(th) Caye Caulker

11^(th) Caye Caulker

12^(th) Caye Caulker ferry to Belize City (1 hour), Shuttle to San Ignacio (2ish hours)

13^(th) San Ignacio (ATM Caves?)

14^(th) San Ignacio to Flores (shuttle 2-3hrs, inc border crossing)

15^(th) Flores

16^(th) Flores – Tikal Ruins?

17^(th) Flores to Guatemala City (fly – 1 hr) Shuttle/Bus to Antigua

18^(th) Antigua

19^(th) Antigua – Acatenango Volcano (depart 09:00)

20^(th) Acatenango return 13:00/14:00

21^(st) Shuttle to Panajachel (16:00 – 2.5hrs) water taxi to another town? San Jaun?

22^(nd) Lake Atitlan

23^(rd) Panajachel (or San Pedro?) to Guatemala City shuttle – stay in airport hotel for simplicity

24^(th) Guatamala City to Cancun flight 10:14-13:03, Cancun flight home 18:40

Thanks travellers!",2024-09-03 14:29:47

I have a flight booked to Lima for later this month. I arrive early in the morning (\~5:40am) and then need to head to Cusco for the first leg of my trip (I'm spending more time in Lima on the back-end). 

My understanding is that the Lima --> Cusco flights are pretty frequent. Can I afford to wait and buy the ticket once I land in Lima? I want to head out as soon as possible, but I also don't want to risk being delayed arriving at Lima and then having to worry about making adjustments to the Cusco flight.

If I do that, do I risk flights selling out? Prices going way up? Or is it pretty straightforward to hop on the next available flight out of Lima.  ",2024-09-03 14:26:19

solotravel,1f7sfk9,"Trip Report: São Paulo, Brazil",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f7sfk9/trip_report_são_paulo_brazil/,0,"**About me and this trip:** I’m a solo traveler (duh). Brazil is also part of a multi-country vacation in South America. I speak low-intermediate (B1) Spanish and know zero Portuguese. 

**Transportation:** I flew to SP from Montevideo, UY via Latam. Great service for a short flight. I used Uber all throughout my trip. From the airport (GRU) to Pinheiros (where I stayed), it was $17. Average Uber is $4. There’s a metro system in SP, but I never used it.

**Accommodation**: I stayed at an Airbnb in the Pinheiros neighborhood. It was $132 for three nights.

**Places I visited:**

* Beco do Batman - Fun place with lots of murals.
* Catedral Metropolitano de São Paulo
* Mercado Municipal Paulistano
* Avenida Paulista on a Sunday - It was chaotic (in a good way) and I loved it.

**Where I ate and drank:**

Even though my Airbnb had a full kitchen, I ate out every single day (except for the first). Highly recommended places:

* Croma’s Beer - Excellent brewpub with good food that go well with their tasty beers. (If they’re pouring their Imperial Stout, you should try it.)
* Bar do Baixo - Spacious place for dancing. Great food!
* Guarita - Their cocktails were amazing—get the Penicillin. Did not eat.
* Beer4u Pinheiros - Another brewpub with an Imperial Stout that was \*chefs kiss.\* They had barbecued meats on a stick, empanadas, and bar nuts that people can order along with their beer.
* Diavola Pizzeria Italiana - (Sidebar: The change in weather from very cold in Uruguay and Argentina to summer-like in Brazil got me feeling feverish on the first day.) In my head, their pizzas had some magic elixir that helped me recover, because after I inhaled their Parma e Rucola and Margherita, I was 100 percent better the next day. There’s seating outside and on the second floor, but I brought the food home.
* Conceição Discos - A woman-owned restaurant that exclusively employs women. I ordered their Arroz de Pato (Portuguese duck rice) that was so good, I got another one. (Sorry, for some reason I was ravenous when I went to Brazil.) I got a slice of flan (Pudim de Leite), a cup of coffee (Café Coado), agua fresca (Refresco de Hibisco), and Hocus Pocus beers. This was my favorite out of all the places I’ve been to in SP.
* Izakaya Donchan - Go for the sake and curry, stay for the karaoke.
* Bosco Restaurante - Their carbonara was amazing.

**My recommendations:**

* Download the Google Translate app - My Spanish only helped with reading Portuguese, and I only encountered a few Brazilians who spoke English.
* According to my friend who lives in RdJ, SP is safer. Nevertheless, he told me to stay away from certain neighborhoods and head inside a store if I need to use my phone for an extended period of time.

**Final words:**

I was happy during my time in SP. I struggled with communication but otherwise it’s an easy barrier to overcome. Safety wasn’t too much of an issue but I was doubly cautious. Since most flights to Brazil from the USA go to SP first, I won’t have problems stopping here for a few days before continuing on to RdJ, Florianopolis, or Curitiba.",2024-09-03 05:43:14

I'm mapping out my last few days of PTO and I realized I've got at least 7 that I can put towards a trip in late November/early December. I'm 30F and have been to Asia solo quite a few times (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh) and would be flying from London > HK. My dates away would be:

**Dates**: November 21 - December 1 (roughly 10 days total accounting for timezone change)  
**Budget**: None whatsoever! I am willing to pay whatever for great cuisine and fun experiences  
**Interests**: FOOD, hiking, beaches, nightlife (more for rooftop bars or swanky restaurants, I am not as much of a partier as I used to be), culture/temples. I am also passionate about wellness/yoga and exercise

My question is: With those dates in mind, is 9 days in Hong Kong too many? Should I consider heading to Macau, Singapore, Osaka, or a Thai island anywhere else within that time? I'll be going to Taipei for a work conference in February next year and wanted to tack on 4-5 days in Tokyo so those two places are out, but I am open to any other suggestions!

How do you guys over the loneliness with solo travel, I feel like there needs to be more than just “loving your own presence” or “loving yourself” 

Right now I’m (23 M) in the midst of spending 6 months abroad (3 months in London) (3 months in madrid) and it’s been amazing. I’m doing so much exploring and realizing what I love doing in life. I already have friends here because I spent a year with them as they studied in America at my school and we got real close. I’m meeting so many new people, and growing my connections. This has all been great but I still just feel lonely, I see everyone hanging out with their childhood friends and family. I miss it, I miss my friends I grew up with, I miss my family and my ordinary life in America. I’m happy with my current friends but damn it’s just not the same. I’m thinking of just going back to America but I don’t know if it’s worth it. It’s like wave of loneliness I feel, maybe I should get a new hobby like learn a new language but I don’t know. 

I think about maybe finding a friend or a romantic partner to travel with but no one I know is willing to or has the same ability like me and I feel bad about establishing a deep connection here because I know I have to leave and don’t want a long distance relationship but you never know.

Running away OR not for me",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f6v1hi/running_away_or_not_for_me/,58,"I'vebeen travelling around for a while now, Mainly the balkans and other somewhat obscure places. I recently decided to do a big one - south America. I've been learning Spanish for three months, although upon my arrival a few days ago it has become obvious I am BAD at it, people speak and I just have no idea, none. I try to use sentences I've learnt and still no-one understands what I'm saying. There are mosquitos everywhere and they eat me for breakfast lunch and dinner, the humidity means I'm sweating to the point of dripping, it's disgusting. And I don't know any of the bugs, the spiders are huge and honestly I feel way out of my depth. I've done the solo travelling thing a while, but this feels ridiculous, like I was playing football in the street with papercup goals and now I'm against Ronaldo in the semifinals. I'm only young and don't want to regret giving up so soon in 10yrs time, but holy moly, this is not fun so far. If it's more of the same, maybe it's not for me, is it worth suffering few a few more weeks just to give up anyway? I could go back to eroipe and try Asia or the colder countries? Any advice? I'd love to stay but honestly it's unlike anything I've done before and the language barrier is frustrating! Would love any advice",2024-09-02 01:45:11
solotravel,1f6zj0h,advice for 2 weeks in the UK in autumn ,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f6zj0h/advice_for_2_weeks_in_the_uk_in_autumn/,29,"I'm planning a 2 week trip to the UK from 23 Oct to 5 Nov and it'll be my first time in the UK. Thinking of flying into Edinburgh and flying out of London to save time travelling. I have a friend studying in the UK who may join me for a few days but the trip will be mostly solo. I won't be renting a car as I'm not confident driving alone, so I'll rely on public transport as much as possible. I'm open to booking day tours but I do find them a bit expensive (especially given the exchange rate T\_T).

So far my rough itinerary will be:

Day 1-2: Edinburgh for 2 nights

Day 3-4: Edinburgh > Inverness by train, stay in Inverness for 2 nights

Day 5-6: Inverness > Isle of Skye by bus, stay there for 2 nights

Day 7: Isle of Skye > Glasgow by bus, stay there for 1 night (I wasn't planning on going to Glasgow but it makes the most sense transport-wise if I'm going York/London after Isle of Skye)

Day 8: Glasglow > York by train, stay for 1 night

Day 9-14: York to London by train, stay in London for the remainder of the trip with some day trips out to Oxford/the Cotswolds/Canterbury/Bath (still undecided on where exactly)

Is my itinerary well-paced or is it too rushed if I'm relying solely on public transport? I'm open to minus a few days from London to add to somewhere else if needed, and I'm also open to skipping York if needed, as I added York mostly to break up the journey between Glasgow and London.

My interests are hiking/nature, culture and history, trying local food, gin, and craft cocktails. Any recommendations that aligns with my interests are welcome!",2024-09-02 06:00:07

I’ll be backpacking and staying in cheap Airbnbs, and I am OK with getting a taste of multiple places and spending lots of time on a boat.  Im a 40f btw, obvi traveling solo.

I just booked all of my flights and Airbnb and ferried so theitinerary is set. But I am super interested in any advice or suggestions (or things you hated!) that anyone has. 😊

Day 1, arrive in Athens at 2:00pm.  Booked a place near the port.  

Day 2, early morning ferry to Paros.  Arrive at 11:00am.  Staying in Naoussas.  

Day 3, Paros.

Day 4, pretty much the whole day in Paros.  Ferry to Milo’s at 6:50pm.  I’ll have to figure out what to do with my bag after check out.  If it’s worth keeping it at my airbnb in Naoussas or leaving it near the port.  

Arrive in Milos at 8:50pm.  Airbnb by the port.

Day 5, Milo’s.   Definitely a boat tour.  Debating between a whole day and half day.  

Day 6, pretty much the whole day in Milos.  Ferry back to Athens leaving at 5:30pm.  Leaving my bag at the airbnb.  Thinking of renting a scooter on this day?  I’d be gross by the time I got to the ferry unless there’s a place to shower somewhere, but that’s not the end of the world.

Arrive in Athens at 8:40 pm.  Airbnb in Plaka.

Day 7, Athens.  I’m thinking a food tour this day.  My partner is a real history buff and won’t be coming on this trip, so I want to save a lot of the history stuff for when we come back together.

Day 8, Flight out of Athens at 2:30pm.  Arrive in Copenhagen at 5pm.  Night layover which I’m kind of excited about, so airbnb in easy access to the airport.  Leave Copenhagen the next day at noon.",2024-09-02 14:24:47

solotravel,1f6fqhk,5 Week Balkans Trip Report,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f6fqhk/5_week_balkans_trip_report/,18,"Hi everyone, just wrapped up the latest section of my extended solo travel around the world, figured I would share my experience in the Balkans during the month of August. I started this section in Sofia, Bulgaria, and travelled generally in a C-shape (bottom to top) and ended in Belgrade, Serbia. Along the way I passed through Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, and Bosnia & Herzegovina. For accommodation I used a mix of AirBNBs, hostels, and guesthouses.

A few general notes:

1. Excluding Croatia & Slovenia, and with the notable exception of Montenegro, the Balkans remain incredibly affordable destinations by comparison to U.S./Western Europe experience. Of course prices have increased as they have everywhere in the last few years, but don't be put off by cost. Plan ahead, know where you are comfortable to compromise on price (food, hostels, etc.), and enjoy!
2. Don't plan much on travel days, especially when you're crossing a border. I heard and read a lot of horror stories about bus travel, and while I certainly had some less than ideal experiences, I think I mostly made it through okay. Nevertheless, you don't know how long border crossings will take, even buses with A/C may not be enough to keep you cool when it's nearly 40 outside, and the process is just exhausting regardless.
3. Do yourself a favor and just spend the extra 1-2 EUR on bottled water. I understand that the tap water is generally considered safe and it's of course more environmentally friendly not to use plastic bottles, but I got horrendously sick in northern Albania and I'm 85% sure it could have been avoided by just not drinking tap. Don't be like me.
4. Cash is still king, especially if you're not in a capital city. Grocery stores almost universally accept card, except in the smallest of towns. The places where cash was the most necessary were Macedonia and Bosnia & Herzegovina.
5. You'll mostly be able to get by with English, or at the very least be as polite as you can and point and you can get what you need. It's not much effort and best to say hello, thank you, etc. in local, and then you can switch to English. Balkan people are incredibly kind and will do their best to help you because hospitality is so deeply ingrained in the culture.

Ok, top tips aside, here's a little more detail on my destinations:

Sofia, Bulgaria (5 nights)

Lovely, green and walkable city that I instantly fell in love with. The center is pretty compact, there's a metro line that connects to the airport (with tap to pay entry no less!!), and it just feels like a place to take it slow and enjoy. I was amazed to see a burgeoning vegan/vegetarian food scene here (since Balkan cuisine tends to be heavily meat-based).

For activities, I did a free food tour with Balkan Bites (highly recommend), as well as day trips to Rila Monastery and the Seven Rila Lakes. There are several companies that run these tours, the one I used was called Traventuria and they did a great job. Reasonable price and good staff.

Skopje, Macedonia (2 nights)

I read about how ""weird"" Skopje is and the reality lives up to this moniker. The architectural mishmash of imitation classicism with a healthy dose of socialist brutalism really is quite odd. Skopje is HOT (literally) and with pollution and nearby wildfires, the afternoon hours from about 2-5pm were miserable to be outside.

I did not know the city boasted such a large and well-preserved Ottoman-era market district, which is cool to explore.

Ohrid, Macedonia (2 nights, planned 3)

It's popular with locals/regional tourism for those who enjoy boats and rocky beaches. There are some pretty churches and good cheap eats, but as I am not a beach or boat person I was not super impressed. Ending up leaving a day early.

Tirana, Albania (3 nights, planned 2)

This city was surprisingly pleasant to me, though admittedly as a tourist destination it doesn't have much to offer. The novelty of the giant Skanderbeg Square and Hoxha's Pyramid won't keep you occupied for long. I didn't get a chance to take the cable car to Dajti but heard it was nice.

Shkoder, Albania (2 nights)

Stopped off here for a night before hiking. There are some fantastic hostels in this town, highly recommend Travelers where I stayed but heard good things about Wanderers and Shkodra Hostel as well. Any can help you with booking the logistics for your hike if you didn't do anything in advance.

Valbona/Theth, Albania (1 night V, 2 nights T)

It's become a super popular hike so don't come here expecting to be off the beaten path, but it is definitely a wonderful hike. I'm pretty athletic and it took me about 4 hours, but 5-6 is the general expectation. Guesthouses on both ends can prepare meals for you as options are quite limited (especially on the Valbona side). The day after the big hike I undertook a second hike to the Theth Blue Eye, a natural spring about 8 miles from town, where I got horribly sick. Spent the rest of my time with my head in a bucket :(

Podgorica, Montenegro (1 night)

Booked a night here as a stopover between Shkoder and Kotor. Feel free to skip.

Kotor, Montenegro (5 nights)

If you're familiar with Dubrovnik, the vibe in Kotor is similar, it's just about 1/8th the size of Dubrovnik, not that it stops cruise ships from disembarking hundreds of daytrippers into the narrow streets on the daily. If you want to visit Kotor, I recommend walking around early or in the evening after the cruise ship(s) are gone. Hiking the fortress is great fun, if you go early enough you can enter without paying the fee, then find the secret way out back to avoid the gates ;)

I also did a day tour here to visit a few other nearby sites but I really can't recommend - traffic in the Kotor area is awful as there is one highway for all of these small towns that are simply overrun with summer tourists, so even a short (distance) drive can take triple the time it should. Montenegro is also several orders of magnitude more expensive than anywhere else in the Balkans (again excepting Croatia) and I didn't find the experience to be any better for the price you're paying.

Trebinje, Bosnia & Herzegovina (2 nights)

It's a small town in the far southeast with a historic bridge and a monastery on a hill. Kind of a trippy place as a westerner as this is firmly in RS (even the president of RS arrived as I was leaving town).

Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina (3 nights)

I visited Mostar just over a decade ago and it's nice to see how the town has grown up. It's a little more prepared for tourism now, but of course people mainly just mob the bridge. There are a number of good museums if you're interested in learning more about the war, and lots of companies offering day tours to a few sites outside of town including the lovely Kravica waterfalls. I booked a private tour at a very reasonable price and was super satisfied.

Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina (4 nights)

Another town I've visited before, so I had a lot of plans to visit sites both familiar and new. Unfortunately I fell ill again and had to severely limit my plans to see more of the city. If you're a first-timer or don't have much background on the war, I highly recommend taking a guided tour as you will learn a lot about the city's history, the siege, and how Bosnia has recovered in the last 30 years.

Belgrade, Serbia (5 nights)

Last but not least, the cosmopolitan metropolis of Belgrade is much larger than any of the other capitals, and more spread out in area as well. The enormous St. Sava Cathedral is definitely worth a visit, though there are several more historic churches dotted across the city center as well. I enjoyed walking through the fortress that overlooks the Sava and Danube river confluence.

It's quite easy to hop on a train to Novi Sad, less than an hour north and with a very different feel than Belgrade. Since it was part of Austria-Hungary the architecture feels more Central European, and the main square has a Catholic church rather than Serbian Orthodox. You can also tack on a quick stop in the pleasant town of Sremski Karlovci, just a few km from Novi Sad, and on the train line back to Belgrade.

\*Final Verdict:\*

If you've read this far, thanks! And hope this was helpful. Happy to answer any questions in comments or DMs :)",2024-09-01 14:27:49

I’m planning on taking out the back seats and fitting a mattress/ basic ‘carliving’ setup- that way I can save a lot on accommodation by spending 50%+ nights stealth sleeping/ camping places. No general plan on the route besides ‘southern states in Jan, then head north as it gets to spring’. My car is a 2021 Chrysler with low mileage so mechanically sound- but not planning for it to ever leave asphalt. I have a LOT of savings so while money is not a concern- I don’t want to be stupid in how I spend it. 

While I’d try to find social people on my travels, I’m aware US is not like Europe as good hostels would be few and far between. With that being said what advice would you give me before I set off? Or is the whole idea kinda dumb?",2024-09-01 22:31:10

Living in Italy for about a year now and I am proud to say I did a lot of travelling. For the first months being here I always solo travel whenever I get the chance to (4 day weekend).

Also add the the holidays which I spent with my cousins who live in UK and my parents visiting me. In my work I really don't have a close friend that I could just ask to travel with me and the preference I have is very different from them (they like to party and do clubbing). How do I motivate myself to solo travel more? I am in a 4 day weekend and I just aimlessly drove around.

Like I don’t want to meet people just travel around the world and absorb the amazing views for hours. 

I used to join some groups but it was always annoying to me, I mean don’t get me wrong the people are very nice but I just can’t put up with people being late or having to need a bathroom break at the worst time. Having a preplanned itinerary that I must follow at exact times also feels like a job. 

I’m not the type of guy to complain though I just leave so I have escaped some groups by saying I’m going to the bathroom never to return and had an amazing time afterwards. Don’t think they missed me though as I don’t talk much and I don’t ask any questions.
so now I travel full solo only.

When other travelers try speaking to me I pretend not knowing the language with a « sorry » face. 
I interact with locals but it is mostly my taxi driver or restaurant/shop workers.

Since then no more group tours, I only hire a private local guide if I really need to, I just love being spontaneous and suddenly change plans which a lot of people don’t like to do. Ie, I’m traveling towards a mountain and halfway there I see an interesting village that would take a 2 hour detour and I go for it. 

One time I was in Peru hiking all alone and I couldn’t see a soul for miles. I just sat down for a long time soaking the experience in it was amazing. I also like sitting in a cafe in a new city with my tablet sipping my drink and watching the world go by at fast pace. 

I know most people here like to meet groups at hostels and party but are there any other people like me to share their experiences ? Why have you decided to solo travel? What was your highlight?

Back home in the US when I tell people I travel for a month they think I’m crazy and can’t believe I did it that long(benefit of being a teacher) but when I was traveling most people I asked at hostels were either traveling as long as me or even longer like 3 months.

I'm new here, this is the first time i share any of my travel reports so i hope i'm doing it well. I traveled from the netherlands to switzerland, with my car. Hope you enjoy!

Day 1: Today I drove to Switzerland by car. It was the first time for me to drive that far so it was a bit exciting. I also found it quite exciting to drive my car in the mountains. Fortunately, everything went pretty well, only in the beginning I had a bit of a dip but later it felt better again. In the evening I arrived, it was national holiday so there were very nice fireworks at rheinfall in schafhaussen. In the evening I met some more people and had some champagne with them.


Day 2: Today I went to rheinfall again, but during the day. Here I went on a boat, this was quite spectacular, with all the power of the water. Later I went towards camping murg, in murg. Here at the end of the afternoon I went to seerenbach falls. This was not an extremely large waterfall but beautiful.


Day 3: Today I did a hike in val sumvitg, this was quite a nice piece of nature. Later I went to camping carerra. In the evening I also went to rheinschlucht, here I met another person who was also on vacation alone, with whom I talked to for a while. I would bake pancakes, but the baking went completely wrong so I went to a restaurant. 

Day 4: Today I first drove quite a long way, quite a few spelt bends but luckily it wasn't too bad in the end. After this I took a walk to a very beautiful waterfall, called staubifall. This one was very beautiful, and around it were even more waterfalls and very beautiful nature. Later I went to the next campsite, here I will stay for 2 nights.


Day 5: Today I did a long and hard hike to a viewpoint over lakes. Unfortunately it was quite cloudy, so the way there I didn't see much. Fortunately, I was able to see the lakes. I Was broken at the end of the day, because the way up was really tough.


Day 6: Today I left again for another campsite. Today I visited a waterfall and a cave, called st beatus caves. The rest of the day i didn't do much.

Day 7: Today I did another long hike, this one was to  Oeschinensee. The plan was not to do such a long one, but in the end the best route turned out to be longer. This again was quite a tiring route, with many paths going uphill. But it was worth it, it was so beautiful! Everywhere you look you see different things. I also took a very long time on the route, but mainly because I stopped a lot to enjoy  nature.


Day 8: Today I first went to the Lauterbrunnen. This is a valley with several waterfalls.  I did a short walk to trummelbachfalls. This was an underground waterfall, the water was really powerfull! In the afternoon I went to the city of bern, this was a nice city for a short while. I ate something and drunk a beer.

Day 9: Today I did a hike in a piece of nature just below the lauterbrunnen. This was a hike that was fairly uphill at times, but a lot less bad than other hikes. The nature here was really beautifully wild and changeable, i think one of the most beautiful of the whole trip. The starting point for this hike is at hotel & resteaurant stechelberg.

solotravel,1f6saj2,Cartagena or Bogota?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f6saj2/cartagena_or_bogota/,11,"Hi all, I’m tentatively planning a solo trip to Colombia for sometime next year - I plan to be there for a week and would like to do two cities. I’ve already basically decided that one of them will be Medellin, with a (guided) day trip to Guatapé and Piedra del Peñol. 

I can’t change the length of my trip due to work and other obligations - a week is all I get.

Originally I intended the second city to be Bogota, largely so I could do an outing to Guatavita and Zipaquira, but I’ve heard great things about Cartagena and I’m wondering if I should switch gears. I’m *very* early in the planning stages - nothing is booked yet - so it wouldn’t be hard to change the itinerary. 

If it helps, I’m much more of a “sights and culture” traveler than an “adventure” or “beach/resort vacation” traveler, though I do love being near water and out in nature.

This won’t be my first time abroad or even my first time in South America, and I do speak some Spanish (not fluent though). Travel time between cities is not a factor, but I don’t plan to rent a car.

Would you recommend Bogota or Cartagena?",2024-09-01 23:26:32

Hi everyone! I'm taking my first ever solo trip to NYC-also first time visiting NYC for my birthday September 21-24. I'm spending 3 nights but want some input on my itinerary, I'm trying to maximize my stay but not over do it to where I don't enjoy my stay. I arrive 3pm on the 21st and leave at 4pm on the 24th.

As for hotels I'm thinking either the Ludlow or the Marlton. I'm not too interested in staying in midtown or near Times Square, neither area appeals to me. I'm thinking Greenwich or the LES. Any recommendations of hotels in either area would be appreciated.

As for places I want to visit here is my running list:

* MET (9/22)
* MOMA(9/22)
* ~~Museum of natural history or the Guggenheim (9/22)~~
* Central Park (9/22)
* Albertine (9/22)
* Levain Bakery (9/21)
* Casey Rubber stamps(9/21)
* Niconeco zakkaya(9/23)
* SOHO shops(9/23)
* Pop up bagels (9/23)

Maybes:

* Broadway show: I'm thinking Hamilton ~~or the Notebook mostly likely~~on 9/22
* Brooklyn bridge
* ~~Whitney Museum~~

I feel like I'm missing a lot of must visit bars,restaurants or cafes, so please let me know of any y'all think are worth visiting please! 

I know staying in Greenwhich or LES will leave me staying further away from Central Park, MET etc so I ~~most likely will Uber back and forth. Might be open to public transit but do feel very nervous about getting lost especially at night.~~ Update: everyone’s been encouraging about the subway so will give it a try during the day!

I'm going solo travelling for the first time at the end of the month, visiting Athens, Greece. I've decided to go alone because I want to get away from it all and give myself a chance to reset, and following that logic, I don't really want to stay in a hostel. The ones I've looked at are more expensive than my other two options (WorkAway or an AirBnB), and I worry that it might be hard to get to sleep with all the noise.

I'm generally quite a chatty person but I'm a little concerned that I might struggle to make friends staying in an airbnb alone. I'm going to go on a tour for a few days near the end of the trip, so that'll probably help, and I've got a couple of walking tours planned of the city too. I'm now thinking I might go on a bar crawl at some point.

I've seen some people on here say the best of both worlds is to just visit a hostel or hostel bar in the evening and just pretend you're staying there. I'm a young person so I'll probably fit right in, but is this actually something many people do? And does it actually work?

Then I have another 18 days for Belize and Guatemala, but I am struggling big time to find a decent route. 

Some points I have to keep in mind: 
- I have to finish the Belize/Guatemala trip in Cancun as I’ve already booked my flight back home from there
- If possible, there are three must visits for me: Caye Caulker, San Ignacio, and Flores 
- To save time, I tried finding flights from Flores to Cancun. However they have about 1hr 45 minutes transfer time in Guatemala City and I am doubting whether this is long enough. 
- Alternatively, I would have to take shuttles or buses from Flores to Cancun, which seems to be possible but takes a lot of time (the ride itself but also borders controls?). 

My plan looks something like this now:
1. Cancun > Chetumal > Caye Caulker (travel)
2. Stay for a few days in Caye Caulker
3. Go on the Ragga Sailing Adventure (2 nights), end the trip in Dangriga and stay there for the night
4. Travel to San Ignacio, stay there for a few dats 
5. Travel to Flores, stay there for a few days
6. Question: how to get back from Flores to Cancun?

7. I heard that the water in Bali isn’t safe to drink, even in warungs. Is there any truth to that?
8. I’m staying around Seminyak—what are the best beach clubs? So far, I have Mexicola, La Favela, Finns, and Potato Head on my list. Are they worth it, or any other recommendations?
9. Lastly, should I book a Klook package with attractions or just rent a car with a driver?

I am planning a trip to Indonesia soon and I need to end up at Kuta Beach in Lombok after landing in Bali.

It is my first time in Peru, and I will have just under 3 weeks to visit. This felt like a lot when I booked it, but the more research I do, the more it seems like not enough time.

I feel pretty good about my plan for the first 10 days. I’ve been wanting to do the Salkantay trek for years, so that was the first thing I booked. For days 11-19, I have 3 different ideas that all appeal to me for different reasons. I would love feedback on any of the potential itineraries. 



Day 0: Flight arrives in Lima \~11PM. Make my way to hostel and SLEEP

Day 1: Explore Lima, eat ceviche

Day 2: Fly Lima to Cusco, time TBD

Day 3-5: Explore Cusco/Sacred Valley, acclimate to high altitude

Day 6-10: Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu (booked with Machu Picchu Reservations)

\*\*\*TBD

Day 19: Return to Lima from wherever I am

Day 20: Early morning flight home



\*\*\*For days 10-18, I have 3 different thoughts.

Option A (most likely option) - follow the “Gringo Trail” back to Lima

\~2 days Puno

\~3-4 days Arequipa (throw a Colca Canyon trek in here somewhere)

\~3-4 days Ica/Huacachina/Paracas



Option B (what I think I really want, but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea in November)

Day 11: Fly to Lima, bus to Huaraz

Day 12-18: Hang out in Huaraz and hike, doing either Santa Cruz Trek or a shortened version of Huayhuash Circuit – if anyone has any experience doing these hikes (especially in November) and/or recommendations for a tour operator, please let me know.



Option C (least likely and least thought out, but has a lot of appeal, especially since it will be spring there)

Day 11: Fly to Tumbes

Day 12-19: Make my way back to Lima with stops along the northern coast. Mancora, Chiclayo, Trujillo, etc. 



Any advice and/or experiences are much appreciated!

I'm in a bit of a predicament and could use some advice. My girlfriend of four years and I were supposed to move out of state together in just two days, but two days ago, she told me she doesn't want to go with me. She wants to move on her own. I'm not entirely blindsided by this, but I do feel pretty blindsided.

Now, I'm scrambling to figure out my next steps. I'm planning to move all my stuff out of our apartment in the next couple of days and either put it in a storage unit or take it to my parents' house, where I'll be staying for a bit.

Here's where it gets wild: I work remotely and can work from anywhere. My brother is about to leave on a three-month trip to Asia, starting in Japan. He's going with a friend initially, but after that, he'll be solo in places like Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan. I've been toying with the idea of spontaneously flying to Japan and staying there for a few weeks. I haven't planned anything at all—no accommodations, no itinerary, and I don't know any Japanese. But it seems cheaper to fly there than to other Asian countries, and it looks like there are safe, affordable hostels I could stay in. Japan just feels like a place where I could go without a plan and still have a meaningful experience.

If I were to go, I’d want to spend my time reflecting, walking around, exploring, reading, visiting bookstores, museums, and maybe even checking out some nature spots or Buddhist temples. I love running, so I'd also want to jog around different areas. I would love to meet people also traveling and make friends. I’m somewhat outgoing and relatively self-sufficient, but this trip would definitely put me out of my comfort zone—I've only been out of the country once, years ago.

Part of me feels like I might be intruding on my brother’s trip, even though I wouldn’t be staying with them. And honestly, I feel a bit weird about the idea of suddenly telling everyone that not only am I not moving out of state, but I’m also heading to Japan. It’s a huge shock to myself and probably to everyone else who knows me.

So, Reddit, what do you think? Should I take the leap and go to Japan, or am I just being impulsive? Any advice or experiences would be appreciated.

I’m planning my first solo backpacking trip and have chosen New Zealand (NZ) as my destination. I’m planning to go in February 2025 and will spend 25 days exploring both the North and South Islands.

I’ve been researching the best ways to travel around the country, but I’d love to get some advice from those who’ve been there.

One of the most common ways to backpack around NZ is by using hop-on-hop-off bus services. These buses have set itineraries, but you can ""hop off"" to explore places more in-depth and then ""hop on"" again later. However, I’ve read that during the high season, it can be tough to find available seats when you’re ready to move on, which could waste a lot of time.

The main service I’ve looked into is Kiwi Experience. The reviews are generally positive, but some people mention that it’s mostly a bunch of 18-20-year-olds getting drunk and going wild, which is how the buses apparently earned the nickname “Green F\*ck Bus.”

Another option is Stray, which seems to cater to a more mature crowd.

There’s also the Intercity Flexipass, which is cheaper and gives you more flexibility. However, with this option, I’d have to plan everything from A to Z myself (which I don’t mind).

Finally, some people have suggested renting a car or hitchhiking. Honestly, I don’t feel comfortable driving solo in a foreign country or hitching rides with strangers.

So, how do you think I should approach my trip? Should I go with Kiwi Experience, Intercity Flexipass, or something else?

A bit about me: I’m 23 years old, I love adventure, and I’m a bit of an adrenaline junkie. I’m not into mindless partying or ending up sick in a bathroom stall at 3 AM. I genuinely want to experience the country to the fullest in the time I have.

Thanks! <3

Update 1: Thanks everyone for replying. This subreddit is actually lit. Here is what I learned so far:

1. From what I gather, NZ seems to be a really chill place for travelers, and one should be worried about meeting new people, especially at hostels.

2. Intercity is a much cheaper option but requires more planning in advance.

3. Stray have their hop-on-hop-off services on hold, leaving us with the ""big green f*ck bus"" as our option.

I'll keep digging for reviews and whatnot and keep yall posted with what happens :)",2024-08-29 04:43:30

Trains. I'm an American and I love trains! Which is why York was on the list in the first place since I'll be passing through on my way to Edinburgh I believe. Is there anything train related I should know for my stay?

I am Indian, have lived in Switzerland for two years now for a postgrad program, and am the kind of traveller that enjoys doing conventionally 'boring' things in a different city. I love shopping for groceries and cooking meals in a new kitchen, identifying a favourite bookstore, taking public transport (I always make sure I have a little video of any new city I visit in which I can hear the mass transit announcements because I find them really charming), and having the kind of routine where I decide by the afternoon what I'll do in the evening. I'm also much more of a meandering walks, narrow alleys and old buildings kind of traveler than a night life, parties and active lifestyle one. Some of my closest friends belong to the latter category, and while I've occasionally enjoyed this, I absolutely cannot while travelling solo. 

I have some time free between the end of my studies and the expiry of my Swiss residence permit, with some money I've managed to hold on to from my part time work over the last year. I already ran off to Seville in peak summer heat, and spent 3 weeks travelling across Andalusia, and cannot overstate how marvellous an experience it was. I came back to Geneva feeling homesick for a city not even mine. 

I am now looking to install myself somewhere else in Europe between September 1 and September 11, before I come back to Geneva for my graduation, and I've been agonising for so long over this I thought I may as well outsource this to more seasoned travellers here. 

Option 1 is Salamanca. For the record I have a C2 certificate in Spanish, and am a trained teacher of Spanish as a foreign language (which is unrelated to my day job or my postgrad in Switzerland). This has meant that Spain has never felt difficult for me to navigate. For the longest time I wanted to move to Salamanca to study Spanish literature and philology at the university there, and I like that it isn't a 'mainstream' destination and therefore may be a little quiet. I thought of making day trips from there to nearby towns on a few days (Zamora, Valladolid et al), and just maybe spending my days walking around or lounging in a cafe in or around the old town. 

Option 2 is Naples. I've thought of going there ever since I got hooked on Elena Ferrante's novels based there, and I have never had a bad time travelling in Italy, albeit I've only ever been to the north (Bologna, Milan, Rome). I love the idea of discovering the city slowly, on foot, and getting to see the ruins of Pompeii or taking a boat to the nearby island. I do speak Italian as well, but as an obvious foreigner, and with a lot of 'interruption' by Spanish which is far and away the dominant Romance language in my head. 

Option 3 is Copenhagen. Apart from a couple trips to Paris and one trip to Reykjavik, I have only ever travelled southwards of Geneva in Europe. Aka, whenever I can afford to, I run off to either Italy or Spain or somewhere in nearby France. Copenhagen will therefore be a novel experience of Nordic Europe, albeit part of me wonders (because of friends who said this) if Copenhagen will feel 'just like' urban Switzerland, which objectively is a STUPENDOUS thing to feel like, but might defeat my purpose as a traveler. I have seen some photos, and I love the idea of walking along the waterfront, by the vividly coloured buildings. I speak zero Danish, albeit I understand this isn't much of an issue anywhere in Scandinavia.

Thanks in advance and hope you have a great day. 🌻 ",2024-08-29 07:46:15

* Do I need to pack a first aid kit?
* Do I need to pack a rain jacket? Or better to just buy a poncho once I'm there if needed. Hard to find a packable rain jacket that's affordable...
* I'm 36M from US (NYC). Would I stick out (in a bad way) if I opted to stay at any hostels? I have a partner but I'd like to meet other people and make friends.

I'm not a fan of birthday celebrations but this is the first time I'm celebrating on my own and I'm actually having a lot of fun. I woke up at sunrise on the beach, went snorkeling (very unsuccessful but I saw an elephant on the way, was worth the shot). Been surfing for a couple of hours and now I'm just walking on the beach. I was used to have a lot of people around me so I was a little worried to feel homesick on this day but actually I'm having a really good time.

Just booked flights for six days in Greece, will be flying in and out of Athens in the middle of September.

Just started sketching on an itinerary, this is my initial plan:

**1. Thursday - Saturday morning Athens**.

***Accomodation:*** ideally in a social hostel

***Activities:*** eat good food, explore the city, main sights and the nighlife a bit.

**2. Saturday morning - Monday morning Mykonos or equivalent (TBD).**

***Accomodation:*** ideally in a social hostel.

***Activities:*** Meet people, party and explore the island. I am more of a lively bar than a club person, so if someone has tips for another island with a lively nightlife and hostel scene but less club focused, please let me know.

**3. Monday morning - Wednesday morning Island X (TBD)**.

***Accomodation:***  hotel or quiet hostel.

**Activities:** recover and relax (ideally on a beach),  eat great food, go for some runs and maybe rent a scooter or ATV.

**4. Wednesday morning Back to Athens, lunch and to the airport.**

The main things I would like tips for are:

* Accomodation tips
* Restaurant tips
* Tips for a relatively quiet island with good food and beaches (part three of itinerary)
* Alternatives to Mykonos for a party friendly island
* Any improvements to the itinerary, e.g., if something is unrealistic timewise or could be done better
* General tips for what to do in Athens / any of the suggested Islands.

solotravel,1f3ggv3,Guatemala City ,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f3ggv3/guatemala_city/,9,"Landed on Saturday in Guatemala City on a $490 flight from Vancouver via United via Houston hub. Stayed at the America Hotel on the amazing park lined boulevard. I had no idea what to expect but hotel was definitely 60s porno esq but clean and no complaints about staff or anything. $80-90 a night. 
- coffee- let's not fuck around I googled straight away and came across (2) standouts 1. Torch Coffee company 2. El Injerto coffee. Both places have special coffee that cost 30-45 ($5-7) for special beans. Milk based drinks were average so go for black or their recommendation such as filter or pour over. These guys will out coffee any coffee nerd. 
- food - street meat is these little chorizo hotdogs sausages on hotdog bun. They were 20 each but I'm sure that's tourist prices $3. The best dishes I had with out doubt is prawn ceviche that came in about $20-30 but it was my food discovery. I did eat at Burpee Seafood that was expensive but great experience so can thoroughly recommend. I think I ordered lots and it was $60-70 (CAD). 
- Transport- used Uber and they have Uber motorcycle too if you're batshit crazy. 
- Antigue - spent one night at El Carmen hotel $80 (cad). Include breakfast. The town is as touristy as it gets so I decided to bail. Brewery was fun and decent stout. Not my thing but yes erupting volcanos are cool to see. 
- transport- bookaway had $12US rides in minivan to Antigua. Alternative is Uber that's about $65US. 
- safety- not going to lie in hotel district it's okay as so much security guards & police. I walked to rattle hum bar one night and everyone I passed would whistle up the street. Everyone in an area knows each other so I noticed it but just made me aware not to wander too far especially after too many. 
- next area I'll stay in is around the conquistador hotel as lots of cool restaurants and coffee shops there. That area feels very safe and everyone was friendly. 
- sim - bought data on airolo for $15US. 
Now I found cheap flight to Panama return so that's my next unplanned half assed trip. Anyone with points on Guatemala City or Panama City please comment. Especially coffee or unique food ",2024-08-28 17:44:07
solotravel,1f38t73,Working Holiday Visa NZ - overcoming my worries!,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f38t73/working_holiday_visa_nz_overcoming_my_worries/,32,"I didn't take a gap year after university. I'm close to turning 36 and also wasn't really conscious of the concept of working holiday. So, I mainly missed the boat for that as they generally seem to be for 18-30 year olds. I now regret that a little and have enjoyed bits of shorter travel since.

My country (the UK) have extended their working holiday visa agreement with NZ and Australia for people up to 35 years old. I'm thinking of taking the plunge and applying for the NZ one. 

For various reasons I wouldn't be able to get there and start using it imminently (though I plan to visit briefly, so would activate it within 12 months). That's lead me to think that I may as well apply for the longest 36 month visa and just get everything in place with one application fee. It does mean that I'll need a medical and police certificate which is an extra cost at this stage.

Anyway, I've started looking into it in depth over the past couple of weeks and its all made me a bit nervous. I find filling in forms and that kind of thing quite stressful, and what I'm essentially doing is applying for something and getting a medical etc etc when I'm not actually 100% sure that I will go through with it. Things happen, life changes. But its also the case that if I don't apply for it now I won't have the chance again. And I feel like I want to push myself out of my comfort zone a bit.

Firstly, is it legit to apply for the visa without knowing when I would go or how long I might end up staying (within the terms of that visa)? Or even having an idea of  whether I would work...potentially I could just save up and travel on a budget for a while). As far as I've read, all of the above is ok and is allowed as long as I have proof of funds whilst I'm there. I do tend to overthink these things though, and I'm getting visions of being stopped at the airport in 2 years time and being turned away for some reason.

Secondly, I guess I've come on here to (hopefully!) get a bit of a pep talk! People obviously don't always have a good experience of a working holiday it seems and I know NZ is expensive. Maybe I'll hate it and come back to the UK after a month. But if I don't get that application in now, I'll never get the chance to try and I'll never know (except going back and travelling as a tourist I guess). At least if I apply, I'll have the option for a few years in the future to decide whether I really would like give it a go.

Anyway, thoughts etc welcome! For info, I'm not considering the Australia one as I think you have to work for a certain amount of time to extend it beyond the first 12 months, and I can't guarantee I would actually be available to travel in that timeframe. ",2024-08-28 12:23:14

This will be my first time traveling solo outside the U.S., and for context, I am a 27-year-old Indian male. I've visited India with family many times, and my impression is that the ""vibe"" in the city, markets, and transportation is similar. Is that correct?



My itinerary for my 3-4 day stay in Nepal includes Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur, Shivapuri National Park, and possibly Nagarkot. I've created an itinerary using chatgpt that seems quite solid.



I'm looking to stay in a hostel with a party atmosphere since I enjoy meeting new people and am quite extroverted. Do you have any recommendations? So far, I've only considered Alobar1000.



Regarding Shivapuri National Park, is it necessary to have a guide for the hike, and is it safe to hike alone?



I'm interested in meditating and practicing yoga at temples. Is this a feasible option?



For transportation around the city and to nearby areas, should I seek out a specific taxi service, or is flagging down any taxi on the street adequate? What if I wanted to travel around the city on foot? I hear traffic can be an issue as a pedestrian. 



Are there any essential tours or activities that I should consider? Hiking, historical/cultural sites, and spiritual wellness are all interests of mine. Could you direct me to a website where I can explore these options to plan my activities? I have browsed viator so far. 



Additionally, since this is my first solo trip, I've read the sidebar for advice, but are there any insider tips or secrets you could share?",2024-08-28 16:55:37

Bad idea?,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f2vu3i/old_man_alone_on_the_oriental_express_good_idea/,44,"My Grandma recently died and my Grandpa has been feeling quite lonely & isolated. To combat these feelings, my 90 year old Grandpa decided he might like to take one last trip to Europe (we’re in the US). He wants to do the classic route from Paris to Istanbul. They had been to Europe about 7 times since the 1980’s so he’s familiar with regular travel around Europe, but he’s never had a chance to take this route as my Grandma wasn’t overly fond of long train rides, but Grandpa always loved them.

For an old man, he’s quite spry still and can move around as long as it’s slowly.  I offered to go with him ((with my 2year old baby)), maybe even just get him to the train in Paris and then i go sit on a beach in Italy for a few days with the baby & then meet his train in Istanbul and we can do the city together. That way he would have someone to fly with there & back home, but he would still get his Solo Adventure time.  

He does have the beginnings of slight confusion issues, but I figure once he’s on the train he should be good, right??? I would totally take the train trip with him but don’t think having a two-year-old running around all the train cars will be anyone else’s idea of fun (I would feel like we were ruining everyone else’s once in a lifetime trip).

For anyone who’s done it, does it sound like a feasible plan or is there a better way to go about it?

solotravel,1f3b8wu,Solo travelling Sri Lanka fun ?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f3b8wu/solo_travelling_sri_lanka_fun/,6,"
I'm debating going to Sri Lanka for 2 months end Oct till eind december, roughly 2 months. I was wondering what i can expect in terms of the backpacker vibes and hostels?

I heard a lot of couples are going to Sri Lanka and if that's the vibe I feel like it might not be my thing to go there solo wanting the average hostel backpacker vibe.

I've been almost everywhere with hostels in SEA and Europe and seen most of Central america so I've spent a good portion of my 20s backpacking and know every country has its own vibe.

I'm not a big party guy so it's good that I heard Sri Lanka isn't. I do however like meeting cool people and doing adventures together or hostels that put in work and organise fun activities etc.

In a nutshell help 😂
1. Will there be plenty solo backpackers (Nov/Dec)
2. What are the hostel vibes like ? (Age, activities etc)
3. Is 2 months overkill in Sri Lanka (alternatives with similar vibes closeby so I can split the 2 months? was thinking maybe goa but not sure that's my vibe either)

Cheers for the advice 😎 

Alternatively I could go to South America but that would be more expensive by a lot and it's so massive I'd feel like I wanna stay longer probably.

solotravel,1f2hp2i,What happened to Flix Bus? ,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f2hp2i/what_happened_to_flix_bus/,70,"I used them in 2019 and found them to be an affordable and comfortable way to travel around Europe (Germany, Czech, Austria and Switzerland). The worst that happened was that the bus may be delayed due to traffic, which is normal for any bus company. 

On my most recent travels around Europe I found them to be terrible! The buses did not have AC, the toilet was out of order and the seats were very uncomfortable since they contracted out to a local bus company. Not fun on a 5 hour bus journey!! 

Apparently seat reservations mean nothing as on multiple journeys I have found people sitting in my assigned seat. One of the reasons for this was that some of the seats that people booked did not exist on the bus, so they resorted to sitting in other people’s assigned seats. This causes a lot of confusion for everyone when trying to board a busy bus. 

Also on today’s journey from Zagreb to Ljubljana I’m 100% convinced that Flix Bus tried to scam me. I presented my ticket (which I bought directly) for scanning and they tried telling me that my ticket was invalid and that I needed to pay for a separate ticket. I had my ticket open in the Flix Bus app and it showed Zagreb to Ljubljana for today’s date. It’s only after I kicked up a stink that they let me board the bus. Disgraceful behaviour.

Save yourself the hassle and use trains instead!

It was well reviewed, though comments mentioned it was self service, with no staff out of hours.

I check in, and yep, no staff, which I was expecting. 

I’m met with a man that is middle-aged and shirtless.  No problem here yet. I’m new to solo travel, but not new to hostels. 

Except this guy is obviously drunk, extremely intense, and very very off. I text my friends who advise me to leave, but I’ve paid in full, so I stay. We’re the only two in the room the first night.

The next day a girl checks in from Poland. Important to the story is I’m a man. This older bloke spends all day in the room just sitting shirtless. Me and the woman chat a bit, but it’s unnerving to have this silent bloke in the corner.

Cut to the night, and the polish lady has slept early as she’s only just got in. The man comes over to me and shows me a badly Google translated note on his phone asking to talk downstairs, away from the woman. My alarm bells are ringing.

We go downstairs and he try’s to explain he wanted me to have a better experience with the internet while I was working on my laptop. I asked him to cut the shit. He then admitted he wanted to be alone with the girl, and if I could stay downstairs for an hour. THIS GIRL IS UPSTAIRS ASLEEP. 

I go upstairs, pack my things, tell the girl what happened. The old bloke yells he isn’t a bad guy and he has made a mistake.

Priority is the nature, volcano/mountain hikes, forest.. one option to fly to Medan and make my way to Jakarta(fly out) or start in Jakarta and make my way to Banda Aceh. But from there how to get to Malaysia or Thailand? Is there any ferries?
Any good interesting spots to visit there, 
Lake Toba will be priority. 
I already been to in Java (did some travel in jakarta, bandung, and surrounding places,  surabaya,ijen volcano, and ofc bali, so no interest to go there. 
Any experience? Any interesting places to visit there? 
Plan to land with e-visa for 30 days and after extend for 30 more days

solotravel,1f24jsf,Please critique my tentative solo London itinerary!,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f24jsf/please_critique_my_tentative_solo_london_itinerary/,66,"Hi, so I'm going to London for the first time in October! I'll have about a week there before heading off to Paris to meet up with family. I've put together a rough outline of what I'm planning to do, and would love some suggestions about what to do/see/eat etc.!

About me:

* Solo female traveler, early 30s. I've done a decent amount of traveling and feel comfortable going solo.
* Things I enjoy: Walking around pretty neighborhoods, exploring markets, vintage/antique/charity shops, and book stores, eating great food, nice views, parks, river walks and cruises, nature, theater shows and musicals, and some museums or historical sites (heavily depends on the topic)
* Things I don't enjoy or care to spend time on: anything around royalty or the royal family, churches (unless really amazing architecture), clubbing/nightlife
* Travel style: I like to have a semi-structured plan going into the trip, meaning that I have outlines for the general areas I plan to visit each day, with a few time-specific and pre-scheduled outings, but also plenty of time for just some general exploring and wandering.
* Budget: I think I'd say mid-range - I try to stay on the cheaper end of things, but I am willing to pay extra if it saves me time and makes things simpler. I only want to pay for the things I'm truly interested in, but will also try out free activities.
* Food/Drink: I am vegetarian, so that limits things a bit. I love Indian, Italian, Thai, Greek, Chinese, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean food. I am also adventurous with trying new food and would welcome suggestions outside the options I listed! I like staying on the casual side of things with restaurants for the most part. I plan to do a few sit down dinners or lunches at restaurants that require reservations, but mostly go for casual places or takeaway. I always like to try out some of the local/national chain restaurants everywhere I travel as well - I know its not the best food but I like the experience! Right now I have Wagamamas and Pizza Pilgrims on my list of potential options. I love coffee and would like to go to some cute and interesting coffee shops. I am also a huge ice cream fan and would like some suggestions for the best ice cream in London! I do like beer and drinking in general, but considering I'll be solo I don't plan on getting drunk or doing any real partying.
* Other: I make it a point while traveling to always check out grocery stores! I just find it really interesting to see what is and isn't available, and buy some cheap new snacks to try. I like pharmacies and convenience stores as well. I have Sainsburys, Tesco, Waitrose, and Boots on my list right now.

I'm staying in a small hotel near Kensington and Notting Hill. The closest tube station is Bayswater. I plan on using public transportation for the majority of the trip, but may book a taxi or uber if I have time constraints or have to go a decent distance with luggage.

I plan to go to at least one West End show or musical, more if I can! I'll be looking for the rush and lottery tickets so I'm keeping most evenings of my trip flexible and open in case I get last minute tickets.

Itinerary:

* Day 0 (Saturday)
   * Land at Heathrow around noon. Take the tube into the city and check in to my hotel.
   * Get a small meal or snack in Notting Hill (right now I have my eye on De Nadas Empanadas)
   * Explore Notting Hill and Portobello Road. Check out markets, shops, bookstores, etc.
   * Get dinner somewhere nearby.
   * Back to the hotel to go to bed fairly early so I can be ready for a full day tomorrow!
* Day 1 (Sunday)
   * Get coffee and small breakfast near the hotel
   * Start my solo walking tour of some of the major attractions by heading through Hyde Park, then seeing Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben. I'm not planning to go in or buy tickets to any of these places, I just want to see them from the outside!
   * Cross Westminster Bridge and walk east along the waterfront, check out the London Eye (I'm not interested in riding it)
   * Continue along the waterfront to Borough Market and get some lunch.
   * Head over to Tower Bridge. I'm undecided about just crossing it or actually buying a ticket. The thing that interests me the most is the view from the glass walkways, but unsure if that is worth the price of the ticket.
   * Cross the bridge and go to Tower of London. I know I have to get a ticket ahead of time for this one, so I'll adjust my previous plans as I go to make sure I get here at the correct time. I'm thinking 2pm, as I plan to start out pretty early in the morning. I'd love to get the official beefeater tour.
   * Continue on to Sky Garden, if I can get a ticket. I know they're released 3 weeks ahead of time, but do they really get snatched up in a matter of minutes? If so I'll try my best to be ready at the right time.
   * Get dinner somewhere nearby or on the way back to the hotel.
* Day 2 (Monday)
   * Coffee and breakfast near the hotel
   * Solo walk through Little Venice and Regent's Park to Camden Market
   * Explore Camden Market and the general area. Eat lunch at the market or somewhere nearby if hungry.
   * Maybe check out the view from Primrose Hill
   * Take the tube to Hampstead, check out the general area.
   * Get a snack or treat and head into Hampstead Heath, if its not raining I'll bring a blanket and my Kindle and probably chill here for a bit. Explore the park a bit as well.
   * Dinner somewhere nearby or on the way back to the hotel.
* Day 3 (Tuesday)
   * Day trip, TBD. There's so many options and I can't decide!
* Day 4 (Wednesday)
   * Coffee and breakfast near the hotel or somewhere on the way down through South Kensington or Chelsea. Will depend on if I walk or take the tube.
   * Walk or tube to Chelsea, get on one of the clipper boats at Chelsea Harbour or Cadogan.
   * Take the boat to Greenwich.
   * Will probably do the Observatory, and I want to see the prime meridian line.
   * Explore Greenwich - park, market, get lunch somewhere.
   * Take the boat or tube back into Central London.
   * Rest of the afternoon/evening is TBD. Maybe a museum? I'm not totally sold on some of the museums, I'm just not sure if I'll find them interesting enough to be worth the time and price. However I have not done enough research to fully decide.
   * Dinner near wherever I end up
* Day 5 (Thursday)
   * Day trip, again TBD.
* Day 6 (Friday)
   * Coffee and breakfast near hotel
   * Take the tube to Richmond
   * Explore Richmond (I'm a Ted Lasso fan so I want to see some of the sights, but I don't need or want to do a private tour)
   * Lunch in Richmond
   * Take the tube back into Central London.
   * Again, the rest of the afternoon/evening is TBD. This is my last full day so I might use this time to hit up any sites or areas that I didn't think of before arriving in London. Might hang around and explore Marylebone, Soho or Covent Garden since I haven't explicitly planned to see those areas yet.
   * Dinner wherever, then back to hotel
* Day 7 (Saturday)
   * Get up nice and early to check out of the hotel and make my way to St. Pancras!

Am I missing any must-see attractions or neighborhoods? Am I being too ambitious with time or maybe not ambitious enough? If you've taken the time to read through this giant post I truly appreciate it and would love any advice or suggestions!",2024-08-27 01:03:41
solotravel,1f2m70w,Lake Louise Daytrip in Layover,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f2m70w/lake_louise_daytrip_in_layover/,6,"I’m studying abroad in Ireland next week and on the weekend I’m flying in. I booked with Skiplagged and I took the longest plane possible to get in the cheapest (which was stupid) but I’m going from Chicago to Seattle to Calgary to Ireland. Almost 3 whole days not even counting when I get to Ireland. Overall, even though it might take a very long time and seem stressful I did it earlier this summer when I was coming back from Japan. I got the chance to go to Hawaii and Las Vegas before going back home which was super sick. Even though I might be losing days it’s just a cool fun thing for me but something that really stuck with me was banff/lake Louise. I’ve wanted to go there for years and I’m layovering in Calgary for about 11 hours during the day. Is this a bad idea to go out thru immigration and walk around the lake for a little bit? I’ve been trying to strategically trying to plan it but it’s almost no use. I can’t rent a car because it says I’m too young and a lot of the lines like the Brewster doesn’t give me enough time because of the commute. Does anyone have ideas or things I should do or if this is just stupid? ",2024-08-27 17:01:02

I have only two week off work so i see all the combination to go for doing the dias in Mexico City and Yucatan.

At the end i found good flight for the period 1-17 November, the problem is that the first of November i will arrive in Mexico city at 22:55, i think is too late.

In your opinion how much stuff i will miss? I know that the Dia is the 2 of November, but i see that there are parade and stuff on the first so for me it's a big problem.

But coming early it's 300€ more than this flight.

However what do you think? The 1 of November really deserve too be seen entirely?

After that i will leave mexico city and i'm choosing beetween going right away to Yucatan and stay there until 17 November, but 13days there aren't too much? 

Going to oaxaca 2-3 days and after yucatan, or going right away to yucatan but take the return flight before and do 3-4 days in Guatemala or Cuba (because i see good and cheap flights).

What do you recommend? I'm losing my mind.

The other two option was going the 17 of October to Cancun and return the the 3 of November from Mexico city or going 26 of October to Cancun move to Mexico city the 31 October but after i will leave the 10 of November so from 3-4 Novemebr to 10 i don't know where to go.

solotravel,1f1v8tf,My incredible experiance hitch hiking around Norway,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f1v8tf/my_incredible_experiance_hitch_hiking_around/,2,"Went hitch hiking solo around Norway in 2022 for a couple of weeks and it was such an awesome adventure that I wanted to share the story, so buckle in because theres lots to tell!

  
So after some time in Oslo I hit the road with the rough idea of getting to Bergan in the West but with hitch hiking you can never really be sure of where you'll end up so I had no real plans set in stone. I first caught a ride with a father and son who were on their way to their very own cabin to make some renovations. They took me a decent way and a got another short lift after. My last lift of the day was with a young Polish couple who had rented a mini and spoke almost 0 English. Together we drover through the astounding scenery that Norway has to offer, over mountains, through tunnels, across rivers and fjords, I was speechless. We drove for a long time and as I had no data I really didn't have a clue where I was by 11pm when they dropped me off in the town of Øvre Årdal. It was dark and raining so setting up camp wasn't too appealing of an idea.I stood around studying my map for 5 minutes before an older lady came to speak with me. Incredibly after just 5 minutes of conversation in slighly broken English I was invited to stay with her which I simply couldn't refuse. We reached her home and I met her confused but very friendly husband who promtly offered me a beer, some wine and coffee as well as food and chocolate, next thing I know I'm wrapped up ina  comfy bed in the warmth and reflcetcing on the madness of the day. Day 1 was simply a sign of things to come...

  
Fast forward a few days and I've been camping in Songdal and it's been georgeous. It was time to move on though so I was back on the road. At this point I was loving the unknown and havng a plan was really the last of my concern. I caught a lift fairly quickly with a Portugese dude called George. He was pulling a trailer of stuff to his new home he was moving into. After a little converstaion George made me an offer ""If you help me move these boxes into my new place I'll make you a coffee, we can chill out and then I'll take you to the ferry port you're heading too"". Of course I accepted and next thing I know I was helping George move into his stunning new property with a view of the fjord that I'll never forget. We even had a chance to meet his new neighbor who was very confused and emused when George explained that I am not the new resident but instead a random vagabond who was roped into a quick but of labour. We had some great conversations and true to his word George took me to where I was trying to get. Great way to break up the day.

  
After getting stuck in the town of Vik, meeting more incredible people and spending my birthday in Bergan I was back to the roads to get to Stavanger, the oil capitol! After 3 rides and very decent progress I caught the final ride of the day all the way there with a gentleman called Knuk. It was a pleasure to chat a drive with the guy and he went above and beyond by buying me some food and giving some great recommendations along the way, the perfect kind of person really. We arrive in Stavanger at 9pm and I immediately went in search of some wifi. I ended up finding a little restraunt bar and asked the chef outside if I could grab a beer and use the wifi. He was super friendly and interested in my little journey and shared his own stories of the road. I sat at the bar and the beers kept flowing. The atmosphere was incredible and without asking I was presented with the best fish and chips I have ever eaten in my lifetime (Sorry England but this truely has us beat). The company of Roy and Fenny at the bar was wonderful and I felt so privilaged to have been welcomed with such warmth and enthusiasm. They even let me stay after closing time since I had nowhere to be and we were all enjoying it so much. After 5 beers, a plate of fish and chips, 2 soft drinks and an ice cream it was time to pay up and be off but the the entire meal was paid for by the staff. They didn't want a penny and I was left again speechless by the generosity and warmth of the incredible peopl e of Norway. I said my farewells practically with a tear in my eye and made for my camping spot. While setting up my hammock another 2 beers rolled out of my bag which they had snuck in while I was in the toilet. You just can't make this up. I spend alot of that night awake in a weird state of bliss and ecstasy at how this journey was unfolding. After a beautful hike to Pulpit Rock the next day (where Mission Impossible - Fallout was filmed) I returned to the restraunt to express my gratitude and this time pay for a meal which again, did not dissapoint. Some of the best food I have ever had in my lifetime. The next day I even managed to meet a local on couchsurfing and ended up staying on his boat which was moored up just 5 minutes away from where I'd been camping which was wild.

  
Khristansand was the last place I'd be visiting on this journey and honestly I was sure things would wind down by this point but not on this journey. I managed to get a ride in a campervan with Olga a devout Christian with her 3 dogs. She said that God had asked her to stop for me so cheers G I owe ya one. We lhad a wonderful journey and despite her only intending to take me half way when a nasty storm rolled in she just went ahead and took me the whole way despite it being out of her way. In Kristiansand I bought a ferry ticket to Denmark for the following morning and decided I would have a nice meal to see the trip out and get an early night in. Firstly at the restraunt the waiter was very kind and after hearing my story he gifted me a blanket, beer and bag of snacks so that was more kindness out of nowhere. Finally I was on my way to a campspot to end the night when a stranger called me over from a bar. It was a busker that I had walked past earlier. he had noticed my big bag, realised I was a traveller and immediatly invited me to join him and his friends for a drink. 10 minutes later he invited me to stay on his sofa for the night and spend the night drinking with him and the gang, you really can't make this up. And so that's exactly what we did. We moved onto another bar where I chatted with the bar man who gave me a free glass and said ""Welcome to Norway!"". We went to a few more places before back to his house to drink some wine and chat until 4am. Norway just had to finish with some style.

  
The next morning a boarded my ferry in a daze and watched from the deck as this wild land of spontanious adventure and kindness faded away. There were so many other little stories in between all of this and it's lead to Norway being pretty much number 1 of all my trips. If you get the chance you should visit and see what this womderful land has to offer, you really won't be dissapointed!

  
Thanks for reading yo, hope this inspired some people to visit and go on an adventure, can't say you'll be dissapointed!",2024-08-26 18:20:05

solotravel,1f22ixv,10 day trip itinerary to Guatemala ,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f22ixv/10_day_trip_itinerary_to_guatemala/,11,"Hola! I'm in the early planning stage of a solo trip to Guatemala in November. This will be my first time in Guatemala and Central America. My Spanish is pretty rudimentary (from what I learned in high school, haha), but I plan on practicing it a bit before the trip.

I'm trying to build in enough time in each destination to avoid constantly moving and be able to take in everything. Also planning to stick to public transit/planes to get around.

My goal for the trip is to see nature and hike, visit historical sights while wandering around, and keep the days somewhat open to meet people in hostels/locals. I'd like to go out some nights as well, but I'm not making that the primary focus of the trip as I don't want to sightsee hungover!

I also love things relating to local shops, parks to walk around, and the history of the area.

Here's my itinerary work-in-progress:

1. Fly into Guatemala City - Transfer to Antigua
2. Antigua
3. Antigua
4. Antigua - Acatenango hike 
5. Return from Acatenango hike - Antigua
6. Antigua to Atitlan 
7. Atitlan 
8. Atitlan 
9. Atitlan to Guatemala City 
10. Fly home

- I'm trying to limit my trip to 2 main base hostels with day trips. But if there are any better places to stay, I'm open to suggestions!

- I’ve heard Tikal is incredible but don’t want to stretch myself too thin with a long bus ride. Would you include it in this trip or would it be better with a north Guatemala/belize trip? 

- Any other suggestions are much appreciated to improve my itinerary. Thanks!

I’m looking forward and hoping to visit this beautiful country soon! ",2024-08-26 23:28:07
solotravel,1f2az0i,Spending 8-9 days in Tokyo (mid October) as a first time solo Japan traveller.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f2az0i/spending_89_days_in_tokyo_mid_october_as_a_first/,5,"Hi there, as the title says I’m planning to go to Japan for the first time ever solo (around October 14th) for probably around 8 days. I’ve decided to stay just in Tokyo, and will go to Osaka, Kyoto etc the next time I’m in Japan with my friends instead of solo. I’ve been reading a lot through reddit and just trying to look through video content online to try and prepare as much as possible, but I have just begun. I have a lot more content yet to consume but figured since I’m on here anyway, might as well shoot a post on here to get some advice from all the kind, seasoned vets.

I’ve seen some general tips like: bringing cash, a hand towel, hand sanitizer etc. Getting the train pass (Suica) for public transportation. It’s either the physical copy or digital copy which you can load using Apple Pay correct? Any recommendations on which route to go?

Some things about me: I am a male, love anime, baseball (sadly won’t get to catch a game at Koshien Stadium because of the timing 😭). I do enjoy city life, I would consider myself quite outgoing as well, and good at socializing and getting along with others. I was thinking about booking to stay in a hostel or something so that I could meet other people travelling to Japan and potentially find some cool, like-minded people to hangout with while there. I do rather enjoy talking and being with people instead of being alone the whole time.
I love artsy type places and would like to get extremely cool photos of myself or just aesthetic photos in general. 
(Tl;dr I love anything related to sports, fitness, anime, art, outgoing and socializing events, music)

I’ll definitely be checking out Shibuya to see all the damage done there during the incident (JJK reference). Maybe there’s some must see spots related to One Piece, JJK, AoT etc? I do recall there being a One Piece gym or something. 

Is it possible to just plan some things out and then try to wing some of it? Or would it be a grave mistake in terms of efficiency to try and wing it exploring around? Since I’m going solo I know that I must try and plan and research as much as possible so that I’m not stressed or anything while I’m there. Would love to hear some insight from fellow travellers and lovers of the Japanese culture. I’ve been wanting to go since 2005 so it’s safe to say I’m pretty hyped. Also, it’d be cool to know if it was easy to make friends while out there as well (whether they’re from Japan, or travel groups, etc.)",2024-08-27 07:14:17
solotravel,1f1w20v,Trip Report: One Week in San Francisco,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f1w20v/trip_report_one_week_in_san_francisco/,18,"I just love the Bay Area and so recently went on a short trip out there.  Now the first few days were with a group of friends, but the last several I stayed solo so hopefully this is allowed!  San Francisco gets a lot of bad press in the US media, but here's the good, the bad, and the, well... the really good:  (and btw, if you want to see some pictures, feel free to click on my profile since I posted a bunch in r/travel)

\* **Muir Woods**:  This is a must do, as the redwoods are so majestic and smell wonderful.  I did a full day hike through there, mainly around what is referred to as the Bootjack Loop (\~1000 foot elevation gain and \~7 miles so a nice hike but nothing crazy).  I'd recommend it as you get out of the busy valley with the boardwalks.  The smell of the redwoods is just so invigorating.

\* **Fisherman's Wharf**:  Not a huge fan as its very touristy, but I always go to watch the sea lions and they never ever disappoint.  I could sit there all day, I sware

**\* Alcatraz**:  Such a unique tour, and the self-guided portion through the prison is very well done.  Makes me want to watch ""Escape from Alcatraz"" again with Clint Eastwood.  But even better is just meandering throughout the whole island.  The views and gardens and old buildings make for such a cool experience.

\* **Coit Tower:**  I paid to go to the top of the tower because I was there, but there's nothing up there you can't equally see from Telegraph Hill.  The hike up from North Beach to the top is the really cool part, as there's two really neat sets of steps up.  Filbert Steps to me were cooler than the Greenwich Steps, but both worthy of doing.

**\* Presidio**:  I had never hiked through there before.  It feels like the natural vibes from down in Monterrey, but without the long drive down.  I hiked down to Marshall's Beach and all along the coast

\* **Golden Gate Bridge**:  From the Presidio I went over the Golden Gate on foot (maybe better on bike?) but I hiked up to the overlook and saw a bobcat or something fairly large up there prowling around!  It was mostly fogged in the day I did this but still beautiful.

\* **Golden Gate Park**:  So much to see here and I only saw a fraction.  The Japanese Tea Garden is super touristy but well-done and I had some great Mochi enjoying the peaceful views.  I still love walking over the Moon Bridge.  The Botanical Gardens are super cool and almost empty.  The fragrance garden in there was one of my favorites.  Strawberry Hill is a beautiful little walk to the top and then down through the wooden bridges.  The rose garden was also in full bloom.  

**\* Cable Cars:**  I did the Hyde-Powell Street line which has the best views (but it was also kind of stupid because I waited for an hour at the far north end).  Also did the California line with zero wait.  This is one of the coolest most unique things to do.  Sit near the driver so you can see him manually operating the cables & brakes.

\* **Lombard Street**:  I don't know, I find it super cool to walk down!

\* **Food**:  So many great sushi places, plus the hot pot spots; pretty much all Asian food is my kryptonite 

\* **Walking Tour:**   I did a cool walking tour through the Mission/Castro districts and saw a lot of really cool stuff and history.  Enjoyed it!

**\* Tenderloin District / Homelessness / Crime**:  I saw a really great city everywhere I went.  I did have dinner one night in the Tenderloin district just to see what the fuss was all about or if SF's troubles were TOTALLY made up.  And yea, this district was not great.  Drug use was definitely not super hidden, I didn't feel very safe and I wouldn't park my car there.  But also nothing happened to me, and no one so much as approached  me.  So if you want to have an abundance of caution stay out of that central area.

(for completeness here's my non-solo stuff)

\* **Napa Valley**:  This was done with my group of friends.  We went to this crazy winery tour called ""Own your own vineyard"" which is run by the literal founder of wine.com.  One person in the party has to buy vines in his vineyard for $120, and then your a vineyard owner so you and your party basically can chill with him and taste all his wines.  Literally the cheapest (for a group) and most fun way to do this

**\* Oakland Coliseum**:  This was the reason for the friends trip, as we wanted to go see a game before they tore it down.  It's a real shame for Oakland fans.  The stadium is not nearly as bad as I was imagining it, but the surroundings were worse.  Not a safe feeling city at all!",2024-08-26 18:51:56

solotravel,1f2684z,12 Days in Guatemala - Advice ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f2684z/12_days_in_guatemala_advice/,4,"Hi there!

I'm (M29) Planning to spend 12 days (Nov 5-16/17) in Guatemala. This will be my first time in Central America. I have solo travelled about 5 other times mostly in Europe and a few times in the USA and Singapore. 

I've done some research and this is the itinerary that I have came up with.

Nov 5 - Arrive into Guatemala City and take a shuttle to Antigua.   
Nov 5-9 - Antigua. Plan to take the overnight Acatenango hike.  
Nov 8-12 - Lake Atitlan  
Nov 12-15 Flores 

I have one or two more spare days. Can anyone give me advice where to fit this? Is there somewhere near Flores that is worth spending a night or two at? I considered Semuc Champey but I don't do well on long bus rides.   
  
I'm also considering to spend 1 or 2 nights in Mexico City as I will connect through there. I was thinking to knock off a day somewhere in my current itinerary and fit in Mexico City at the start of my trip for two nights. Not sure if Mexico City has a good hostel/solo experience?|

Appreciate any tips!",2024-08-27 02:26:18
solotravel,1f1rpie,Solo young Female international travel,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f1rpie/solo_young_female_international_travel/,3,"When I was 28 ,I went to Mexico , that was my first real solo international trip and although I had fun, it was rough and I came back looking more tired than I left. I said I would never do solo international travel again.

 I was 29 and woke up one day like Elle Woods and decided to go to Shanghai. I was having the most stressful time at work, to the point I had gotten sick (I still went to work). I had absolutely no idea what it entailed to get to shanghai, but for some reason I was committed. I tried to find friends to go with, but it never worked out and eventually I realized that I would actually rather go alone. I did not want to worry about planning/ coordinating with someone else and in all honesty, I was just exhausted. I booked a private, personalized tour on my own. (\~$1300 USD) I read reviews on reddit and the internet and the place seemed reputable. \*It was.

Anyway, despite how confusing and costly it was to get a VISA, navigating the Chinese firewall, and coordinate a trip from the SE of USA to Shanghai, I persisted because work had made me miserable, and this helped me dream. I ended up spending about 5 full days in shanghai. I'm black and speak no Mandarin beyond ""thank you"" and ""hello."" 

Its a few months post- trip and I am so happy I went. I don't regret a thing. Its crazy because I usually have yearning to travel somewhere new, but lately I have been feeling more content and not sure where to go next. I want to use my VISA to China, but I have 10 years. I think I will actually try to learn some Mandarin before though.  Everyone was so confused why I went to Shanghai, and honestly, I don't have an answer but anyway it was worth it. 

If you want to go somewhere, just make it happen.

* Health Insurance: Any recommended health insurance providers that I could get as a supplemental insurance to cover me while traveling ?
* Payments : I have seen mixed things about connecting a US credit card to alipay, would wechat work better? What would be the best option here?

I am a slow traveler and I work remotely so I pretty much worked and walked on their beautiful streets whenever I got the chance. I have never been in love with a city as much as I loved Almaty. The entire city is covered in the most beautiful parks, the weather is perfect, people are friendly. Everyone is out on the streets by evening (with their kids, families, friends) - laughing, having fun, enjoying their coffees. Its truly a sight to behold. Over the weekend, I went to the mountains, canyons and my eyes could legit not register the beauty. I also stayed at this amazing capsule hotel where I met amazing people (even had a little fling hehehe) - some within KZ and some travellers. I made very good friends with a fellow female traveller and had a blast the last few days. Now that I am back I feel so heavy - not in a good way. Most of the times I think of what would I be doing had I been in Almaty now. I feel like going back ASAP - I honestly can since I work remotely anyway.

I'm super excited for the length of my stay which is most likely, a couple of days. I feel like the adrenaline rush makes me develop crushes really easily. A couple of years ago, it happened in Prague and last week, something similar happened. I met someone I have gotten to know during my stay in Prague. He lives in Belgium, showed me around the city he lives in, we had plenty of fun and weirdly, I suddenly felt really attracted and emotionally connected to him. It's only been a couple of hours. Unfortunately, I got really drunk (I rarely drink, haven't eaten much and let's say my anxiousness about getting closer to him and also maybe my intuition that that's not going to happen, made me want to drink). 

At the end of the night, I asked him if i could kissed him, he declined because he is seeing someone else. Absolutely understandable. After saying goodbye and a few texts, I knew, that's it. It's probably better that way , even if we did become intimate, it's pretty unlikely that something more would develop due to the circumstances and also, that we're not quite a good match relatinship wise. It would only make me suffer. Anyway, I cannot stop thinking about him. No matter if it's the hormones, the special time we shared together, the fact that a relationship is impossible, it's an attachment I don't really comprehend and really struggle with.

The dog than followed me, when I stopped to give him some pets he got a bit too excited and hugged my leg pretty tightly and was playfully snapping at my pants (they are flowy pants). He kept doing this when I slowed down or stopped walking.

I knew it was playful behavior but it still freaked me out since I didn't want to be (accidently) bitten and be 2 hours deep in the jungle alone. So I decided to calmly walk back to the main road till he lost interest (firmly saying 'NO' had no effect). I didn't feel comfortable scaring it away because I thought he could bite as a defense(?).

What do you do in such situations? Do you scare away the dog (and how) or just keep doing what you're doing and ignore it?

I am not worried about Rabies since there have been 0 cases of rabies here, Cameroon highlands, for multiple years (they say 30+ years). That's why I felt comfortable interacting with the dog + I saw others petting him.",2024-08-25 09:03:51

Hope you all are doing well.

After 2 years of slogging day and night, saving up my vacation days and every penny - I’m finally down to planning my next solo trip. I’ve shortlisted Spain + Portugal + Morocco for March & April 2025. 

Need all your expert advice to nail the itinerary: 

Valencia -> Cordoba -> Granada -> Sevilla -> Lagos -> Lisbon -> Madeira -> Porto -> Bilbao -> Madrid -> Marrakesh -> Merzouga -> Fes -> Chefchaouen -> Tetouan -> Tangier -> Rabat -> Casablanca -> Barcelona

1. Cordoba is for a night as the connectivity from Valencia to Granada was bad via Cordoba. It saves me the hassle of doing it as a day trip from Sevilla and also I get to spend the evening there in a less crowded city. 
2. Similarly, Rabat is also for a night as from Tangier to Casablanca is via Rabat. 
3. **Questions:** How will the weather in Sevilla be during mid-March? Reading mixed info online. Any input or references will be greatly appreciated. How will the weather in Madeira be during the end of March? Reading mixed info online. Any input or references will be greatly appreciated. 
4. Any good recommendations for the dessert experience from Marrakesh to Fes?
5. I’m planning to hire a motorcycle in Madeira. Any thoughts on how the road condition will be?
6. Pico do Arieiro vs Ponta de São Lourenco - which one would recommend and why?
7. Is 3 full days more than enough to cover Marrakesh? I was planning to do a day trip to Essaouira on one of the days.

Thanks all for your comments. I think a few misread/I wasn't clear enough, I HAVE travel insurance, however I'm asking if anyone has any experience of actually claiming on it.

Lots of people assume insurance is fine but find in reality it's not, despite checking the small print to a non-professional level.

Anyone who's had to claim on insurance for other things (car, home etc) will know how, despite reading the small print, they often don't payout in full and I'm wondering what the situation is with health insurance when US people seem to routinely face huge costs despite having much more expensive insurance.

I appreciate this is low risk, but I don't want to risk bankrupting my family in anyway when there are a million other countries to visit.

If anyone's ACTUALLY had a health issue in the US (traffic accident, broken leg etc) AND claimed on their local insurance/found it's not an issue (rather than just assuming it will be fine), I'd be keen to hear, but otherwise it seems it's worth attempting and trying to flee the country if it becomes a problem.

Original:

Hi,

A bit of an odd question...

I (UK, 40s) have travelled a lot, however haven't been to the USA for 20 years (previously visited on 4 occasions).

I am very healthy, but do have high blood pressure, controlled through taking one minor medication.

I have a visit booked to New York (city) for 5 days and about a month ago bought a reasonably high end/recognised brand travel insurance package (registering the exact details of my blood pressure) including health for the US for about £30/$40 (there were lower cost options I noted)

Now reading more and more about how horrific the state of medical care is in the US (people being routinely bankrupted by costs even with US/employment insurance), I'm wondering if it's worth the risk as a tourist and if I should cancel my visit...

I just can't understand how people will pay huge amounts in health insurance and still face eye-watering costs, yet magically my £30 will stop that if (god forbid) something happens to me...

I'm obviously not planning on having any health issues/accidents in my 5 day visit, but it is feeling like a gamble as the costs I'm seeing people face would literally destroy my life.

I'm wondering how people feel about this and (specifically) if anyone has had an accident in the US (eg a broken leg or similar) and their UK travel insurance has meant they're not financially destroyed from it?",2024-08-26 16:11:27

solotravel,1f085uk,Algeria Solo Report,259,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f085uk/algeria_solo_report/,124,"Hello all!

I just came back from 2 weeks in Algeria. I am younger (early 20s) male, solo traveler from the US, and wanted to both provide an outside perspective on the beautiful country and also be a resource for people planning similar things. Algeria may be my favorite country of the 30 I've visited.

I saw Algiers, Oran, Tlemcen, Ghardaia, Constantine, Annaba, Batna, Timgad before going to Tunis.

Oran and Annaba were likely my favorite cities; something about the beauty of the architecture on the coasts and incredibly friendly people was amazing. Not a single place I didn't like, including Batna which people said was going to be boring. Everyone in the country I felt welcomed, safe, and easy to get around. I filmed a ton of video for a personal vlog (not an influencer lol) and felt comfortable doing so. Was only mildly scammed once in 2 weeks, versus multiple times in my combined 3 days in Tunisia and Morocco.

Some tips for solo travelers: 

* Speak French (I do) or Arabic (shwaya), English is not sufficient.
* Take cash before visiting, and exchange money on the streets. Ask older people on each street for shops that are willing to exchange, and count money carefully. Taxis are also useful.
* Ghardaia (and apparently most of the South) ***needs*** a guide. Hurt my budget, but it was worth seeing. Even taking a picture of a market stall not pointed at people, someone yelled thinking I took a picture of a married woman. If this surprises you, read about the culture in Ghardaia, it is incredibly different to the rest of Algeria.
* If you want to do Annaba-Tunis, fraudeurs (grey market taxis) are safe and seem better than the train. A fun experience too.
* Collective taxis are faster than trains, and use cheap Air Algerie flights for longer distance. Just don't use the train system, only did for Algiers-Oran and it was a nightmare.
* You will probably not meet other solo travelers: this is not Thailand (if you wanted that, you'd probably visit somewhere else). I met one.
* The visa is not as hard as people say. Damn expensive, though.
* For foreigners at least, police were very friendly and not strict  remotely. Your millage may vary: I am incredibly obviously a foreigner and stick out a lot so may have gotten better treatment.

Legitimately one of the friendliest places for foreigners I have ever met. I was given juice by a customs officer, was invited to tea, made friends with fellow passengers. I appreciate that it is a proudly independent country that doesn't worship people just because they're from abroad (definitely been to places where this feels to be the case), but rather this seem to come from more general love of Algeria and curiosity as to why I was visiting. Happy to be a resource for people planning a trip there.

1. Can I arrive very early and enter the palace by purchasing the tickets on the day of? Or since it’s fully booked online, that means there will be no spots for me if I arrive early?

2. If option 1 doesn’t work, has anyone tried Pena Palace in the evening? I could go to the other spots before it.

solotravel,1f0unxv,Seeking Insights for a Solo Trip Across Panama and Guatemala: Budget and Itinerary Advice Needed,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f0unxv/seeking_insights_for_a_solo_trip_across_panama/,5,"Hello everyone!

I'm in my early 20s and planning a solo trip from mid-September to late October, starting in Panama and finishing in Guatemala. My itinerary includes staying mostly at Playa Venao and Bocas del Toro in Panama, then moving on to Guatemala City, with hopes of visiting Antigua, El Paredon, San Pedro La Laguna, Lanquin (including Semuc Champey), Flores, and Tikal in Guatemala.

I've budgeted $2700 for in-country expenses, excluding flights to and from my home country. This budget needs to cover accommodations, daily expenses, and a $300 flight from Panama to Guatemala. I plan to stay mostly in hostels, aiming for a cost of about $25 per night to meet new people and possibly join them on their adventures.

Could anyone who has traveled to these regions recently share their insights on whether this budget sounds realistic? Any tips on managing expenses or must-see places along this route would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",2024-08-25 11:57:44
solotravel,1f0tnvh,Rate my South America itinerary (Jan-April/May),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f0tnvh/rate_my_south_america_itinerary_janaprilmay/,9,"I'll be travelling South America in late Jan-April/May time (was going to go in Sept but I've been offered a 3 month contract I'd like to do before I leave). My original route from Sept was the classic gringo trail down from Ecuador/Peru ending in Chile in December, which obviously works well for the weather. 



Now I'm going in January I'm wondering if it makes more sense to do the Gringo Route in reverse? I would love to see the Caribbean coast of Colombia in dry season/hit carnival there so was going to do that first before flying down to Chile and working my way up.



If I did the classic Gringo Route from Colombia I’d hit Ecuador/Peru in March/early April rainy season and would miss miss the mirror effect on the salt flats doing it this way as I’d end in Bolivia in May, but maybe it’s worth it to travel on a route which everyone else is doing? 



I’m not sure how many people do the route in reverse, but maybe more do that when leaving in Jan/Feb as I assume lots will want to start in Rio for Carnival? Don’t want to miss out on potential travel buddies!



ROUTE PLAN:



27th Dec - 19th Jan: New Zealand (still planning this with my friend but we’re thinking fly into Queenstown for NYE and make our way up to Auckland via car, I can stay a few extra weeks if I want to and explore  more of the North Island)



19th Jan - 6th Feb: Mexico (fly to Houston direct from Auckland then to Oaxaca City)  (18 days) (FYI skipping Yucatan area as I’ve already been there, also been to all of Central America apart from Panama)



* Day 1-5: Oaxaca City
* Day 5-8: San José Del Pacifico 
* Day 8-12: Puerto Escondido
* Day 12-14: Zipolite
* Day 14-18: Mexico City including Butterly migration tour 



6th Feb - March 20th: Panama into Colombia (42 days)



* Day 1: Fly to Panama City from Mexico City
* Day 2-4: Potentially stay around Panama City 
* Day 4-9: San Blas Islands Sail Boat to Cartagena
* Day 9-12: Cartagena 
* Day 12-15: Parque National Tayrona
* Day 15-18: Cabo de La Vela/La Gujira 
* Day 18-21: Minca
* Day 21-26: Barranquilla (carnival)
* Day 26-28: Cartagena, fly to Medellin
* Day 28-32: Medellin 
* Day 32- 36: Salento and Cocora Valley
* Day 36-38: San Gil
* Day 38-42: Bogota, fly to Santiago Chile  



March 20th - April 15th: Chile into Bolivia (26 days)



* Day 1-3: Santiago
* Day 3-11: Bus to Atacama (maybe via stop-off for a night): Atacama Desert, Valley, El Tatio Geysers, Valley of the Moon
* Day 11-15: Salt Flats (hopefully with water on but not too flooded) - arrive 31st March
* Day 15-18: Sucre
* Day 18-20: La Paz
* Day 20-22: Copacabana
* Day 22-25: Lake Titicaca/Isle De La Sol
* Day 26: Travel to Puno, Peru



April 15th - April 30th (15 days): Peru (minus MP as already seen)



* Day 1-3: Puno
* Day 3-7: Arequipa
* Day 7-11: Huacachina and Nazca Lines
* Day 12-13: Paracas 
* Day 14: Travel to Lima
* Day 15: Fly back to London



THEN if I want to keep travelling my plan would be going up into Northern Peru (Huarez) and then hiking Cotopaxi in Ecuador before flying home in May/June.



I’m not rigid with any of these dates, and am happy to stay places longer if I like them, just want to get a vague idea of my route! I also hate flying but from what I’ve read travelling the land border between Colombia/Ecuador isn’t that safe at the moment so I would be flying from Bogota no matter what. ",2024-08-25 10:53:38

I am not rich at all, I've been to few places in Europe here and there, but nothing too long, a week or 10 days tops.

I work a corporate job (marketing) and even though I don't like my job, I can't afford to quit it. I hate that I have to wait a whole year to get few weeks off in summer and go somewhere on vacation. And the agony when I have to get back to work? Ohhhh the agony...........

I think that things would have been different if I was single, but I am in a relationship (5 years now) with a man that I love the most and I literally can't think of going somewhere without him. I want to travel with him, he also has a corporate job but he doesn't want to leave just to ""spend a few months or year somewhere"" (it's not that he doesn't want to travel, he is just a little bit more stable and calm than me). I think that if I hadn't been with him, I would have made more risks and I would have travelled alone somewhere. But as I said, I want to spend my life with him, so breaking up is not an option.

Covid robbed 4 years of my life, so right when I graduated I started working, cause everything was closed and we couldn't leave the country, and now I feel like I've wasted my years in doing nothing.

I don't want to wake up one day when I am old and realize that I've missed out on so many adventures, but I really can't quit my job right now.

It would be ideal for me to find a remote job and then travel but it's very hard finding a remote job that is well paid since I live in a pretty poor country.

I honestly don't know why I posted this, I guess I just need a word of encouragement that I didn't miss out on anything. Thanks!

Edit: wow so many replies! Thank you all for your answers, I've read and appreciated every single one of them. I'll definitely come back to this subreddit with some itinerary soon <3",2024-08-24 16:05:55

I’m a dual national — Dominica (Caribbean island) and USA. I’m a very experienced traveler, I’ve lived outside the U.S. for around 3.5 years, but I mainly always use my American passport just because it’s easier (I know immigrations are more used to seeing Americans). 

However, im going on a 30 day trip around China next week and entering with my Dominica passport (Dominica is one of the few countries in the world that gets 30 days visa free to China). 

After my month in China, I’m going to Vietnam. I’m about to buy my ticket to Vietnam, but realized I wanna enter Vietnam and apply for a visa under my American passport.

This is my question— how do I navigate leaving China since my exit plane ticket I’m going through security with will be my American passport / #, but my entry stamp will be on my Dominica passport and they might want to check that to make sure I didn’t overstay or something? (I can assume). 

I will be leaving out of Shanghai Pudong International if anyone has experience exiting China from there. 

Sorry if this might be a dumb question, I’ve just always stuck to one passport so I wanna make sure I don’t get myself in any doozies with Chinese immigration 😅😵‍💫

solotravel,1f0tjs2,Has anyone stacked bilateral agreements in Schengen?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1f0tjs2/has_anyone_stacked_bilateral_agreements_in/,7,"Hello!

I’ve previously used the bilateral agreements to stay an additional 90 days in Europe but I’ve never attempted to stack them by flying from one bilateral agreement country to the next.

I’ve emailed several embassies and none of them have confirmed in writing they allow this. Most of them have said “you need to enter our country before your Schengen visa expires”. 

Theoretically they should obviously be stackable considering the agreements existed before Schengen but it seems they are enforced differently now since Schengen. 

Thank you!

This is my first solo trip I’ll be visiting Houston for a solo trip from August 29th to September 3rd, and I’m looking for some recommendations to make the most of my trip! Here’s a bit more detail:

Interests:

	•	Nightlife: I’m really into afrobeats, so any clubs or bars that play that genre would be awesome. I am open to other genres of music as well.
      	•	Culture: I’m eager to experience Houston’s diverse culture, especially by visiting cultural sites that reflect the city’s rich heritage. Any recommendations for unique cultural experiences would be great.
	•	Outdoors: I enjoy spending time outdoors, so any parks or scenic spots worth visiting would be great.
	•	People: I’m also looking forward to being around great people, so any social events or gatherings during that time would be a plus.

Itinerary & Budget:

	•	I’ve done some research on popular spots like Turkey Leg Hut and Prospect Park, but I’m open to other suggestions, especially hidden gems. 
	•	I’m staying in the Midtown area and have a moderate budget, so I’m flexible with options as long as they’re worth the experience.

March: Argentina/Chile (fly from Colombia or Brazil) - lake district area (I've already been to Argentinian Patagonia), up from Santiago into Atacama Desert (4 weeks)

April: Bolivia - travel up into Bolivia hoping to catch the salt flats when they've still got water on the them, La Paz, Lake Titicaca (2 weeks)

April/May: Peru/Ecuador - Puno, Arequipa, Huacachina, then possibly Huarez and Ecuador if time (as I've already done Macchu Pichu and Cusco) (4 weeks)

I'm into jungles, ruins, hiking and beaches.

This is what I planned so far

-Antigua: 6 days, highlight pocaya + acatenago hikes, plus some rest days for jet lag and after the hikes

-Lake altilan: 2 nights. I travel often to the como's lake region so I'm used to lakes. What are the highlights of the area? It seems just like a pretty place but most itineraries I've seen allocate a lot of time.

-semuc champey: 2 nights. Just to check out the caves and stuff. I know the trip takes super long so I reckon 2 nights is the minimum. 

-tikal/flores: 2 nights as well. A full day and a half for visiting the site and then two travel days. I plan to fly back to guatemala city.

I can allocate more time to each destination if I'm underestimating the slowness of guatemala's shuttles.

Any recs for places that are partially off the gringo trail but still safe enough for a woman to visit?

One of my favorite places I've visited were arequipa (peru) and jardin (colombia) while im not pretending they are not touristy, i feel like they get so much less tourists that cuzco and guatape while still being safe.

I'd like to allocate the remaining time to travel to el salvador, any recs for beaches were you can swim in it?

Most beaches I've found in the region are only fit for surfing (el paredon) whereas they are unsafe for swimming. 

Any recs from a safety point of view? I traveled  solo to peru and felt mostly safe.

-Way more expensive to leave, about 900-1000€ more for the first week

-Group trip starts in sydney so i would have to travel away after the first week since its very expensive there

Im not the most social person and thats part of why im doing this trip, is to get out of my comfort zone and be more confident.

Here's what I've come up with so far for destinations and possible activities in each place:

* **Day 1-4**: Bangkok (*sightseeing, Khao San, Muay Thai, Ayutthata*)
* **Day 5-8**: Chiang Mai (*sightseeing, visit to elephant sanctuary, nature hikes, wakeboarding*)

* **Day 27-29**: Ho Chi Minh (*sightseeing, war museum, Cu Chi tunels, Mekong Delta*)
* **Day 30-32**: Phnom Penh (*sightseeing, killing fields, genocide museum*)
* **Day 33-35**: Siem Reap (*Angkor Wat, night market, Tonle Sap lake*)
* **Day 36-37**: Bangkok (*relax before flight home*)

I'd be keen to hear any general thoughts anyone had about that, and in particular whether there's any must-visit places or must-do activities that I'm currently missing out. I also had a couple of specific questions I'd appreciate any thoughts on as well:

* If you have no motorbike experience, is it only possible to do the Ha Giang Loop with an easy rider tour? And does that mean that you're on the back of a bike being driven by somebody else?

* Is there anywhere roughly halfway between Luang Prabang and Hanoi that would be worth visiting? I'd originally hoped to do all my travel by bus or train, but when I saw that particular leg would be 24 hours I resigned myself to flying instead. However, if there's another stop I can add which would break up that trip, I'd consider tweaking the itinerary a bit to do it.

How does it compare to the desert in Dubai?,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ezfl9t/has_anyone_gone_to_huacachina_in_peru_how_does_it/,32,"I planned a Peru trip, and the majority is planned around Cusco and Sacred Valley however I have a spare day in Lima before flying back home and was planning to spend it doing a day trip to Huacachina. However my departing flight just changed and I have a bit less time in Lima, making a day trip to Huacachina not possible. I’m thinking of just resting in Lima and doing paragliding since that looks really fun there.

I feel like I will be missing out heavily if I don’t go to Huacachina though. Lots of lists displaying best attractions in Peru always note it. I can extend my trip by an extra day, but the flight costs are way more, like $400 more. Would I regret not paying extra to make time for huacachina? For context aswell, earlier this year I was in Dubai and did a desert tour going out in the desert and doing sandboarding there, so wondering how those deserts might compare. 

If you were in my shoes, would you pay an extra $400 to go to Huacachina for a day despite already having been to a desert in Dubai and sandboarding there? Or are they sort of the same experience and should go for paragliding or just exploring more of Lima?",2024-08-23 15:26:19
solotravel,1ezb6vy,Rate my two itineraries (South America),5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ezb6vy/rate_my_two_itineraries_south_america/,3,"Hi all, 

I'm doing solo travel from Dec-April/May and am starting in Aus/NZ to visit a friend for Xmas and New Year. I travelled SE Asia earlier this year so that's off the cards, and I'm desperate to go to South America for a few months. I was originally going to go Sept-Dec but have been offered a three month contract which I'm keen to take before I go. 

Places I most want to visit are: Colombia (Caribbean side) especially for carnival, Bolivia (salt flats ideally in water, Lake Titicaca)

Direct flights from Auckland to the Americas are either to Santiago in Chile or LA. I can catch a connecting flight from one of those places. 

I'm keen to go hiking and explore nature, and really don't want tons of cloud and rain if I can help it. I'm happy to do some slight country-hopping to catch the best weather but am also not a good flyer and would like to do a traditional route to maybe meet people on the way. 

I've been to Argentina (BA, Patagonia) and Peru (Machu Pichu, Cusco, Amazon), and also most of Central America (although I only did the Yucatan side of Mexico and am keen to see other areas). 

I've got two potential options - any recommendations are welcome! 

  
Option 1: 

Pros of hitting good weather, seeing Salt Flats with mirror, Cons of lots of jumping around countries and potentially missing making travel friends who are doing a more traditional route down:

Jan - New Zealand - 2-4 weeks (2 with friend, other time solo)

Jan-Feb - Mexico via LA/SF: Mexico City, Oaxaca, Butterfly Migration, Beaches - 2-4 weeks OR Chilean Lake District area via direct flight from NZ for 2 weeks)

Mid Feb-mid March - Colombia (fly from Mexico/Chile): Cartagena, Tayrona, Minca, Salento, Lost City Hike, Carnival, plus small amount of time in cities -  4-6 weeks

mid/end of March: Northern Chile into Bolivia (fly to Santiago from Bogota): 3 weeks, aim to hit the Salt Flats in Bolivia when there is water on them end of March/beginning of April

April: Bolivia into Peru (Lake Titicaca, Arequipa, Lima), fly back from Lima to UK

Optional extra time into May: Northern Peru (Huarez) into Ecuador (Cotopaxi hike)



Option 2: Pros of being the traditional gringo route down from Colombia so chance of meeting people, cons of doing it at potentially the wrong time of year and hitting Ecuador/Northern Peru in rainy season and missing mirror on Salt Flats  
  
Jan - New Zealand - 4 weeks (2 with friend, 2 solo) 

end of Jan- mid Feb - Mexico via LA/SF: Mexico City, Oaxaca, Butterfly Migration, Beaches - 2-4 weeks

mid Feb- mid/end of March - Colombia (fly from Mexico): Cartagena, Tayrona, Minca, Salento, Lost City Hike, Carnival, plus small amount of time in cities -  4-6 weeks

mid/end March - beginning/mid April - Ecuador (if safe enough) - Cotopaxi area, Quito, Banos - 2-4 weeks 

April - Northern Peru to Lake Titicaca (Huarez, Arequipa, Puno) - 3 weeks

May - Bolivia (Lake Titicaca, Salt Flats, La Paz) - flight back to UK 

  
Does anyone have any suggestions/experiences with any of these routes? I'm also open to other suggestions if this seems like it just won't work out. ",2024-08-23 12:14:53
solotravel,1eysmpx,Feeling good! Trip report thus far,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eysmpx/feeling_good_trip_report_thus_far/,12,"I (59M) planned an impromptu trip less than two months ago.  Was prompted to do so by my ex-girlfriend of 10 years.  Seems I was a clingy type and one of those that dedicated myself too much to one person and to my work. So I quit my job of 15 years and booked a trip to Europe.  I have never traveled alone.  Before this girl I was married and raised 4 children. That was pretty much my sole existence.  

Anyhow I booked a flight to Geneva with return flight of early October.  So that gives me 2 months.  

Booked hostels and AirBNB places for the first two weeks and figured I would wing it from there and travel by bus and train. 

Days 1-3 I ended up being stuck in NYC.  Weather problems, landing gear broke on one flight. Lightning hit another one of my planes. Thanks Delta.  So I had to rearrange my days and accommodations right off the bat.  Was close to calling the whole thing off 

Day 4: flew into Geneva but arrived late at night.  Found a hostel and stayed.  Not a great place but really not interested in sightseeing because I had to change plans and get back on track with what I had originally planned. 

Days 5-7:  took a train to Lustenau, Austria.  Lovely town and a fantastic host who made me get my head on straight and not have any doubts about the upcoming days. Her family took me in and gave super advice, use of her bike and a personal tour of the mountains.  They even insisted on buying me dinner. Although not a real common place for tourists the town offers a lot.  Beautiful mountains, hiking, a good small town feel and such. 

Days 8-10 took the train across Austria to Graz. More of a cultural view of Austria than my previous place.  The architecture from the Hapsburg era was phenomenal yet there are pockets of modernity that flow well.  

Days 11-13 Ljubljana, Slovenia.  I LOVE this place.  I LOVE the hostel I stayed at.  Actually was a capsule hotel.  Like a pod.  Slept like a rock.  Smoked a joint. lol.   The transit system works really well but I found myself using their bike rental service that the city operates.  It is essentially 1 euro for  the entire month rental and is a very bike friendly place.  The park and zoo were a welcome addition to looking at parks and architecture.  

So far, aside from the initial flight,  I’m spending on average about $50 per day.  Usually I find myself eating at some cafe or bar once per day and the rest making sandwiches or nibbling on fruits, cheese and meats from the grocery store. 

I decided I need to spend more time at each destination to explore more or to have downtime to just chill or watch a movie on Netflix.  

I’ve never done any type of review before.  I need to consult my notes better for Reddit. 

My tips this far:  
I was very apprehensive initially.  I have never done something like this by myself.  Especially after sleeping in the airport for 3 nights.  Power thru it!   Things will be ok. 

I have missed local busses.  Got lost or misdirected while walking streets. Make lots of notes and pin drops on maps to find your way and have a backup phone and battery pack.  Have a sit on a bench.  Collect yourself.  Get back to it.  I’m sure one day I may be a veteran of this. 

Take time to enjoy what you are doing.  I dont think you should rush thru things for the sake of seeing everything.  


Days 14-16 Zagreb Croatia - will update. 
Days 17-20 Budapest - currently here.  

Later!   I’m going to go sit on the steps and watch traffic go by.

solotravel,1eyjjhc,Solo travel in the Balkans ,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eyjjhc/solo_travel_in_the_balkans/,12,"I solo-travelled on bicycle for 4 months in the Balkans.

A month ago now, i put packed my bike in a carton box to take the bus and go back in a fixed place I call home. 
I've been cycling from beginning April to end of july 2024, around Croatia, Bosnia, Monténégro, Albania, Macedonia, Greece and Bulgaria, with my stuff and my guitar. 

\Accommodation:\
I have all equipment for wildcamping on my bike. 
I have been sometimes to camping, very occasionally to hostels, sometimes hosted by locals.
Wildcamp is forbidden in some Balkan countries mostly as a mean to limit tourism damage in the very touristic areas. Tho I never had any problem wildcamping . Be careful of not being seen, not camp near cities and be very respectful of the places you stay. Bosnia and Montenegro are of the best and easiest countries to wildcamp.
I was using warshower as a hosting platform sometimes. Its like a couchsurfing but for cyclists. Thanks to it, I got away with couple of free nights in big cities (Sarajevo, Thessaloniki...).

\Budget :\
I have my guitare with me and I'm playing and singing in the streets. It helps to gain money on the way to reduce the expenses.
After 4 months I'm left with an approximate global balance of -720€, (in which I roughly had +360€ of income with street playing). 
\*Approximate list of counts:\*
\460€ of food\
\60€ of gears\
\190€ of accommodation\
\160€ of extra fun\
\50€ of sim cards and bank fee\
\160€ of transport\
So lets round up to 1100€ in total.

\Food:\
I usually cooked with my stove, so very little expenses in restaurants, much more in backery (for burek!) Balkan basic food (veggies, pasta, rice...) Is very cheap. The only ""fancy"" regular expenses I had were nuts and sometimes these granola bars, that help me snack during cycling.
Pro tip : always carry a tupperware! You never know what locals can offer you for the road, and you can store your leftover food.

\Fun:\
I usually choose to hike, swim, go to outdoor concert or other free things. 
Most fun expenses are local buses, tickets to national parks or ferry to go cycling on islands.

\Timetable:\
I was planning the day for the day after for where i would stop to sleep, with always some flexibility of changing my mind. As for the road planning, i was following a route i would have plan around 1 week beforehand. I kinda knew my final destination from the start but not the road to go there.
I got used with time, to let go of too much planification...

\Social:\
I'm at ease being by myself in general. I like very much meeting people on the way, but I'm ok being alone. I'm not seeking for alone time, I'm just taking what's coming. I sometimes rode with cyclists i met on the way for couple of days.
I'm off insta/fb or other social media (does Reddit count?). I dont share my trip publicly, my family WhatsApp group is my social media.
I have met a huge amount of people on the way, got nice fast connections with some, much deeper connections with others.
I appreciated very much the spontaneity of some locals to propose their help, their roof, and their support. Balkans have a lot this genuine help without expectations when you go out of the touristics areas.

\Travelling as a solo girl/safety\
This part is for the ones who ask weekly if the balkans are a safe place to travel. There is no general yes or no answer. Crowded area tend to tire me, so I'm more vulnerable and less alert of my surroundings. Remote areas makes me more dependent to locals, to ask my way or find food, shelter or water, and they don't speak a lot of English. What i can advise is ""trust your guts"". Be aware of your stuff and your surroundings at all time, always check that you have batterie and signal, if you go to hike always try to remember the road, study a bit the map in advance, check when shops close, check the days off of every country you cross.
Be as autonomous as possible, in control of the situation, so if you need to fly, you can. Talk loud, assert your boundaries and never hesitate to say no. Applying this, i never had any problems. I could smell sketchy situations from afar and therefore avoid them easely. I was neither paranoid, but i cand feel when i can trust someone or not.
This applies to every destination, not only balkans. And when you can trust the people from there in a safe way, the payback is definitely worth it. Its a super rich culture, impregnated with a awesomely strong will, an infiite kindness and hospitality if you show gratitude. 

\Some random tips :\
Ex Yugoslavian countries tend to speak more German than English. Always try to know some basic words in the local language, locals will be thrilled.
Check in advance or with locals if the water is drinkable, its not always obvious. Same for the question of throwing paper in the toilet or in a bin.
Summer in balkans in very hot. Can become almost bothering to be outside. Avoid month of August i would say, more heat, more tourists, and most expensive prices. 

Ps : this travel is part of a bigger travel, I've been out of my home country for almost a year now, but I've been ""Wwoofing"" around in the same placed for a long time so I didn't count it on this post. Its only the bicycle part :)",2024-08-22 13:37:31

Hello Everyone!!

My apologies in advance for the long post, but I am hoping to hear some advice, wisdom, and insight. 

I am a 23F from Canada and I will be landing in CDMX this January. I have been researching neighbourhoods, tours, activities, etc. I am planning on staying in Mexico City for a week, at least. I hope to also visit Puebla/Cholula, Cuernavaca, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. Would one month be sufficient or should I plan to be in Mexico longer? What were your experiences with bussing and public transit like? Anything I must do/see? Anything I should leave out?

After visiting Chiapas, I would like to fly to my next destination. I hope to make my way down South starting in Belize or Guatemala travelling by bus from this point on (preferably). I would love to finish in Panama. Any tips for travelling from country to country? This is overwhelming!

If I plan for this itinerary, I was thinking a total of 3-4 months travelling. Has anyone done a similar route? What would you recommend as far as time frames go? Would you skip Belize? And would you skip El Salvador or Honduras? Visit all? None of the above? I am interested in a well rounded trip of relaxation, architecture, beaches, partying, adventures (including adrenaline), and food (of course!!). 

I have budgeted for 2000 CAD per month (no flights included) but I do have extra wiggle room. I do not speak Spanish, but I have been trying to learn for the past few months, I know enough of the basics to get my point across. 

I only have a one-way flight booked so that I have the freedom to fly home sooner or later if I so choose. 

Any and all insight is much appreciated. If you have travelled to any Central American countries, I would love to hear about your experience, must-sees/dos, and highlights/lowlights.",2024-08-23 01:06:20

I was looking at google maps trying to find the subway. He started the conversation by directing me to the subway but quickly began telling me that he was from Belfast and was raising money for some charity there. I said that I would not be giving money to him. This was just so fake. First he said he moved to New York from Belfast in 2011 I didn’t believe this for a second because he was black with a southern accent I reckon he was from Louisiana or Georgia or somewhere in that area and he was lying about when he came to New York. I’m white and from Dublin I know what a Northern Ireland accent sounds like and he didn’t have it also 15 years ago Northern Ireland had an all white population. He talked about getting euro which is yet another red flag. Northern Ireland is part of the uk where they use pound not euro. Thirdly he was very persistent in getting me to pay. So if you are going to the tourist area in New York be on alert for scammers. ,2024-08-22 04:49:25

So what prompts would you recommend? I can recycle them, but I need more variety than I’m capable of alone apparently. Here’s what I have so far:

How does the air feel?
What do people around you sound like?

I feel devastated and pathetic. Planned to see this beautiful baroque town, hike in the alps, a short trip to Germany and even brought a nice dress to see a concert. I have two more days here, than I will have to board a train where people will freak out, when I start coughing. Plan to wear a mask but understand if people don’t feel comfortable around me. 

I don’t plan to see a doctor, but I am happy that I have a travel insurance. I already talked to the insurance company, they sent me addresses of local doctors they already worked with and gave me all the information I need to know if things get worse. This makes me feel secure.

Even though I scheduled in some rest days I'm starting to feel a bit exhausted. 
It's my first solo trip outside of home (Australia). I also have coeliac disease so that causes a bit of stress around eating out, especially as Australia and New Zealand have higher gluten free restrictions than the rest of the world.

I now have 4 full days in Stavanger before I move on (I'm travelling via public transport) so I'm planning on some real rest days but I'm feeling like I've been on a real emotional rollercoaster ride so far.

I (27F) am planning on doing some solo travelling across SEA from January. I’m flying into Bangkok as that is the easiest place for me to get to and seems to be the best advised place to start my travels.

I’m planning to enter Cambodia and head over to Siem Reap pretty soon after I arrive and am looking for advice about crossing the border. I’ve seen mixed experiences about crossing the border via train/bus, that it’s a pretty lengthy journey either side, that scammers at the border are quite intense, that the ‘free’ shuttle bus from Poi Pet is a scam itself etc., so any tips anyone can offer would be appreciated.

Is it worth booking onto a bus company like Giant Ibis instead of taking the train? If I were to take the train to Aranyaprathet and head into Poi Pet, how would I go about getting a shared taxi/bus to Siem Reap? Any advice on getting through the visa process?

I know some people advise getting a flight but I’d rather not do that if possible, I would like to see some of the views while travelling too.",2024-08-22 21:12:12

I only have two weeks and would like to do a combination of city (sightseeing and shopping) and relaxing on a beach. 

Initially I wanted to spend roughly one week in Bangkok and then go to Koh Chang for the second week. However, I read that during September Koh Chang can be heavily impacted by the rain (restaurant & hotels closing, roads flooding, ferries not going regularly etc.)

Alternative itinerary:
- Bangkok (1 week)
- Koh Samui (1 week)
- Flying to Koh Samui and back would definitely make the trip more expensive and I am worried that it will be very touristy 

Alternative itinerary 2:
- Bangkok (1 week)
- Beach in Hua Hin (~ 3 days)
- Singapore (~ 3 days)
- I would then fly back home from Singapore. I did a semester abroad in Singapore in 2016, so I would love to go back. But I am not sure if it will be too stressful since I also want to go to the beach in Hua Hin first. Also it would obviously make the trip more expensive.

What are you thoughts? Are there some other good beach options for september?

I am a women in my late 20s. For the “beach part” of my trip I would like to go somewhere that will have some younger people (but doesn’t have to be lots), relaxed vibes with some nice restaurants and bars. I am not looking for a crazy party scene. 

I am also open for any other county in (south east) Asia.

My job is currently the only thing holding me back from taking the plunge with solo travel. I HATE my job. It bores me to death and kills my mental energy. But it’s salaried at $80k, WFH 2 days a week, and it’s easy work. Sometimes I feel ungrateful because I know there are people making do with less, and I’m afraid to leave it behind because I don’t know what I’m going to do when I get back. Is 6 months of travel worth this job? For anyone that quit their job before traveling, did it all work itself out when you came back?

**Is it worth solo traveling if I don’t care about nature and history?**

I may get some flack for this, but I really have no interest in nature, hiking, museums, or historical monuments. I’m mainly traveling to experience new cultures, try new foods, meet people from other countries/other solo travelers. Is this a juvenile or unrealistic way to look at travel? Do you find that there isn’t much else to do in certain countries? I’m considering if solo travel is even for me, or if I’m just bored of my current routine.

**Does/did solo travel change you as a person?**

Many solo travelers describe their trip as the best time of their lives; now of course that doesn’t apply to everyone, but has traveled changed you in any way? Made you more confident, more present, more appreciative of what you have, anything? I feel like solo travel is a scratch I need to itch before I can move on with the rest of my life, partly because I feel like I need to grow as a person.

I recently booked my dream holiday to Japan for 3 weeks in Kansai. I have never traveled abroad and have wanted to visit Japan for such a long time.

I saved up for a year, and was constantly thinking about this trip.

Finally I had enough money, and I feel like as soon as I did, the trip became cursed.

-Getting time off work was a NIGHTMARE

-My bank blocked my card and made booking flights and hotel a nightmare.

-My work booked me on a 4 DAY course from THE DAY BEFORE I FLY OUT (this caused me to have to book an airport hotel etc and I'm stuck at the airport budget hotel for 4 days prior to my flight by myself, this also wastes suitcase space)

The above also delayed my leave being approved which meant flight price increased and it wasted a day of my trip as I have to stay overnight at the airport for another day and fly out the following day

Eventually I got so annoyed and flustered and I just booked flights and a single hotel for the entire 3 weeks in Osaka, when I was intending to move around. I just wanted the booking over with rather than being excited to pick hotels etc.

Additionally I work in a form of retail and our store has started to be very quiet so head office are putting downwards pressure on us, and as well as this I cracked a wisdom tooth and the dentist can't fix it until after my trip, so I have pain on that side of my face and just have to take painkillers.

Sorry for the rant, I was so excited to go to Japan, but all of the above has just ramped my stress and anxiety through the roof and now I'm wishing I hadn't even booked the trip and have even considered cancelling.

I know it would be foolish to do this and once I get there and check in to my hotel I will be so proud of myself for making it. It might sound pathetic but saving for this holiday and overcoming my fear of being outside my comfort zone would probably be my biggest achievement in life so far.

Anyone have any words of reassurance or can relate?",2024-08-22 11:42:01

Definitely going to Amsterdam first and foremost, but I’ve also heard great things about The Hague, day trips in Utrecht and Leiden, and am also interested in visiting Rotterdam. However, my knowledge of the Netherlands is limited to only Amsterdam and am looking for inspiration from anyone who’s been to any of the other cities to supplement the rest of my research :)

Right now I know for sure I want to do these things:

* visit Anne Frank House
* visit Van Gogh museum
* do a canal cruise
* visit Rijiksmuseum
* try cultural foods

As far as other activities, I love learning about the cultural of the place I’m visiting, history-based tours, seeing cool architecture, trying great food, and moderately active excursions. Basically I love being a tourist so I’m open to anything 😂

Right now, here’s a tentative itinerary:

Arrival in AMS on Oct 11th around 1pm

* leaves me with a half day to do 1-2 activities and have a nice lunch/dinner
* (probably leaning on a chill museum tour this day)

Oct 12th (my birthday)

* full day in Amsterdam
* canal cruise
* Anne Frank House (this is a Saturday tho and I know the tickets sell out fast so I lowkey have no hope for this LMAO)
* nice birthday dinner (restaurant recs? I’m open to anything except shellfish since I’m allergic)

Oct 13th

* maybe a day trip to Utrecht or Leiden?
* may transfer to a hotel in The Hague
* explore The Hague if I transfer
* (need help planning the rest)

Oct 14th

* maybe transfer to a hotel in Rotterdam
* a day trip to either Utrecht or Leiden (whichever one I don’t visit the previous day)
* also explore things in Rotterdam if I transfer
* (need help planning the rest)

Oct 15th (my last full day)

* free day, open to anything :) also willing to switch things around from the previous days!

Oct 16th

* plane leaves at like 1pm so I’ll be at the airport by 10am 🥲

Im staying at Hilton properties, so that’s covered. Mainly just looking for advice on activities and the like. Thank you in advance to everyone who contributes :)

Back in December I started seeing this girl and things quickly got serious, she herself had been solo travelling all over Europe and SE Asia in the past. When we first got together I think I was having a bit of an identity crisis, and hearing about her travels really motivated me to take some time off from work and backpack around as I’ve never solo travelled before. I soon booked 2months off of work with plans to go around Southern Europe. We’ve been talking about this trip of mine this whole time and we were both really excited for me to maybe grow a bit as a person and experience things I’ve never thought about before.

To cut a long story short, she went on a short trip overseas recently for about a week to see her friends, ended up catching up with her ex-bf, sleeping with him, and is now going to move to that country to pursue a relationship with him again.

I’m obviously really cut up about the end of the relationship we had, but with that aside I’m really struggling to find the motivation to go on this trip. It’s in just over 2 weeks!! I have all my flights and some of my hotels/hostels booked and paid for, but a big part of me now thinks there’s no reason to go on this trip anymore. She was such a big influence for me to go, and I was looking forward to coming back home to her and telling her all my stories and sharing photos with her etc. but that’s no longer gonna happen. I feel such a mixed bag of anger and sadness I can’t think straight.

Has anyone had a similar experience and want to offer up some advice or motivating words? I feel like I’m just going to be thinking about her the whole time and it’s going to impact the trip so negatively it’s not gonna be worth it.",2024-08-21 09:09:45

Cross posting because I didn't get any feedback in travel. 

I am considering a trip to Slovenia in early October for roughly 7 days. One of the primary reasons I am interested in going is that I'm an equestrian and planning to take some riding lessons at Lipica farm. From what I've read, Im hopeful to take 1-2 lessons a day for 3 days while there. I am hoping for some feedback on the itinerary for the rest of my trip. Im not sure if it's going to be too compacted and the other thing is that Im not sure if I have enough to fill my time in the afternoons or mid portion of the day when Im not riding- I don't know what is reasonably close to Lipica.

Day 1: arrive around MN in Ljubljana, sleep

Day 2: Explore Ljubljana, drive toward Bled Lake in the evening

Day 3: 1/2 day hiking in Vintgar Gorge, 1/2 day exploring Bled Castle/Lake

Day 4: Hike in Triglav, head South toward Lipica (considered stop at Soca River)

Day 5: Riding lesson + Predjama Castle/Postjana Cave

Day 6: Riding lesson + tour of Lipica Farm

Day 7: Riding lesson + 1300 flight to home

I have also considered the idea of adding in a day trip or afternoon trip to Trieste since that seems close to Lipica area. Is this plan reasonable?

I will be travelling in South Africa for two months (december and january) and thought it would be nice to include some time in Lesotho.

I'm planning to cross the Sani Pass border from South Africa in the east of the country, and then go back to SA through the border in Maseru, to the west.

I'm finding very few information online, only the odd report in a few old blogs. Can you share your experience?

I won't be driving, and from what I was able to research I have either the option to use shared taxi from the city of Underberg/SA to Mokhotlong/Lesotho, or join a tour to the Sani Pass and then find my way around Lesotho.

The tour option seems convenient since I'm already planning to spend a few days hiking in the Drakensberg and would be staying in this hostel called Sani Lodge Backpackers, which offers this tour to the border. However, it would definetelly be much more expensive, and I still don't know how to go from the border to the town of Mokhotlong.

A shared taxi seems fun to sort out and would be cheaper, but it looks like I would need to figure things out after arriving, and I would like to have some other options. The biggest advantage would be going directly all the way up to Mokhotlong.

I would if you could share any experience regarding the border crossing, or tips about Lesotho in general.

Any suggestions for specific cities? I plan on slow traveling and going to 5-6 locations per country for the longer stays.

Budget is 18k canadian, so approx 95$ CAD a day and this is excluding flights (let me know if I should save more!). I’m a partier (sometimes sadly) so alcohol will take a chunk away but my aim is to mainly see sites and doing new activities (surf classes etc.)

I’ve never been to South Dakota so I would appreciate any tips to solo traveling that I should know and anything I should know in general about the Badlands. 

I’ll be driving into South Dakota (abt 7 hours) and plan on staying in town for general comfort and safety. I would love to backcountry camp but I’m just not comfortable doing that on my first full solo trip ever. Will do some sunset + morning hikes, drive the Badlands Loop, sunset hike, stargaze at the Amphitheater, and I’m considering a helicopter tour. Spending a long weekend there in the fall. 

I live within a reasonable distance from the Badlands so I’m not too worried about missing out on anything, I can always come back, but I would appreciate any insight on how to make the trip as smooth as possible for a first timer. ",2024-08-20 19:17:21
solotravel,1ewkxdt,Advice to socialise in hostels,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ewkxdt/advice_to_socialise_in_hostels/,80,"I am mid 30’s male, and I find it quite hard to socialise in hostels whenever I go for solo travel. I find a few major barriers : 

a) the local age group in the hostels is much less ( ~20 to 25 years ), 👴🏾

b) I am of Indian origin and trying to socialise in the western world (it’s perhaps a controversial aspect , but felt some uneasiness due to this), 🤷🏻

c) I am introverted and have very few topics to share thoughts in.. I am more of a listener. 🤐

d) there are dietary restrictions (makes it awkward internally to join for dinner/pub crawl) 😩

Are there any suggestions on how to move forward and socialise?

I'll be starting my year+ long adventure in October . I've got about 6-8 months pencilled in to see all of SEA, but after that I don't really know where I'll end up (there's a few countries on my shortlist..)

I'll be arriving and starting in Bangkok. What I'd really love to know is, for those of you who started you have done the same, what happened in next, the immediate few days / weeks after?

I have a vague route planned - the usual, apparently, up north to Chang Mai then onto Pai etc etc - though would love to stop off on the way up at Ayutthaya or Kanchanaburi to see everything there is to see. I want to take it slowly, and settle down in places that I like.

How much of that comes to fruition will depend, of course, on the people I meet in my first hostel or two. I am someone who can make friends very quickly, I'm also someone who is very easily persuaded.

So - what are your guys experiences? I hear all the time ""get ready to dump all your plans and routes"". I am ready to do this. I am ready for my dreams of walking along through a jungle and discovering an ancient temple unseen for thousands of years to be squashed because my new friends want to go to Pai and get pissed for 2 weeks.

But what does this mean in practice?

Just how far off route can you expect to go?",2024-08-20 16:58:57

I returned home this weekend, and it's taken a few days to process how phenomenal this trip was. What an absolutely gorgeous country. I am in awe. The people were wonderful, so kind. I met and became instant friends with a few people on the tour I took. 

Traveling solo was such a liberating experience. The trust I've restored within myself feels life changing. Relying only on myself was such an important part of releasing the lingering grief I was holding onto.

I'm 29 y/o M from UK, soon to be travelling solo. I'm looking to quit my job in the next month & will have between 2-3 months travelling solo, as I need to get back mid-Dec.

As I'm on my own I don't want too many big cities, my fave city in the world Mexico City for example, although I feel on my own I'd much rather beaches (learn to surf), local towns, history/ruins and a rainforest or so to explore. The odd party I will be joining in with, although not the reason for the trip. I would like a big city (hence the inclusion of Colombia), although not to be the bulk of the trip - on my own I'd rather take a more 'chilled' route then hustle and bustle of big city.

I have chosen the following places as a skeleton, although would appreciate if anyone could help me whittle down/give suggestions/tell me anywhere I'm really missing (for example El Salvador or Honduras). I don't want to move around every 3 days so just want to try work out the right route:

Belize

Guatemala

Nicaragua

Panama (do the Las Blas Islands to Colombia - can remove this if under too much time pressure)

Colombia

Peru

* **Sri Lanka**: Colombo, Kandy, Ella, Habarana and surrounding area, surfing in southern coast (exact beach town is TBD) 

#Winter

solotravel,1ewsiah,Healing journey - travel recs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ewsiah/healing_journey_travel_recs/,18,"Hi everyone,

I’m taking a 4-month leave from a job I’ve been at for almost five years, and I’m hoping to use this time to focus on my well-being and figure out my next steps in life. After experiencing a lot of personal challenges, including loss, multiple moves, and ongoing anxiety and depression, I’m eager to find a place where I can heal, try new things, and gain some clarity.

I’ll be starting my trip in Italy in mid-September for a wedding, and after that, I’m considering spending about two weeks in Sicily (or less). I’ve heard great things about Ubud in Bali (though touristy?) and Kenya as potential destinations, and I’m also planning to head to Costa Rica in late December or early January. However, I’m not sure where to go between Italy and Costa Rica.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* A peaceful environment: I need a place where I can find tranquility and time to reflect.
* Healing: Ideally, somewhere that supports relaxation and personal growth.
* Community and connection: I’m hoping to meet like-minded people and find a sense of community.
* Good public transport or scooter access: I don’t drive, so getting around easily is important.
* Health and wellness: Access to healthy food and activities like yoga, hiking, biking, or surfing, etc

If you have any recommendations for destinations or specific neighborhoods that fit these criteria, I’d really appreciate your input. I’m open to various locations, as long as they align with my goals for this journey. 

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!",2024-08-20 10:54:14

solotravel,1ewa4tt,Itinerary help for Ireland in September,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ewa4tt/itinerary_help_for_ireland_in_september/,11,"Hi everyone, I am planning a trip to Ireland next month, from the third week of September till the first week of October. So, I'll tentatively be staying for two weeks. I'll be flying from India to Dublin, so my trip will probably start from Dublin. I'm travelling solo. I'm trying to form an itinerary, but I'm having difficulties planning one because of the short duration of my stay. 

I'd ideally want to cover as much as possible without rushing into things, so that I can get a feel of the country and experience the Irish towns, countryside, landscapes, and culture. I probably won't be renting a car because I don't have a valid driver's licence, so unless I find a group of travellers renting one to tag along, car travel is ruled out. What would you suggest as an alternative?

My budget would be moderate, nothing fancy or lavish, but not touring broke either. I have looked into potential towns, things to do places to see, etc online, but I'm unable to get some clarity and ideas. 

Should I just book flight tickets and accomodation for Dublin, and just wing it from there? Or can you guys give any suggestions as to how I can plan out the rest of my itinerary after staying in Dublin. I was thinking 3 days in Dublin should be enough right? Instead of booking return tickets from Dublin, I was thinking of booking tickets to the nearest airport from the last place I'm staying, depending on how affordable the tickets are. 

Speaking of accomodation, since I'm travelling solo, I was thinking of staying in backpacker hostels wherever possible, since I can meet new people and form groups and hang out whenever I'm travelling and sightseeing. However, I wouldn't mind couchsurfing or staying in Airbnbs and other B&Bs either, if I can get to socialize with people(perhaps the hosts?). I've heard sometimes hosts can also show you around areas and places like a local. Let me know what you would recommend. 

Considering the unpredictable weather of Ireland, what would you suggest I pack and wear during my trip?

My areas of interests are seeing the Irish towns and villages, exploring the countryside, greenery,autumn foliage,scenic landscapes,walking tours, castles and museums, visiting cities, pub crawls and hops, cafe and dining culture(nothing too expensive of course), live music shows, attending events and festivals(I heard there is the Lisdoonvarna matchmaking festival, how is that?) etc. A mixture of touristy and non touristy, off beat ideas. 

I apologise for the long and lengthy post, I just wanted to explain the gist of my situation and ask questions regarding my trip. So, any suggestions folks?

I also might bring my work laptop just in case of any urgent work, emails, logging in, etc. are there any laws against remote work? I have an American passport, and my company is American,  though my base location is in India. My organisation doesn't have any issues as long as I connect through VPN, and follow data privacy laws, and keep my laptop and data safe. Generally, how safe is Ireland if I'm carrying my laptop everywhere, and also in general when I'm walking at night, especially after visiting a pub or any event for that matter? Especially, for a brown man in his mid to late 20s.",2024-08-19 19:05:17
solotravel,1evx35o,"Trip Report: Vietnam/Thailand - One Month
",40,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1evx35o/trip_report_vietnamthailand_one_month/,17,"Been a big fan of reading these and thought this would be a fun way to remember the trip. Hopefully this is helpful for your planning as I noticed a shortage of trip reports on here! I was there from the end of March to the end of April this year.

I’ll just note that I was planning on doing a full month in Vietnam, but found out last minute that some friends were going to be in Thailand at the same time so I made a detour to see them. I’m happy with how things turned out, but otherwise I would recommend sticking to just one country in that time. Vietnam has so much there and there’s so much I didn’t get to!

**Visa**: I believe they’re adding longer visas, but I got the 30-day multi-entry one for $50. You apply online at the government website. Here's [some instructions](https://vn.usembassy.gov/vietnamese-visas-and-entry-exit/) from the US. Make sure to apply in advance to be safe, but I cut it kind of close and it came in three work days I think? **You need the visa printed out to board your flight.**

# Ho Chi Minh City - 6 days (Arrived Monday night, left Sunday)

I know some people will say this is a long time, but honestly it’s a huge city and if you can’t find a week’s worth of stuff to do that really reflects more on you than anything.  That being said, I stayed a couple nights more than I planned on because I met some people and wanted to go out on the weekend. When I left I was ready to get out of the city.

**Accommodation:**

First three nights — Long Hostel

Booked because people on here recommended it as being a bit quieter location. They only had a private room available so I booked it because I wanted to get a good rest after arriving late. Overall, it was v chill and good location. Appreciated the homemade breakfast and the staff. But it was kind of difficult to meet people to do things with because it was so chill and there wasn’t much opportunity for socializing. Would recommend if you’re looking to rest up, but not for meeting people to travel with.

Rest of Time - Saigon Rooftops

Switched here because I hoped it would be more social. Really cool complex with walkways between the rooms and like four layers of roof decks with a bar. You get a free beer at the bar each day and it was decently easy to meet people at the happy hour. It’s a big hostel but it doesn’t feel overwhelming. Not a ton of activities at the hostel but you can book tours through them. (Like all the hostels I stayed at.) They also sell sim cards at the front desk. It’s a little further from the main walking street area than some other hostels. Maybe a 10 minute walk. Overall, would recommend. (I did hear the hideout is fun, as well.)

**Attractions:**

Bến Thành Market- Tons of knock offs and other inexpensive items, although it does get repetitive. There’s also a section with food stalls. Spent maybe an hour walking around and overpaying for things since I didn’t know to haggle. (One guide later said to start with a 70% discount. Just start to walk away if you don’t like the initial price.)

Independence Palace - I like seeing cursed fancy buildings so I enjoyed this. Nice ‘60s architecture that incorporates Vietnamese tradition. Also there’s some tanks and a fighter jet out front, and a little museum with history about Saigon there. Many conference rooms.

Cathedral/Post Office/Literature street - Took maybe 30 minutes to see all three, adjacent. It was fine! The cathedral had scaffolding when I was there so kind of underwhelming. The book street was only about a block long. The post office had some nice colonial architecture and you can buy and send post cards home there.

War Remnants Museum - A must see. Lures you in with left behind war equipment and then hits you with the atrocities. Particularly for American visitors it provides a really unflinching account of the lasting impact of the war. Also some general exhibits of photos and memorabilia. Heavy stuff but very educational.

Saigon Skydeck in Bitexco Financial Tower Ticket - I tried to go to the cafe on the floor above but it’s been closed for three years so I just paid the admission. It was OK. You’re not on the top, just a floor below the helipad. Cool to see the sprawl of the city and there’s a few free telescopes but that’s about it.

Cafe Apartments- It’s an apartment building converted into cafes, restaurants and little shops. I went to the cafe second from the top and the view was nice from the balcony. There’s an elevator you have to pay for but the stairs were free.

Mekong Delta day tour - Very touristy but it was nice to get out on the water. They just took us across the river to an island and we had some fruit, listened to music, saw a coconut demonstration and ate lunch. I ate rat. They took you in a little boat down a channel and back. Stopped at a buddhist temple on the way back which was really cool. If you want to see the famous floating markets you need to a multi-day trip as it starts very early in the morning.

**Nightlife/Bars**

The Walking Steet - Truly do not see the appeal of this at all. Just depressing and most of the places are dead. If you want to go and meet other people staying at hostels, go to Crazy Night — it’s the only one that actually fills up and everyone is there. Beware the balloons!

TNR Saigon - Shoutout to this bar just off the walking street. I went here most nights. Like impeccable divey bar vibes and a mix of locals and foreigners. They have a pool table and a computer w spotify where anyone can cue up stuff (as long as it’s good hip hop). Was there for their anniversary and they had live local music. Also they take card. Highly recommend!

The Observatory- Didn’t go here, but I heard it’s a good spot if you’re looking for techno or house!

Next Level (Video game bar) - Good selection of games even if the drinks are a little pricey. Owned by an an American expat who tends bar but draws a mix of people. If you want a chill night, nothing like bonding over some smash bros with strangers.

**Food shout outs -**

I mainly just ate street food and drank ca phe sua da from random store fronts. (Learn from my mistakes and do some research, I wish I had done a lot more because there are a ton of interesting food places tucked away that I discovered on [youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/@WhatThePho)later :(   )

**Notes:** Big city vibes! Can be a bit overwhelming at first. Just walk confidently when crossing the street. Nobody wants to hit you either! Most of the tourist stuff is in District 1, but maybe try to visit some other areas!

**Day bus to Nha Trang** - Super chill and comfortable. Bought a ticket from the office that the hostel recommended and the company picked us up from that office the next day and took us to the bus station. It was a sleeper bus and very spacious with private compartments. Make sure to pack snacks, although they usually stop at a bus station so you can load up.

# Nha Trang - three nights

Once again spent longer here than I was planning on. I also skipped Dalat because I was just ready for the beach. In retrospect I think it’s worth doing at least one night there. And if I had more time I would’ve stopped somewhere on the southern coast, like Phan Thiet or Vung Tau.

Beach here was nice if very commercialized! More Virginia Beach than untouched nature, but serviceable! Basically the Russian cabo. There are even signs in Cyrillic.

**Accommodation - Fuse Nha Trang**

Clean and good amenities, but no curtains in my four-person room. Pool on the top floor and a bar/restaurant at the entrance. Staff were great and there were events each night. Lots of British people on vacation type vibe though.

**Attractions -**

Beach - The main reason to come here. It was two blocks from the hostel. You can rent a chair or just chill on the sand or in the line of trees by the edge of the beach. A little bit of trash in the water and on the beach, but I thought it was fine! If you are comfortable riding a scooter you could probably go out of town and find somewhere better, but this is serviceable. Plus you can look across the water at the giant fake Italian town and castle at Vinworld.

Tham Temple - Worth a visit! Not huge, you could walk through in like 30 minutes, but pretty and it’s on a little hill with somewhat of a view. There are signs with qr codes you can scan to do an audio tour. (Although I did have a little bit of a hard time understanding the narrator at points.)

Boat trip - I didn’t actually do this due to timing/being kind of tired, but it seems like the move. The one through the hostel was just getting drunk on a boat and swimming basically, but a good way to meet people and it’s fun!

**Food shoutouts -**

[Bánh Căn, Bánh Xèo chợ đêm Nha Trang - cô Yến..](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DDri2JLNqD96HGtp7) - One of the best meals of the trip! I got the plate of mixed banh can, which was good. But what made the meal incredible was the chili dipping sauce and the slices of shredded mango that you wrap each one up with. Really good flavor combo and sauce, and the people who work there are really nice! It feels like you’re sitting in their front room eating. Highly recommend!

Food stand south of Last Call nightclub across the street at the entrance to an alley - This is probably the best I can describe the location, but I had some divine fried noodles and serviceable fried chicken here on the way home. Their bahn mi’s were also fire. \*Not an objective tasting\*

Honorable mentions: The coffee shop across from the hostel and the corner soup shop. Wouldn’t go out of my way to find these, but solid coffee and nice vibes. And a really tasty Bo Kho at the soup shop.

**Nightlife/bars -**

Honestly I spent too much of this part of the trip hanging out at the hostel bar and with other westerners.

Last Call - This was the club the hostel sent everyone to after the bar closed. Mainly just including for awareness. They only play techno remixes here. Literally didn’t hear a song that was not a remix the entire time I was there. The first night I went there I thought it was cursed. The second night I actually respected it for their commitment to the bit. Classic balloons and lasers and tourists vibe.

**Night bus to Hoi An - Aprox. 8 hours**

I paid extra for the nicer bus, so there were curtains and everything, but less nice than the bus from HCMC to Nha Trang and they didn’t provide a blanket on this one. Didn’t get much sleep between being cold and the bus movement/honking. Arrived 6 am and couldn’t get a Grab bike for a little bit so I just started walking until one was available. Arrived at the hostel totally wrecked but couldn’t check in yet and there wasn’t really anywhere to sleep besides a corner of the bar that was already taken. Overall, would not recommend this experience lol.

# Hoi An - 5 nights (?)

Definitely would’ve spent less time here. I know some people love it but I was ready to leave at the end. I know there’s a big Hoi An/Da Dang debate on here which I’ll go into later, but it really did feel incredibly touristy here to me by the end and that so much of the area I was in was catering to Westerners.

**Accommodations - Bed Station**

Was recommended by a few people and I overall was a fan of the vibes. Definitely a bigger hostel and somewhat of the party crowd, but I also met some good people here! Some mid events at the hostel but that’s fine. Maybe a 20 minute walk from the center of town and you can rent bikes motorized and not. Be warned, no curtains on the beds and the bathrooms/showers are all communal for the floor, but I thought they were quite clean given that and I didn't mind.

**Attractions -**

Old Town/lanterns - Nice to see at night. Didn't get a chance to go in a boat to see them but it seemed nice. Heard from a couple people to make sure you don't get scammed and taken in a boat up the river away from the lanterns. The old town itself was fine, very yellow, but I got over it pretty quickly. Seemed like all the businesses were pretty touristy.

Night Market - Fine. Bog standard night market with the same stuff and food as elsewhere.

Japanese Bridge - This is currently being completely taken apart and reconstructed, basically. They have a viewing spot but there isn't much to see. Wanted to mention because I didn't see anything about this anywhere!

Beach - Didn't spend much time here because of a horrific sun burn, but seemed very nice and was only like a 15 minute bicycle ride from the hostel.

My Son Temple - Highly recommend! Booked a tour from the hostel that included a boat ride back. It was hot and humid as hell in the valley, but very beautiful and temples were really cool, as well as the damage from the American military. Keep in mind that a decent portion of what's there now is reconstruction!

**Food shoutouts -**

Bánh Mì Phượng - Apparently made famous by Anthony Bourdain. I was skeptical but I would say top 3 bahn mi of the trip. Good pate and nice spice. (Was unimpressed by Madam Khanh banh mi, the other famous one.)

9 Cafe Hội An - Wouldn't go out of my way for, but had my favorite salt coffee of the trip here.

**Nightlife/bars -**

There was a strip of bars across the river from the old town that seemed like the main party scene for tourists.

Tiger Bar - This seemed like the most active late night spot for dancing and stuff with other backpackers and tourists.

Mr. Bean Bar - Just including because the bar theme kills me.

**Grab to Da Nang - Aprox. 40 mins**

# Da Nang - 1 Night

Stayed here one night by the airport because I had an early flight. Wish I had spent more time here! Heard so many people complain about how commercialized the beach was and everything, but it is the third largest city in Vietnam. Wish I had spent more time here as the bits I saw felt more like a real city and less like the tourist trappy bits of Hoi An.

**Flight to Bangkok**

Had an early flight and getting through the airport was super easy. I paid for an extra bag and it just made the weight limit (they weighed it at check in).

# Bangkok - 3 nights

Spent some time here waiting for friends. FYI, weed is currently **legal** in Thailand but that is likely to change by the end of the year!

**Accomodation** -

Jam Hostel - two nights

Would recommend. Lowkey, but people seemed friendly enough. Between feeling sick of being around the Northern European party crowd, and feeling sick from actual food poisoning I kept to myself and got some good sleep. (Highly recommend Imodium if you're dealing with diarrhea!! It's a game changer that I wish I had known about sooner. It's over the counter, although I had to visit a few pharmacies to find it.)

In the backpacker area, which isn't super central but is convenient for sight seeing stuff. If you want a pub crawl or party vibe, Mad Monkey is literally next door! (Like literally, they share a wall.)

Mad Monkey - 1 night

Ended up staying an extra night and wanted to do the pub crawl. Stayed in a four person room that was bare bones, but not too bad as hostels go. There’s a pool and a bar downstairs.

**Attractions -**

Malls - Went and walked around the largest malls I've ever seen, even though I couldn't afford anything. One I went to had a bunch of tasty food options spread throughout. Bangkok made me believe in malls again!

Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha- Cool stuff! Great murals and statues and buildings covered in precious metal. Would recommend. Shorts not allowed. Make sure to wear long pants or be prepared to buy some nearby.

Reclining Budhha Temple - So many golden buddhas! The reclining one was really cool! (And huge.)

Museum Siam - Learned how much everybody loves the king! (lol) Could give this a miss.

Talat Noi - Walked around, saw some street art, had some coffee, saw the river. Didn't really get the hype but it was a nice afternoon!

Chinatown Night Market - Walked over from Talat Noi. Lots of good food!

Jodd Fairs Night Market - Definitely fairly touristy but I did enjoy myself at this market. A lot of the same stuff but a few cool stalls with vintage stuff, and lots of food options. A bit out of the way. Had a weed stall.

Bangkok Arts and Culture center - Ended up here by accident because they have a great coffee shop on the ground floor, but the first five stories are a mix of small arts-focused shops, galleries/exhibitions and coffee shops. Top three stories are a free art museum. Had a great time wandering my way up and exploring. Cool view from the floor before the museum and I got some great souvenirs at the official gift shop and one selling stuff from local artists. One of the coolest places I went on my trip!

**Food shoutouts -**

Streetfood - Ofc.

Mama's coffee shop - This coffee shop in Talat Noi might be one of the favorite places I visited. The downstairs entrance is easy to miss, it looks like a building just full of junk, but if you go up the stairs to the left there's a really cool coffee shop with wooden decor, tons of cats on the porch and great coffee. Had a calamansi and espresso drink. It's owned by an older lady from the neighborhood who trains other older people on coffee making apparently.

Guay Jub Ouan Pochana - Hole in the wall spot by Chinatown night market that's Michelin listed. Rolled rice noodle in a black-pepper-heavy broth with fried pork. Felt the first sip in my sinuses, but loved it! So good!

Other coffee shops - Bangkok has a great coffee shop scene IMO. I really liked the one on the ground floor of the arts and culture center and had really tasty coffee jelly there.

**Nightlife/Bars -**

Khaosan Road - The OG bar street. Went on the mad monkey pub crawl but didn't stay too long due to stomach issues. Seemed like the archetypal pub street that everyone else is trying to emulate. Pub crawl was fun and fairly social, but also huge (they said over a hundred people signed up) and like over two-thirds men.

**Grab to Bus to Grab to Motorboat to Ko Lan**

Missed the van to Ko Lan with my friends due to being stuck in the bathroom. Embarked on a half-day odyssey to meet them. There is probably a better way to do this -- but I took a 30 min Grab to the bus station, bought a bus ticket to Pattaya. Once I got there, it turns out the bus station is on the far side of town from the departure pier, so I took another 30-40 min Grab to the pier. The ferry would've been a little cheaper but wasn't running for a while, so I paid a bit more to join a motorboat ride. (If you do this, ignore the people at the start of the pier trying to sell you rides and walk up to one of the departure points yourself. You can look online to see what a fair rate is.)

# Ko Lan - 2 nights

Chill couple days on relatively cute little island. Didn't feel super remote, you're still in view of the buildings of Pattaya, but more of a small town island vibe.

Accommodation - Small local hotel my friends booked.

**Attractions -**

Beach - Went to the beach on the south of the island. A little rocky, but nice. Monkeys at the end of the beach. Expect to pay for a chair and make sure to bring cash if you want to buy food or drinks from the bar/food places there. Not really walking distance from town, but you can pay to ride in a shuttle back.

**Food shout outs -**

Sea food restaurant - Gatekeeping because I can't remember the name or find it on google, but it was on the main drag a little ways up from town. Had a really amazing meal here!

**Nightlife/bars**

Didn't go out, but there was a strip of three open air club/bar spots up the main drag from us. Right on the edge of town Seemed pretty empty. But did buy a pre-roll from the food/weed spot across the street.

**Ferry to van back to Bangkok -**

Pretty straightforward and actually really affordable. Left the ferry pier and walked to a nearby business selling van tickets.

# Bangkok round 2 (Songkran edition) - 3 nights(?)

**Attractions-**

Songkran - Didn't plan this, but ended up being there for the Thai new years festival. There are other elements to it, but the most famous is that it's a huge water gun fight. Surprisingly wholesome and fun!

**Accomodations -**

Hotel - 3 nights

Stayed in a hotel near where my friends were staying. Around $40/night near Chatuchak Market. Room smelled a bit like toilet, but was super nice otherwise.

**Attractions -**

Songkran Festival - My experience was pretty chill. There are areas you can go that are a free-for-all, but my main experience was just seeing people driving by or taking the train wearing floral shirts and carrying water guns slung over their shoulders. There are lots of parties happening that you can go to.

We ended up posting up one night outside a bar near the entrance to a Queer rave by where we were staying and exchanging squirts with people going in and out. I'm sure there are plenty of less wholesome experiences to be had as well!

Chatuchak Market - HUGE weekend market. Wish I could've spent more time exploring, because I only found the section with a ton of good vintage in it towards the end. Make sure to budget plenty of time. Plenty of repetitive touristy stuff but I also saw plenty of cool stuff. Would recommend!

**Food -**

Ong Tong Khao Soi - Went to this place in Ari while wandering around and it was so good! Didn't realize it was so well known, but definitely for good reason. They were also doing a colab with Lays for Khao Soi chips while I was there, which were crazy good!

**Nightlife/Bars** - Not much more to say in this phase. Staying near Ari there were a few bars, but wasn't too crazy.

**Flight to Hanoi to Grab to Bus to Grab to Boat to Bus to Cat Ba Island -** When I left Bangkok I hadn't made up my mind if I wanted to go straight to the Ha Long Bay area or stay in Hanoi first. I couldn't find any info about going direct from the airport, so after a few hours of indecision, I embarked on a loosely planned odyssey.

My plan was to take a bus to Hai Phong and then the ferry to Cat Ba. So, I took a Grab to the Hanoi bus station and was steered to a random bus to Hai Phong. The bus dropped me off on the south end of Hai Phong and I assumed it would be an easy trip to the ferry based on google maps. After several declined Grabs, a driver picked me up, stopped for an oil change and then we embarked on a 40-minute motorbike odyssey through industrial wastes, being buffeted by strong winds the whole time.

Once we reached the ferry dock, I went to board a boat that I thought was the ferry but turned out to be part of a bus service. I paid them cash and they let me join the incredibly short boat ride and then dropped me off at my hostel from the bus.

All this to say, if you're planning on going Cat Ba, just book a ticket through one of the bus companies that leaves from their offices in the Hanoi Old Quarter. It'll take just as long to get to the office from the airport and be way easier and a bit cheaper in the end.

# Cat Ba Island- Two Nights

Didn’t get to spend much time here between my long day getting there and wanting to get back to Hanoi, but really enjoyed it. Wish I could’ve stayed at least one more day to hike in the national park. Weather was also kind of grey when I was there.

**Accommodations -**

Catba Backpackers Hostel Pool and Bar - 2 Nights

I think this hostel used to be a hotel or something? There is bar but it was chill vibes when I was there. Mostly couples and solo travelers. View out the back was solid, but there are plenty of mosquitoes around from pond next door. Wasn’t an issue in the dorms and my bunk was good, if the bathroom was a little odd. I was happy but the biggest thing to keep in mind is that is around a 30 minutes walk from town.

**Attractions-**

Lan Ha Bay Boat tour - Booked this through the hostel. The one I signed up for was supposed to cover both Ha Long Bay and the even larger bay to the east, but due to the weather we ended up just spending the day at the second one. I had no complaints! Incredibly beautiful and not at all overcrowded with people. We got to stop and kayak and swim and see monkeys before park rangers chased us off. Overall a highlight of the trip.

Cat Ba town - Definitely touristy and not much to it, but it was nice to sit on plastic chairs on the road and drink beer next to locals.

**Food -**

I ate at a kebab bahn mi stand and a roast duck place that smelled great - both were underwhelming. So was the vegan bun bo hue I had the next night. (There were multiple vegan restaurants if that’s something you’re looking for.)

**Nightlife/bars -** Could’ve just been when I was there but the few nightlife spots seemed pretty dead. (Aside from the requisite British themed place full of British people getting drunk.)

**Bus to Hanoi**

Booked this through the hostel and they picked us up there. Super easy; they arranged the boat and we were in Hanoi by lunch time. Dropped us off on the edge of the Old Quarter, which was convenient because that’s where most hostels are.

# Hanoi - 5 days(?)

The big city. Lots to see and do here.

**Accommodation** - Hanoi Backpackers Hostel and Rooftop Bar - 4 nights(?)

Booked here because a friend I made was staying here. It was… fine. The rooms were super tiny and cramped. First one I booked was three bunks that took up each wall of a small windowless room. Next one was a 10-12 person room where I basically had to turn sideways to squeeze between the bunk across from me and get into bed. And I was the only bed in the room not occupied by members of a group of British 18 year olds. Fortunately the ac worked.

Definitely a big hostel without a lot of social events besides a twice weekly pub crawl. The roof deck/bar has an amazing view though and would be worth a visit even if you aren’t staying and just want a relatively inexpensive rooftop.

Staff were nice and you can book a Ha Giang Loop tour with them.

Hotel - 2 nights

Was starting to feel under the weather so I booked a hotel in the Old Quarter for two nights. Not a lot of insulation from the bass from the club next door but otherwise nice!

**Attractions/Activities -**

Vietnam National Museum of History - Two buildings. One offers essentially a timeline of Vietnam from the beginning of French occupation through the present day, with a particular focus on the struggle for independence. The second features a wide array of artifacts from Vietnam’s prehistoric civilizations and medieval era.

The second is much richer in artifacts and definitely worth a visit for the ancient bronze work alone. The first has less artifacts but the history is interesting, if one sided. Learn from my mistakes and be sure to allocate enough time if you want to see both. I had to come back to see the second building, and regretted not starting with it.

Ho Chi Minh mausoleum - Important to know: you need long pants and a shirt with sleeves to be allowed in. Also the body is only available to see on limited days a week during specific morning hours, and is taken to Russia during the fall for maintenance. Check on this before visiting! I did not see a lot of information about this and wasted time as a result!! There is a museum about HCM’s life there as well, but it closes for lunch around noon.

Yen Phu Street Vintage shopping/Island - Struggling to find the name, but there's a little island/peninsula that'll you find if you search the Yen Phu area on Google maps.

The island was nice to walk around. I went during midday so it was pretty quiet but there were plenty of spots to grab a coffee or beer along the water. The vintage shop on the back side had a really nice selection at what I would call very fair prices, aka don’t expect any crazy deals but good stuff at solid prices. There’s a stretch of vintage stores along the main Yen Phu road behind that’s nice to check out.

But special shoutout to **Dia Than Vintage** (Dia Than means record), which is an amazing little record store along there. Tons of Japanese imports and generally great finds at great prices. When I was there the owner was djing fire records in the store and is a really nice guy to talk to. Apparently he’s done a lot to promote vinyl culture in Vietnam and DJ’s events locally.

Hỏa Lò Prison - Big crowds and pretty underwhelming. Interesting to see the actual cells, and the terrible conditions the French held people in, but the interpretative cards were somewhat repetitive. (Apparently the American POWs had a great time.) Once you’ve seen it you’ve seen it.

Vietnam National Fine Arts Museum - Had a nice wander around. Some cool historic sculptures and artifacts, and a lot of revolutionary art. A chill afternoon stop.

Train Street - Was going to skip but happened to pass through when a train was coming. Actually pretty sick to sit next to the moving train!! You will have to get something from a cafe or bar to sit there though. There are some kind of security at one end that only let you in if you were going to a specific bar or cafe, but we just walked around to the other end and walked right in.

Old Quarter Night Market - Standard night market. The same knock offs and food you’ll find at any other basically.

St. Joseph's Cathedral - Passed the outside and was largely underwhelmed. Maybe cooler on the inside?

**Food/Cafes** -

(Lots of great cafes that I did not mention. Take your pick!)

Banh mi stand halfway up beer street - Ok this has to be shared. There are many banh mi stands, but if you go one block up the ""beer street"" to the intersection in the center there is a stand run by a woman who looks to be in like her 30s. THIS IS THE SPOT! I can’t offer a totally objective (sober) opinion, but I and everyone else who I took there over multiple visits thought it was one of the best banh mi’s we’ve had. I got the chicken banh mi and each element was delicious (the pickled veggies had a horseradish note?) and she toasted the sandwich on a little stove. Big recommend!! (I also tried the really famous banh mi spot in the Old Quarter and was generally underwhelmed.)

Tầm vị- A little in the fancier side but definitely still reasonably priced. Beautiful decor, it’s like an old traditional house with greenery. Really tasty food.

Bun Cha Ta Hanoi - Hostel employee recommended and it was great! A really nice place to try this bun dish. You basically get noodles and meat and other garnishes and mix them dip them in a tasty sauce.

Pizza 4P's - I mainly went here because of the legend who listed it as their food choice in every town in their trip report on here lol, but it was great! Definitely a little fancy and expensive, but great pizza and they have a number of pizzas that are takes on local dishes!

Bánh Đa Cua cô Thơm- Idk if my body was just craving greens, but I really enjoyed the dish I had this hole in the wall spot. It was like thick noodles, with greens and fish cake and sausage!

Tranquil Books Cafe - The name says it all! I think there’s two storefronts near each other and the one I went to is tucked down an alleyway next to a jazz club. Great vibes!

Hidden Gem Cafe - Cool location! One of the many tucked away cafes. Wasn’t crazy about the coffee and they forgot my sandwich, but worth it for the vibes.

C.O.C Legacy Specialty Coffee - Another cute hidden location. Great spot for coffee nerds.

Cafe Phố Cổ - To get here you enter through a tailor shop and into a courtyard. Amazing view of the famous center lake from the top floor.

The Note Coffee - Famous because you can leave post its on every surface. I was kind of underwhelmed. Seems like they clear out the post it’s every so often so they only really went back like a year. My frozen coffee was also underwhelming. A nice gimmick to check out though.

Pho 10 Ly Quoc Su - Pretty good. A famous pho shop. It was busy but quick service. I enjoyed the pho w garlic added.

**Nightlife/bars** - Mainly just went out on the bar street in the Qld Quarter. Classic backpacker party scene. There’s an area to the north known as West Lake where a lot of expats go out apparently.

**Flight to HCMC to Korea to US**

If you’re flying out of HCMC make sure to allocate enough time. There was a big line at outbound immigration control. (Hadn’t experienced such a thing before.)

# General thoughts

Overall an amazing trip and I definitely want to go back. There was a much larger presence of British and Dutch partiers than I expected?? And a large number of bars etc catering to them. At one point I realized I'd heard sweet caroline more than any local song. Just something to keep in mind when evaluating hostels. I enjoyed myself more around other solo travels who were open to adventures.

I do also wish I had made more of an effort to immerse myself in the local culture and learn the local language. Someone on here said not to bother trying to learn a tonal language and just use google translate, may be true but it's also the worst advice I received. I had a one night layover in HCMC city and ate at a stand with locals I couldn’t understand at all. It was one of the most humbling, but invigorating experiences of the trip — and one I wish I had sought out more.

**Places I heard good things about but didn't visit:**

Ninh Bin - Super beautiful and lowkey

Hà Giang Loop - It’s becoming more and more popular, but I only heard good things.

Da Lat - Skipped because I wanted to go straight to the coast, but apparently there’s some cool hostels and hiking. Becoming more developed though.

Really anywhere else - There's so much in Vietnam. I've seen people say to just talk to people along the way. That's very helpful, but I would definitely recommend also getting a good guidebook or looking at info online.

**Logistics**

**SIM card -** I got one with a five-day expiration at the airport when I arrived for around $10 USD I think? Then I went to Viettel and got a data-only card for 30 days for around the same price. Super straightforward and I was even able to get imessage working over data to text with people back home.

**Grab -** Basically it's like Uber. You can call a car or motorbike to pick you up. Super easy to use and you can pay through it. Ignore people who try to solicit you to go with them even if they say they're with Grab and double check the license plate is correct.

A note on bikes: I was kind of apprehensive at first, but then became a huge fan of riding on the back of Grab bikes. It's cheaper and faster and I never felt unsafe in Vietnam. The driver usually had a helmet for me to wear and speeds weren't fast enough to feel scary. There are foot rests for you on the bike and handholds underneath the seat usually. Just be careful of the exhaust pipe, it's very hot. I will say things did feel a bit less safe in Bangkok because more of the rides were on actual motorcycles not scooters, but in Vietnam it always felt fine.

**Imodium -** I ate a ton of street food and was generally fine so I wouldn't worry too much as long as you use common sense, but food poisoning isn't an uncommon issue. I found Imodium to be a lifesaver for diarrhea.  Take the initial two pills and then keep taking it each time you have to go to the bathroom until the diarrhea stops (per the instructions). I found it took three or four pills before the levels kicked in for me.

There's some stuff online about not taking it for food poisoning. Ignore that. The current recommendation from medical experts is to keep taking it as long as needed in cases of for travelers diarrhea (within the daily limits).

A pharmacist did also give me a liquid clay treatment that's apparently more common in Asia and it seemed to work when I took it for a second bout of symptoms, so whatever works! (Someone in the comments found it, the brand name is Smecta.)

**Bathrooms -** On that note, I would recommend getting used to the everpresent Bidet hoses as soon as possible. They're great and you never know when you'll stumble into a bathroom equipped with only that.

As a final, obligatory disclaimer this is my 100% subjective experience as a white American man in his late 20s. I’m sure there’s plenty I missed and I can’t speak for anyone else’s experiences. I hope this is just a helpful starting point to making your own experiences. Please feel free to roast me in the comments!!",2024-08-19 09:01:07
solotravel,1evu77g,Social solo travelers - do you ever get a bit anxious when arriving to a new place?,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1evu77g/social_solo_travelers_do_you_ever_get_a_bit/,16,"I’m relatively extroverted, but every time I go to a new hostel (especially after meeting good people in previous place), I always get a little anxious.

That first step into a new hostel is always a bit intimidating for me.

- Sometimes everyone is already in groups
- Sometimes everyone is just on their phone/airpods in
- Sometimes there’s just not many people there at the moment

These situations can be a bit difficult as a traveler who derives a lot of happiness when traveling from connecting with others 

Do any of you guys ever feel this anxiety (esp those of you who are less extroverted)? I know re: the point about people already being in groups, you can usually interrupt and ask to join (though takes some courage) and people are usually nice, but how do you navigate the other two situations if you want to be social? 

If your hostel isn’t doing it for you socially, are there any other things you do to meet others?",2024-08-19 05:39:13

I wasn’t supposed to be in Spain. I initially had a bikepacking trip in the balkans planned out but things went south when I broke my rib a day before my flight and couldn’t board because I was stuck in the hospital. After a few days rest I decided I’m not going to sit around for the entire month of august that my work allowed me to use as vacation, so booked the cheapest flight which was to Barcelona. 

I’m 12 days into my trip, and I have been bedridden for 6 of those days. 5 days of having the worst flu of my life (probably from partying too hard in Barcelona), and now today after getting food poisoning. 

I came to Spain with absolutely zero plans, but every time I scoped out something cool to do, like hike the Sierra Nevada, plans go south and I end up stuck in bed unable to move. 

I’ve found the humour in all this because it’s been a 6 month mental journey at home of decision making and back and forth on whether to do it or not. I’m not quite sure what to make of this but just wanted to share my experience so far of my first time solo travelling. ",2024-08-19 19:15:46

I'm 3.5 months into a 5.5 month solo travel adventure. In June, while I was in Poland, it started to really heat up in the Balkans which was the next stop on my journey.  Being from Seattle and kind of a heat wimp, I cancelled my reservations and went to Normandy, the UK and Ireland instead. Which was absolutely the right call as it was a perfect 22-25c with lite rain occasionally (ahhh... my climate!) while it was 40c and baking in Bosnia and Serbia. Not to mention I had the absolute best time in Normandy (best part of the trip so far) and the UK.  I'm currently in Istanbul and I am trying to finalize the Balkans portions.  I will now arrive in Serbia on Aug 31 staying until Sept. 15 then into Montenegro.  I'm booked in Podgorica from Sept. 15th to the 18th as basically a pitstop on my way to the Adriatic Coast.  

This is where I need your help; apportioning the time in Kotor, Budva, Tirana and Sarande. I'm booked in Corfu from14th of Oct. to the 17th when I catch a flight to Frankfurt for my return to Seattle on October 18th. Right now this is what I'm thinking:



Podgorica to Kotor on Sept 18th.  Stay until the 23rd.

Kotor to Budva on Sept. 23rd, stay until the 29th.

Budva to Tirana on Sept. 29th, stay until Oct. 7th 

Tirana to Sarande on Oct 7th stay until Oct. 14th and then catch the ferry to Corfu.

Here are the things I am looking for; I'm slow traveling, so I take my time, don't like to plan stuff every day.  When I do things, I tend to focus on historical attractions, for example history museums and historical sites.  I like casual entertainment like sidewalk cafes, pubs with outdoor seating for good people watching and reading my kindle. Not much into clubs or wild party scene. I do like beaches and the ocean, but not so much for laying and tanning, but for swimming.  Am I spending too much time in Tirana and should spend more time in Sarande or is Vlore worth stopping in?  Are there other cities/towns in Montenegro and Albania worth visiting?    Would love to hear some suggestions.

I am probably over budgeting but I've been dreaming of visiting for a long time.  I don't stay in hostels and prefer hotels. 

A lot of suggestions seem to involve a lengthy stay in the capital of Reykjavik.  I would like to visit there if course but really want to see the famous nature sites like the waterfalls, lagoons, and other remoter areas such as offshore islands. This includes maybe squeezing in a scuba dive or boat ride.  

Is it better to do everything via a tour bus or rent a car?  How many days ideally in Reykjavik? ",2024-08-19 16:01:58

I've only ever did solo travel by public transport or day trips so I've always been able to snap all the photos that I want on the road.

But unless there are rest spots by the road, it feels like I won't be able to take as many photos as I want while driving solo?

Sorry if this seems like a silly concern, I've not driven overseas before or on long trips. Thinking if it might be better to take public transport in some places and rent a bike instead so that I can stop wherever I want. ",2024-08-19 02:35:13

I’m worried that it will be way too much to handle as what i struggle with the most is social interaction, I’ve had social anxiety for most of my life. I don’t get overstimulated particularly but I do find myself getting overwhelmed with things quicker than normal. My biggest concerns are just general interactions with people, eating in restaurants, finding bathrooms, moving between cities, buying things etc, I struggle with these things at home for the most part.
I don’t really know what else to do is going alone is my only option, anyone with experience or guidance would be much appreciated ",2024-08-18 20:14:25

After putting the work in at the gym, I'm feeling more normal than I have in a very long time. I'm celebrating that fact with an 8-week trip in Japan and New Zealand.

However, I don't see it as feasible to maintain my gym schedule whilst I'm away, or frankly even keep an eye on my nutrition that much. How much of my gains do I stand to lose?

I really want to focus on enjoying my trip and not running around at 10pm looking for protein shakes, or finding a gym at short notice. But I'm afraid of how much progress I might lose.",2024-08-18 08:20:15

I reached a point where I literally offered two friends to come for free but unfortunately logistics were unable to be worked out with such short notice. I’m kinda dreading the driving solo just because it sounds lonely. But I cannot think of a destination that is high on my list that would be fun alone.

solotravel,1ev98zp,Trip report: Zagreb-Ljubljana-Bled-Munich-Prague,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ev98zp/trip_report_zagrebljubljanabledmunichprague/,9,"Yo guys!

Im a hungarian guy (23) who wanted to go on a solo trip, with a single backpack. My budget was kinda meh, so I chose buses and hostels for the trip. I started to check Flixbus for prices, I have checked like 50-100 destinations, and then I finalized my destinations.

Budapest-Zagreb-Ljubljana-Bled(daytrip)-Munich-Prague-Budapest

I wanted to chose cities with like 6 hours far with bus. And I wanted to avoid expensive countries like France, Germany, but Munich seemed reasonable, if I wanted to go around like a circle. 

So the bus ticket prices (euros):

Budapest-Zagreb: 38€

Zagreb-Ljubljana: 15€

Ljubljana-Bled: 2x 4€

Ljubljana-Munich: 31€

Munich-Prague: 25€

Prague-Budapest: 29€

I have chosen hostels, I tried them before, it was kinda fun experience, and I spend most of my time in the cities, so I just sleep there, so it can be the cheapest, that was my plan. I reserved pretty late, so the prices are a bit higher what I originally planned, it is what it is.

Hostels (per night):

Zagreb: Palmers Lodge Zagreb (31€) - I expected a cooler place, but for 1 night is more than enough, bit expensive but the location is good

Ljubljana: Simbol Apartments (28,6€) - Far from the city centre, but its kinda good, with own bathroom

Munich: Wombat’s City Hostel Munich Haptb. (34€) - Best hostel I have ever been. Lovely people, live music sometimes, own bar. The room had own bathroom as well

Prague: Florenc Hostel (26€) - It felt like I was alone at the hostel, not so popular I guess, but its fine, with great breakfast. It has fun things aswell, like table football, ping pong..

My review about the cities

**Zagreb**

The vibes are great felt like Budapest but I also felt the balkan vibe aswell. I started just walking around and I noticed a lot of graffities, almost every building has it, but its not the nice one, its just simply ugly. I went to a park for a quick lunch what I took, just a few trees not the best in summer, I had to sit on a bench next to the pavement. Then I went to Ban Jelacic square, everywhere is concrete, not too cozy. Then I went to Nikola Tesla museum, it was suprisingly good, the ticket was 4€ worth it for sure, Lot of things like engines, moon walker, planes, everything. Then i went to the Broken relationship museum, expected more, It was so hyped here in Reddit, but it was meh for me, short. It was emotional for sure, maybe the hype ruined for me I still dont know.

**Ljubljana**

The city centre with the bridges, the river the market is great, felt really good vibes. Everyone has an E-bike, its actually crazy, just a few cars on the road. Not much to do there, I think 1 or maximum 2 nights here is enough

**Bled**

Its magical, like a dream. Easy to reach with local train. There are multiple free beaches, I actually didnt know u can do that here. Easy to walk around the lake, there are boats to go to the church (18€), maybe worth a shot. Bled is unmissable.

Slovenia is a bit more expensive than expected. And almost everything is closed on sunday, be ready for that.

**Munich**

Its crazy good, the architecture is great, every building looks awesome. Beergartens are so cool, always full, everyone is drinking beers. BMW Welt is good, I only visited the free part, Museum ticket price is 12€, felt a bit too much I skipped it, but Im sure its great. Went to Allianz Arena, if you go there, buy the 25€ ticket, with the guided tour, because u can go ""deeper"" in the stadium, the museum part is great, bit far from the city centre. Englischer Garten, Olympia park, both is great, but u can chill next to the river aswell. Great places to relax. Really expensive, but worth it, one of the best city I have ever been. Must see as Bled.

**Prague**

I was a bit tired in Prague, so I was lazy, but went to the famous places. Great atmosphere, a LOT of tourists, bit annoying but it is what it is. Very cheap country, especially the beers. The old town of Prague is beautiful, Charles bridge is insane as well, I loved this city too. Payment is bit harder with card here maybe, I had some sad experiment with that.

I’m looking for some advice or recommendations on solo travel companies that cater specifically to seniors (65+) preferably women-only groups.

My mom is 74 and she’s finally ready to take her dream trip to Ireland, which will be her first time traveling internationally. She’s a bit of a homebody and as a result, a bit socially anxious, so I’m hoping to find a travel company that offers trips for single seniors only, where she can connect with women her age.

Most companies I’ve seen mix age groups or include men/couples, but I think being with a group of similar-aged women could make her feel more comfortable and help her enjoy the experience even more. Any recommendations or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

solotravel,1evn1fr,Looking for feedback on my 1-year trip! :),1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1evn1fr/looking_for_feedback_on_my_1year_trip/,1,"Hi, I am a 24M from London taking a year out to solo travel. This will be my first time going solo, I'm looking for any critique, guidance, or feedback on my trip and open to any suggestions. I have tried planning this with the weather/seasons in mind and incorporated advice from online.

For context, I am:

* Physically fit.
* Love sports, hiking, and being active. I have limited.
* Really enjoy cooking.
* Super interested in unique experiences and new cultures.
* Enjoy socialising and drinking.
* More than happy to sleep in basic accommodation like camping and hostels etc.
* Will have £25-30,000 saved for the trip.
* Can drive, and planning to have a first motorcycle lesson and CBT course next month. I plan to take out a 1968 International Drivers Permit which applies to the majority of the countries I am visiting.  
* I have booked a travel vaccine consultation with superdrug to go through my destinations and get the appropriate vaccines. This seems convenient for me but may be overpriced?
* Will investigate visas next month.

All I have booked so far is a flight to Hanoi, Vietnam for the end of October, so I am still flexible and open-minded to changing plans. I want to start in SE Asia as I feel this is very receptive for western travellers and is a good way to find my feet when learning to solo travel. I don't have much of a rigorous plan for SE Asia and am likely to just go with the flow at hostels as I'm sure I will meet people and join into short term groups to explore places.

Before getting into my itinerary, I have a bit of a conundrum with my plan for SE Asia. Originally I was going to go Vietnam -> Cambodia -> Laos -> Thailand -> Singapore . However, some friends will be in Thailand for December so I am thinking to change this to Vietnam -> Thailand -> Cambodia -> Laos -> Singapore, but this be going back on myself. Although this disjoints my travel route I think Thailand would be better for the Christmas/NYE celebrations. I'm not sure if I should stick to Cambodia/Laos as the benefits are that I'll have a better route and avoid Thailand if its mega busy at that time. Please let me know your thoughts on this. 

An alternative is to do Vietnam -> Thailand -> Singapore -> Indonesia/Sri Lanka. I have omitted Indonesia/Sri Lanka from my current plans - are they worth going to and specifically better than Cambodia/Laos?

Anyway, my current **itinerary** is below. Please note that I won't necessarily be doing everything listed and I imagine I will be skipping some as I am slowly overplanning this trip I think:

1. **Vietnam** - 1 month (*end of October - end of November*)
   * Working my way down from the North to the South
   * Hanoi
   * Ha Giang Loop (getting sleeper bus back up to the North)
   * Ho Chi Minh
   * Sapa
   * Hoi An
2. **Thailand** - 1 month (*December*)
   * Tipsy tubing in Pai, Northern Thailand.
   * Bangkok - Visit the Grand Palace, Wat Pho.
   * Chiang Mai - Visit Doi Suthep Temple, explore the night bazaar, cooking class?
   * Towards the end of the month go to the islands to the south - Phuket, Koh Samui, or Krabi for beaches, island-hopping, and full moon party / Jungle party.
3. **Cambodia & Laos** - 4-6 weeks (*January - mid Feb*)
   * Arcadia Backpackers and water park
   * Siem Reap
   * Vang Vieng hot air balloon
   * Kayaking on the Nam Ou River
4. **Singapore** - 1 week (*end of Feb*)
   * Meet up and crash with a close friend who's living there and be shown around by him.
5. **Nepal** -  4 weeks (*March*)
   * Kathmandu valley 2 weeks - visit Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple), Pashupatinath, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Holi colour festival
   * Hiking 2 weeks  - either do the Three Passes or the Annapurna Circuit. I ideally want to do this without a guide as I will be paying for several guided tours later in the itinerary. Is this achievable? My main concerns are getting lost on the trail or struggling to find accommodation.
6. **Pakistan** - 4 weeks (*April*)
   * Karakoram Highway - 2 weeks hiking up the old silk road starting from Islamabad and ending in the Khunjerab Pass. [Link for website](https://www.bucketlistly.blog/posts/karakoram-highway-guide-2-weeks-itinerary).
   * Not sure whether to explore other areas of Pakistan after this, or to leave it open and take as long as I want on the Karakoram Highway.
7. **Free time for wandering** - 3 weeks (**May**)
   * I don't know what I want to do with this time period. I currently think I will leave it empty and play it by ear, based on suggestions of people I meet. I am leaning towards finishing the Karakoram Highway and exploring the Stans (Tajikistan or Kyrgyzstan) although most of what I read online says you need a guide and car hire which seems expensive.
8. **Cape Town, South Africa** - 1 week (e*arly June*)
   * I may just go to South Africa earlier instead of the Stans. I feel this would be good fun in the hostels and being in a city drinking & socialising after 2.5 months of hiking. Would people recommend it in Cape Town and anything in particular?
9. **Africa Overland Tour from Cape Town to Zanzibar** - 41 days (*early June - mid July*)
   * Camping trip in a group with a team of guides. Will cost approx £6,000 inclusive of tips, food, accommodation, and extras.
   * Route is from South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, ending in Zanzibar.
   * Full of loads of sight seeing and activities such as Fish River Canyon, Sossusvlei, Sesriem, Cape Cross Nature Reserve, Etosha National Park, Okavango Delta, Chobe National Park, Victoria Falls, Masvingo - Great Zimbabwe Ruins, South Luangwa National Park, Mikumi National Park.
10. **Zanzibar** - 2 weeks (*end of July*)
   * Stay in a hostel for 2 weeks recovering and unwinding from the lengthy camping and driving. 
   * Visit the beaches, spice farms, get cooking lesson.
11. **Tanzania** - 2 weeks (*early August*)
   * Climb Kilimanjaro through the Lemosho route for 8 days.
   * Will cost approx £1,800
12. **Kenya** - 4 weeks (*mid August - mid September*)
   * Explore Nairobi for 2 weeks staying in a hostel. Any suggestions? 
   * Potentially climb Mount Kenya, I've heard good things but unsure. Will require a guided tour so probably another £1,500. Will likely decide if I do this nearer the time depending on my finances.
   * Maasai Marai tour for 1 week in early September to see the great wildebeest migration. This is a bit of a bucket list item for me and the dates line up very well. Quite costly again though.
13. **Fly home**

Thank you very much for taking the time to read all of this if you have made it this far!

Please do give me any tips on great hostels, apps, websites, useful items to pack etc. that you would recommend.

Many thanks.",2024-08-18 23:20:33

I'm trying to finalize some excursions/tours for my first trip to Colombia next week and could use some help.  
My accommodations and flights are already booked and I have an idea on what I want to do but would like some feedback on whether or not I should look for guided tours or if I'll be able to enjoy the experiences without a guided tour.  
For context, I'm 29m and will be mostly solo but will meet up with 1 or 2 friends in Medellin and Bogota. My Spanish is decent from living in Mexico (on and off) for a year.

Itinerary (so far):  
Sat: Arrive in Cartagena at around noon and explore the walled city (staying in hostel within walled city).

Sun: Day trip to Islas del Rosario (most likely through Viator).

Mon: \~4 hour bus ride to Santa Marta (staying in hostel).

Tue: Day trip to Tayrona (most likely Viator).

Wed: Morning flight from SMR to PEI (staying in hostel in Salento). Finca el Ocaso tour (2pm - 5pm).

Thur: Early morning Jeep ride to Cocora Valley.

Fri: Working (remotely) for first half, explore Salento second half.

Sat: Noon flight to Medellin (staying in hostel). Explore the city. Bar hopping.

Sun: Comuna 13 (guided tour).

Mon: Guatapé day trip (guided tour).

Tue - Fri: Working during the day and exploring the city in the evenings. Fly to Bogota Fri evening.

Sat - Mon: See as much of the city I can, eat as much food as humanly possible. Fly home on Mon.

(I'm debating if I should skip Rosario Islands and head towards Santa Marta from Cartagena a day ealier and checking out Minca).  
I'm also open to any other suggestions on how I can make the most out of my trip. Gracias!",2024-08-18 20:10:13

solotravel,1eug6s7,"Been in Giza for 2 days and have 2 more weeks in Egypt, here's how I feel ",313,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eug6s7/been_in_giza_for_2_days_and_have_2_more_weeks_in/,188,"Coming to Egypt has been one of my childhood dreams since before I can remember, and now I'm finally here as of 2 days ago. As many people know tho, many of the reviews of Egypt put it in a very negative light and throughout my holiday in Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, and Jordan. Pretty much everyone I have met has not said anything good about Egypt.

I'm staying right next to the pyramids and I will never get tired of my view. Yesterday I went into the complex and took the whole day there. I overpaid for everything I think, definitely spent way too much money and if I'm being honest it kind of took away from the experience and my dreams as a kid. I was expecting it so it didn't annoy me that much but still. The worst was an older man that shoved a packet of pyramids in my hand and demanded money as a ""tip"" even tho he said they were a gift and even after I said I dont want anything. 

Today I went to Saqqara, Memphis, and Dashur and the end of this story is what has really put me in a bad mood. The tour I went on was great, private driver and tour guide and all by myself. Honestly, the places we visited were better than the pyramids of giza imo. Halfway through we visited a carpet school. It was cool, but again, at the end they really pushed me to buy something and because I'm really bad at saying no (even tho sometimes it seems like they won't let you leave) I bought a small rug for a semi-decent price. Then at the end of the tour we went to a Papyrus factory and this is where I started to get pissed off. Went in, got showed how everything was made and then of course they wanted me to buy something. I said I wanted a small judgement piece and he quotes me 6850LE. No. Fucking. Chance. I said no, too much. ""OK I ask my boss"", comes back 20% off. I said no again and tried explaining that its too much money for me (I only work part time back in Australia and make minimum wage so it took me a lot of time to save to come here). So he went 25%,30%,30% + free gift. No no no. Then I said I just want some bookmarks for 500LE which was still probably too much but I genuinely did want something. Then he goes ""OK, bookmarks and papyrus"" and starts the whole thing again. Anyways, I DID buy the Papyrus after he basically gave me more than 50% off the original price and the bookmarks for free.

After this I thought we were going to my hotel but my guide asked me to see his brothers shop, I said it's ok and we went. Initially I thought maybe he'd show me around and that's it. Got there and bang, asked me for 2000LE for a hieroglyph necklace which was admittedly very nice. This is where I got pissed off. I told him ""I've spent too much money today, so I don't want to buy anything else"" and he goes ""what, how much you spend? 1 million"" in a joking manner. But how the hell am I supposed to explain to people here that I'm not rich. I get that I am considered rich here, but that really rubbed me the wrong way and I felt like my guide only brought me there to buy stuff because he saw me buy things at the other 2 places. 

The tour was amazing but that end bit like really set me off. I really don't want to dislike Egypt but when I'm made to feel like I'm getting used what am I supposed to do.

Is there any way I can combat this? I know from now I'm going to say no and walk away because I end up feeling bad and like I have an obligation to spend money.",2024-08-17 12:10:03

I'm a 35 yo woman, EU nationality, and for a while now I've been forced to take a long break from work due to medical reasons. I do however get a stable income based on my previous salary. My chronic illness allows me to travel for short periods of time. 

This is a trip I want to take in order to prove to myself that I don't have to depend on my husband or friends/family all the time while living with my condition (an easier form of epilepsy). I've traveled solo before within the EU. 
Now...I've watched a lot of documentaries about border control, read a lot as well, and it seems that a common question the immigration officers ask is what you do for a living. 
I currently paint and sell some of the paintings, but it's not stable income. I also don't want to say I'm unemployed without extra explanation, but if I explain, they might ask about my illness and I don't really want to talk about it as they might consider me a risk, or not grant access into the country for my own safety.

No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find an appropriate answer for this question, ""what do you do?"" 

For those of you who have traveled without a job, how did you pass immigration? I'd really appreciate some advice.

Thank you!

Edit: thank you so much for your answers! 

For clarification, I am Romanian. Romanian passport holders are a problem to Mexico because of illegal immigration, theft, human trafficking and such. There are multiple cases of Romanians that have not been permitted entry even with a stable job and correct paperwork. 
I've been living in the Netherlands for nine years, and my Dutch naturalization is being processed at the moment. I might have my Dutch passport by then, so I will use that one. Someone was in the same situation and she was asked, ""Why do you have a German passport if you were born in Romania?"" Which is why I want to be thoroughly prepared.",2024-08-18 01:27:14

Nine weeks ago, I had foot surgery (bunions) and I've only been walking in regular sneakers for about a week. Every step still hurts, and I'm slower than usual, but I can manage around 10,000 steps a day.

Normally, I love to travel from city to city, exploring on foot and hiking a lot, but I'm worried that I might not be able to do that right now. While my foot may improve over the next few weeks, I don't want to rely on that. So, I've been considering whether a resort vacation or something similar might be a better alternative this time.

I'm from Europe and would prefer not to fly more than 6 hours at the moment. The weather in early October isn't ideal for a classic beach vacation everywhere. I've thought about some island hopping in Greece (flying to Athens and visiting 1-2 islands), but I'm feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed, even though I'm incredibly grateful to be walking again without crutches or special shoes.

Do you have any destination tips, ideas, or inspiration for me and my healing foot?

solotravel,1evtyoa,Messed Up on my Trip Planning :(,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1evtyoa/messed_up_on_my_trip_planning/,25,"Hey guys I’m on my first solo trip currently in Thailand and I feel like I messed up big time on my planning so just wanna come on here and talk about what’s happened so far. I first came to Thailand on August 4th for a three week backpacking trip. Had a solid plan: First three days in Bangkok, then five days in Chiang Mai, a week in the South and then back to Bangkok for another few days before flying home. Sounds pretty great right? I thought so too. So my first week or so was absolutely fantastic. Loved the food and night life in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Was meeting so many cool folks in the hostel and really loving solo traveling life. Seeing all the cool sights in Bangkok and hiking a ton in Chiang Mai and hanging out with my new friends! Was loving it. While in Chiang Mai a few friends offered for me to come to Pai with them, but unfortunately I had already booked a flight to Phuket and then from Phuket to Bangkok. I thought about saying fuck it and going anyways and skipping the south, but I decided not to. Said goodbye to my new friends and flew to Phuket. My plan for the south was to go to Koh Phi Phi and then back to Phuket and then back to Bangkok, but when I got to both of those places I really hated them both. Phi phi was a bit crowded for my taste and Phuket was just also not hitting the same as the north. 
         So I haphazardly looked online for the nearest island I could go to for a few days to hopefully save the rest of my trip, and ended up on Koh Lanta. Now this island isn’t the worst, but definitely not the best. Lots of moterbiking around, but the hostel vibes are not the same and I’m very sad about not going to Pai with my new friends. Now I feel like I’m stuck on this boring island when I could be doing much for fun stuff. Having major FOMO but still trying to make the best of it. I would leave and go to another part of the south, but I have my flight back to Bangkok in two days and already booked a 45£ boat ride on Wednesday that I can’t refund (it’s Monday). I know that this is such a first world problem like boo hoo “American backpacker goes to the wrong beautiful tropical island and has slightly less fun than he expected to had but still has a good time” but I saved for a long time for this trip and really wanted to make each part really magical for myself. Part of me thinks this was a learning experience to maybe choose one region of a country and just explore that as well as not plan too far in advance so you can be spontaneous. Does anyone have any experience or kind words they can share that could help me in this weird time?

solotravel,1evr9yu,I don't get why you people skip Guatemala City.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1evr9yu/i_dont_get_why_you_people_skip_guatemala_city/,18,"I flew down to Guatemala early this morning. Instead of heading straight to Antigua, I spent several hours wandering around Guatemala City, walking from the airport to the historical district. Safety didn't seem to be a major concern in that part of town. It doesn't quite have the architecture of Antigua, but there are certainly some pretty areas worth taking in. More importantly, GC's historical district is extremely lively. In the short time I was there, I saw a free concert in the park, some guys dressed as the Mario Bros, and some teenagers doing a rap battle. Also there's a Denny's.

10/10 would recommend.",2024-08-19 02:49:30

solotravel,1euvpi8,Critique my solo travel plan! ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1euvpi8/critique_my_solo_travel_plan/,25,"I’m preparing for my first solo travel experience - I’m not usually a planner but I’m extremely overwhelmed, so I figured creating a spreadsheet with a general sense of everything I should know would be helpful. I don't know how to share the excel sheet, so I'm just going to translate the information here. I'm primarily concerned if the order of which I'm visiting the countries makes sense geographic wise and weather wise. For context, I'm a US citizen.

- October to December: Starting with Southeast Asia (Thailand, then Vietnam, Indonesia, and finally Singapore). 

- January to February: Travel to Japan for 2 weeks (Tokyo and Kyoto mostly) then to South Korea for 2 weeks (Seoul).

- February to March: End my travel with Europe (Spain, Portugal, and Amsterdam, probably 1.5 weeks in each) before returning to the US.

Vaccinations: Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, polio

As far as I'm aware, Vietnam is the only country I'll need a visa for. 

Does anything here look wonky? I tried to base the schedule around weather and how heavy tourism is during each time period. I also put the countries in order of when I'd visit, but if it makes sense to visit in a different order, please let me know. 

Am I trying to fit in too many countries? I can add a little time on, but my goal is to be done before the summer months. 

Do you think this is possible on a $7,500 budget? I would definitely be staying in hostels and being as frugal as possible, but do you think I should increase the budget if I really want to make the most of my time?

Thank you!!!",2024-08-17 23:55:11
solotravel,1eu5621,London as a Frugal Traveler ,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eu5621/london_as_a_frugal_traveler/,63,"Hello! I (33F, American) just wrapped up a 6-day solo trip in London.  I frequently travel solo, and try my best to be frugal (to me, this means looking for value in money spent).  London is an expensive city, but doable on a budget. I did not see many posts on this type of travel when researching my trip, so wanted to share some insight for fellow frugal-minded and/or solo travelers.  

Overall Impression: 

* London was very safe, and getting around was incredibly easy.  With attentiveness, you should not fear being pick-pocketed. Don’t be flashy, and keep a hand on your belongings.  

*The bus system and tube was beyond easy to navigate - just plug your destination into Google Maps (I did not use City Mapper, so cannot give feedback or a comparison between the two). An Oyster card is unnecessary if you have a form of contactless payment. Any credit card will work (use the same one throughout your trip to ensure you hit the TFL daily/weekly cap).  Don’t do this if your CC charges foreign transaction fees.  Several days I only took the bus, so only spent $6.50 all day. The tube is a bit more expensive. 

* London has global cuisine options. Take advantage! I ate super well and spent about $50-60 per day (including water and snacks). One meal per day was a “splurge.”

*I stayed in an AirBnb in Stoke Newington, which required about 45-60 minutes to get to my starting destination each day, about $500 (6 nights). Central London was way outside of my budget.  That being said, as I moved around all day, it took about 30-40 minutes to get elsewhere via the bus (my destinations rarely needed the tube). 

Food Recommendations:
*The Laughing Yak (Nepalese)
*Archie’s and Nora Cafe (Breakfast)
*Rhoda (Ethiopian) 
*Village Cafe (Middle Eastern) 

Day 0: $0. Landed at Heathrow, and took the Piccadilly Line to the Wellcome Collection ($0). Went here purposely because they had lockers to store my luggage before I could check on. Some cool exhibits here, not very crowded. Explored Central London, near Tower Bridge. Took in the cool architecture and London Bridge.

Day 1: $0. Sir John Soane’s Museum: Exceptionally neat; an amalgamation of antiquities displayed throughout the residence. 10/10 recommend.  Walked around Little Venice all the way to Notting Hill to go to the Portobello Market: Little Venice is overrated. I shopped on Sunday afternoon at Portobello Market and there were lots of handmade goods.  I spent several hours here and bought some pottery. This was a 25ish minute walk from Little Venice.  Stopped by Chinatown- big meh. Super crowded. Eat Asian cuisine elsewhere.  Saw Big Ben. Ended the evening at Westminster Abbey to see an organ recital- free, but sears could run out. Queue 30-40 minutes prior.  Didn’t want to pay for a ticket, but wanted to experience it (just was in Florence, so churched out). 

Day 2: Tower of London ($40). Interesting, and of course Crown Jewels were spectacular, however, could be missed. Very crowded, and I had a 9:30 am ticket. Don’t pay for the audio guide if you’re an English speaker, as there are more than enough descriptive placards. Imperial War Museum ($0).  I have always enjoyed visiting war museums abroad, as the perspective is obviously much different. WW I and WW II exhibits were excellent.  The Vaults ($0). Very cool graffiti and worth a walk through.  Shopping at charity shops near Brixton. If you like thrifting and have the luggage space, def recommend (wherever you are in London). 

Day 3: Buckingham Palace ($40). Ticket came with an audio guide, which IMO makes this tour more worthwhile than the ToL. Tate Modern ($0). A LOT. Worth a visit. Note several exhibits require a paid ticket. Borough Market- big meh. I don’t need to wait in line for food that I have to stand to eat in a massive crowd; lots of cool restos nearby. Kew Gardens ($12). Went after 16:00 for a reduced ticket. Felt more rushed than expected because the conservatories closed at 17:00. Don’t be like me, take a half day here as it a trek to get there.  I still really enjoyed it. Worth the visit. Got some great souvenirs here as well. 

Day 4: Tour of Highgate Cemetery ($23). This was the highlight of my trip. Opt for the tour over just admission (an extra $10ish). I learned so much about the cemetery and its history, as well as many “residents”. Plus the tour allows you to see the catacombs. Camden Market- again big meh. I wish someone told me this was just an outside mall; most stalls were selling stuff that looked like it was bought on SHEIN or Amazon; skip.  V & A- A LOT.  Some very cool exhibits, could easily spend hours here.  Farm Hall (play, $20). Never seen a play; interesting, but would not call it a “war-time thriller”. Turns out, maybe I am not a play person. 

Day 5: Spitalfields Market- smaller than Portobello Market, and more vintage/antiques (note, antiques are not daily, so check ahead). Worth a visit. No Amazon stuff here. Matinee showing of Hadestown ($37). Bought a ticket the night before, and so glad I did. INCREDIBLE. Music was awesome and the finale got me, even though we all know the ending. Caught a show at Village Underground ($37). Recommend if you like going to concerts.  

Day 6: Huge breakfast and made my way to the airport from the Whitechapel area (Elizabeth line, mid tier cost, Piccadilly line is cheaper, high tier is Heathrow Express). 

Regrets: Not booking free tickets to the Barbican Conservatory or Sky Garden. Did not realize that the BC needed to be booked (and not walk-in). Tried numerous times to get SG tickets, and never could. 

I hope this helps folks who are like-minded! ",2024-08-17 00:56:24
solotravel,1eufokw,not ready to leave vietnam,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eufokw/not_ready_to_leave_vietnam/,24,"I have been in vietnam for 2.5 weeks now and have about another week left before I was planning on leaving. However, I am considering skipping the 7-10 days I planned on spending in Cambodia and exploring more of Vietnam instead. (I would obviously go back there later but not right now) 

Just left Da Nang, came to Nha Trang (and wishing I didn’t). I’ll be here for 2 more nights so making the best of that. Then going to Da Lat for 2 nights and taking the bus to HCMC for 2-3 nights. 

I was thinking about flying back to Hanoi and staying in the north for another week. I have kind of skipped around a little bit because I did not realize I would love it here so much (more than Thailand). 

If you had another 7-10 days in Vietnam and wanted to explore more where would you go? Definitely trying to be in more nature/cultural places and stay outside as much as possible. I’ve been to Hanoi, Ha Giang, Tam Coc, Da Nang and now Nha Trang. Open to flying from HCMC and flights are fine because I have airline miles. Let me know any and all suggestions I can add on to my trip!!",2024-08-17 11:41:09

I'm thinking of going around Canada and America next year, sometime mid next year. So, I would like to get ideas from other travellers as to how to manage all the extra inventory.

solotravel,1eup853,Can I purchase travel insurance for the second half of a trip that I missed the start of?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1eup853/can_i_purchase_travel_insurance_for_the_second/,3,"I am currently quarantining after a positive covid test and am missing my departing flight for a multi country EU trip.

I am thinking about booking a new flight and housing (single bed room) for the second half of my trip so I don't miss the entire thing, but after this experience, I am weary of putting money down on new accommodations.

  
With this in mind, am I allowed to purchase travel insurance for this ""new trip"" in case my symptoms worsen and I need to quarantine longer? Or would that likely be not allowed considering I am quarantining already? Would I have to exclude any trip purchases I made before the insurance from my policy? (return flight, event tickets, etc)

  
Obviously I know policy is different with different companies but I am a noob when it comes to these things so looking for any experience/guidance I can get here.",2024-08-17 19:01:20
solotravel,1ettjkl,Feeling so lost after 7 months abroad ,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ettjkl/feeling_so_lost_after_7_months_abroad/,69,"I just got back to Canada after my solo trip to Thailand, Indonesia and a tiny bit in Germany. There were many days while traveling where I felt lonely and my mental health was struggling. A lot of the people I met were shorter term connections which can be hard to build stronger relationships. I often missed my friends and family back home.

Now that I’m back, I feel so lost. While it’s been great visiting loved ones, I don’t have my condo as I sold it before I left. I had quit my job before I left. And I just feel so much discomfort when I thought I would feel more relief being here. 

Now I’m thinking that I do want to get back out there again, to the ocean which brought me so much joy. But I fear I will just continue to go through this cycle of never truly feeling “at home” again. 

I’m sure there’s others who have had similar experiences or feelings.. hoping people can chime in and provide any tips on how to deal.",2024-08-16 16:39:22
solotravel,1euo5e3,"Advice on Solo travelling in SEA, China and Mongolia. 19M",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1euo5e3/advice_on_solo_travelling_in_sea_china_and/,7,"By the time I travel in 2025, I'll be 19. For the trip, I am to be in SEA around 2 months, China 1 month and Mongolia 2 1/2 weeks. For this, I aim to have a budget of around 8000 GBP for the total trip. The itinerary is for myself to start in SEA (Thailand) and work my way through Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. For this I have no issue, as mates of mine have done this with no planning and ease.

I hear otherwise about Mongolia, and especially China.

Research I've done on China tends to lean to the idea that, to apply for a Visa, you must have your exact dates of your trip noted, accommodation receipts at the ready and a good grip of Mandarin to not feel 'isolated'.

For China, for people who have travelled solo, did you have to book your hotels in advance, like is said by others? Is there a sense of unwelcomeness? And can you do it on a budget - around 2000 GBP.

For Mongolia, the only thing I need to sort is the idea of a guide... is it best to sort it pre-travel or just simply meeting a local geezer there? Research kind of suggests either or, but for a less manufactured and more 'pure' tour is it best to hedge my bets and meet someone there?

Any advice or feedback will be greatly appreciated :)",2024-08-17 18:13:15
