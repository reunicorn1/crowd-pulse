Anxiety,1gd9nuu,Elections and Politics,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gd9nuu/elections_and_politics/,5,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/Anxiety  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. Here is a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

Anxiety,1gq8wxe,Anxiety caused by loneliness/isolation,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq8wxe/anxiety_caused_by_lonelinessisolation/,0,"Hey guys… so lately I’ve been increasingly aware of just how susceptible I am to isolation and loneliness, and the extent to which I’m like… right on the brink of pretty intense anxiety as a result of it.  

I just became particularly aware of it tonight; when my roommate was out until around 7pm and I was all alone while it was very windy and spooky.  I live at around 9000 feet altitude in Colorado, on about an acre and a half of land - so it’s fairly isolated and you don’t really see or hear the neighbors unless you try.  And we do have 5 cats up here which definitely helps, but when you’re all alone up here, it can feel VERY lonely.  

Now, I’ve been all alone here in the past plenty of times before in the last 4 years while I’ve lived here, but the big difference is that my mother passed away about 6 weeks ago of cancer, and she was…. Really important and special to me, and the person I called when I felt lonely or anxious who would always make me feel better.  So in the past when my roommate was gone, I could just call my mother - or even just text with her - and immediately feel way less alone, way less anxious, way less isolated.  Now she’s gone, and when the wind is howling and I’m all alone up here, I feel TRULY all alone, and a little scared.  And I don’t really have anyone I can turn to - at least nobody I know will always answer and always be there for me, and be kind and comforting.  

Anyway, I guess the good thing is that I’m mostly quite emotionally self-sufficient, and it’s rare I feel truly alone and distressed.  It just brightened me a bit how alone I felt; and how relieved I was when my roommate did come home.  ",2024-11-13 09:13:32

As you read the title. I'm just another 18 year old, scared and complaing over life.

(or what I've read so far. Also sorry for any terrible grammar mistakes, and my sentences just jumping all over the place. all of this is new to me. Sorry!)



I just can't gauge on what I feel anymore. My body feels like it's on autopilot, just getting up to do simple tasks, which then ultimately leads me going back to playing video games all day. I hate it. I hate myself because of it. 



I say I wanna do more, but all I do is mindlessly scroll on TikTok or whatever the latest dopamine rush. I just can't take it anymore. I hate having this heavy heart, I hate being such a burden to my parents. They work so hard for me and my brother's. and what do I have to show for it? Nothing... 
I try not to cry every day, but deep down this feeling of being utterly worthless is just what I bear. I want to be happy. I want to feel normal, and proud of myself. But I lack any self-worth.
It probably doesn't even help that own brothers don't talk to me. (At this point they aren't even brothers, more like roommates.) So any motivation from them is nada. 
Yet, I don't bother to ask for my parent's help. Why? Because I just end up crying like a pathetic loser. I hate being so emotionally weak in front of them. I'm no man. I just get overwhelmed so easily... Hell, I almost cried during my first interview at my first job. (The interview went pretty okay nonetheless, still haven't heard back tho.)



In high school, I've never been the outgoing type. Sit down, complete your work, and don't talk to other kids. That's all I was. Just the introverted silent kid. Sure, I had ""some"" friends back in middle school and ""some"" in high school, but of course I ruined it all. I don't have real irl friends anymore. I love my online friends, but it's just not the same. I just wanna connect with people my age. If it's online wise, I'm the loudest, goofiest player. I don't strike up convos, but when someone speaks to me with a microphone, I have no problem speaking with them as well. But irl? I'd rather teleport back to my room and scream in my pillow of how awkward I am. I know this needs to change, but I just can't bring myself to change.



Back to school, I used to be a bad kid. I'd always disturb the class, throw paper balls at friends, laugh loudly in class... but I did change my ways a bit. My years through middle school and high school, I've focused more on my schoolwork. I'd become a straight-A student for a couple of years. Some B's and C's here and there, but who cares?
I've also gotten some achievements like ""student excellence,"" but over time they feel like nothing but stupid paper to me now. 

I haven't gone to college or university. which just makes me feel more worthless because now I'll just work some soul-killing job for the rest of my life. 

I'd like to be financially stable or ""free"", I've read through most Reddit posts about that. But just reading through it all, knowing that I won't ever become financially stable, just makes me look stupid for even trying. Just reading through it all about stocks and 401k's is just so exhausting. I shouldn't be feeling this way, I shouldn't even be reading any of this stuff at all. I should be a normal 18 year old, enjoying life with friends. But I'm not. I just want to help my parents out. Spoil them from all the hard work they've done for me and my brothers.



But then again, I have no passion, no hobbies, and no connections with irl people. For crying out loud, all I do is play video games. Sometimes I boogie board at the beach, doodle and draw some digital art, make stupid gaming YouTube videos, and sometimes I work out. But is all of that gonna help pay the bills? I don't think so.

It also pisses me off seeing stupid TikTok videos of ""locking in"" and ""your parents aren't getting any younger."" I already feel terrible, you don't have to rub it in. (lol)

Honestly, I'm making myself feel MORE worthless by reading Reddit posts about kids with the same problem as I do. I know I'm not the center of the universe, everyone has their trauma and or suffering in their own ways. I know I'm just being hypocrite for even complaining here. Just complaining to get some little validations from strangers I don't know.



Yet here I am. Wasting my life, your time, and my time. I know I won't get any ""professional"" answers here, nor will this post ever help me in any way shape or form. I should just go seek a therapist, but I don't wanna be more of a burden to my parents... so speaking to online strangers it is :)

I never wanted to commit suicide or try cutting myself, just based on religious reasons. Either way, Why would I even do so anyway, that'll only make me more of a burden than I already am.

I just don't know what to do with my life. I just wanna go to bed and never wake up. I'd rather be in hell, so then maybe it'll take some stress off my parents shoulders.",2024-11-13 04:37:08

Anxiety,1gq7mtj,Feel incredibly anxious and scared I may have M.S.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq7mtj/feel_incredibly_anxious_and_scared_i_may_have_ms/,1,"18y M - father diagnosed with MS.

I’ve always had health anxiety, even as a kid. I remember thinking I had melanoma because I noticed a freckle that was slightly larger than the others, and I once convinced myself I had diabetes because I pee a lot. So, this isn’t new, but this time, it feels more serious and genuine.

I’m experiencing a wide variety of symptoms that may simply be due to anxiety or stress about possibly having MS. These symptoms include things like pins and needles in my hands or feet—especially if I have my feet up while watching TV for too long, or if I’m crouched for a while and then stand up. I also feel a prickly heat sensation when I’m warm, but only in certain situations. For example, it happens if I’m in a hot house or wearing clothes that make me too warm, but strangely, it doesn’t happen when I’m out in the sun.

My eyelids have also started to twitch and feel droopy. They don’t visibly twitch when I look in the mirror (at least not enough for me to visibly notice it), but I can definitely feel it. My friend mentioned about a month ago that her friend with MS (unrelated) has a bad eye twitch, and now, four weeks later, I’m experiencing it too—it’s been happening for a few days now. If I drink, it seems to go away, or maybe I just don’t notice it. It is very noticeable and distracting and I can't avoid the feeling without getting drunk, frankly.

In the past month or so, I’ve also woken up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty, and twice now, I haven’t been able to lift my limb. It felt like dead weight. After sitting for a moment, it sort of “woke up” and returned to normal. The first time, it was my hand (which I had been sleeping on), and the second time, it was my leg, which wasn’t being compressed by anything as I was lying on my back.

I also feel slight muscle twitching in my legs, mainly when I’m sitting. It’s random and frequent, I’ll suddenly feel the smallest twitch in my calf, quad, or hamstring. It isn't painful or long, just brief, common, twitches. Also recently, I had really bad hand twitching. If I made a flat palm, my ring and pinky fingers would twitch. It affected my left pinky the least, followed by my left ring finger, then my right pinky, and finally my right ring finger the most—essentially in line with how much I tend to fidget with each finger, as I used to flick my chapstick with them. This made perfect sense, so I stopped flicking about a week ago, and it has improved a lot. It’s not fully gone, but I’m pretty convinced that was the cause. I’ll give it more time, so I’m not too worried about the hand twitching.

The reason I mention all of this is that I’m not sure if I’m just bringing these symptoms on through stress or if they’re actually MS symptoms, made worse by the stress of thinking about it. I feel I am going down a deep spiral.. I’m afraid to see a doctor because of the long wait times for an MRI. I’d probably die of anxiety waiting. I don’t normally experience anxiety outside of health anxiety, but if I had to wait weeks or months to know if I have a life-altering disease, I don’t think I could handle it without becoming an alcoholic, lol. It does not help my father having MS increases my odds exponentially, and that makes me even more worried.

Any advice or reassurance? I’d appreciate anything. Thank you for reading my long, anxious rant.

Edit - Just to provide some more info, my left leg, above 7 inches above ankle to the side, keeps twitching and has been for about 5 minutes, a twitch per second, then pause, then come again. Unsure as to whether it has stopped or is gonna come back. The left eyelid has twitched a lot more in the past 20 minutes, and then stopped about 10 minutes ago. ",2024-11-13 07:33:26

Anxiety,1gqagkh,Persistent anxiety after 2c-b trip?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gqagkh/persistent_anxiety_after_2cb_trip/,0,"Last night I decided to trip on 2c-b. Took 20mg oral and waited. After 2hrs I snorted 10mg and then 10mg more about 30mins later. 

This was overdoing it a fair bit - previously I have taken 40mg oral and it hit just right, but this was with friends at a rave. This time i was alone at home.

I very quickly began tripping very hard (by my standard - I've dabbled with shrooms and acid but never HUGE doses). Crazy visuals and a bodyload like turbulence on a plane. 
I began to get quite anxious - heart rate elevated (not dangerously so) and a really tense and uncomfortable feeling in my chest. I had chill music on and tried taking deep breaths but it didn't really halp. 
Tried reading stuff on my phone to distract myself but this only worked for about 5mins at a time. 

Eventually I ended up chatting with some people on a discord server who thankfully kept me occupied and calmed my nerves a bit until the trip calmed down a bit. But it got to 6am (initial dose 10pm) and I was still anxious and tripping a fair bit, so I took 20mg diazepam and eventually fell asleep. 

What worries me is that I woke up today with that same anxiety present. Not quite as bad, but still a distinct weight in my chest and elevated heart rate. 
When I've previously had bad trips (on shrooms), I've usually managed to sleep much earlier amidst my terror, and woken up pretty much unscathed. But this time I toughed it out much longer and now I'm scared that I've done some kind of permenant mental damage. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Will this last, will I need to see a therapist?


TLDR: went overboard on 2cb, had bad trip, anxiety persists the next day, have I done lasting mental damage?",2024-11-13 11:06:43

However, after doing more research on the possible side effects I am now getting anxiety about taking Lexapro. The main one I’m worried about is the libido and sexual dysfunction side effects. As, I am also married, It’s making me think twice about starting the drug because I would not want my partner to feel like they are suffering because of my mental health. As, I assume sex is a big part of almost everyone’s life, I feel like it’s a big risk to take. I’ve been hearing stories of people experiencing PSSD and it’s making me worry about long-term side effects as well. I’ve read that some people even regret ever taking SSIR‘s because of this condition. Anyone have any personal experience? Any men out there with similar thoughts?

I am the only person here for my mum physically (we are immigrants) so i am trying my best to be strong in front of her and am only reassuring her and saying positive/uplifting things (she has health anxiety and all kinds of other fears) but i am shaking on the inside.She is my everything and my favourite person and just thinking of what she has to endure in the next days.. i am really really really scared. 

They are so many other things that make this time even more stressful and anxiety inducing and i am finding myself wishing to be in my home country where we would have had more support … of course i know how lucky we are to live in a country where healthcare is free and available and to be in a place with one of the best hospitals/doctors and thats reassuring of course but .. i just feel like i am all by myself.I would love to be at the hospital ALL the time but i also have to make sure i am at home at certain times to let in/let out my cat (he gets stressed otherwise and gets urinary blockages which could be deadly), have to do my work/studies and cover for mum at her work (super flexible but still have to travel and work for at least 5 hours) so i feel like i am going to let her down by not being there for her enough.I will go visit her every day but i just want to be able to have the option to be with her 24/7 so she could be less anxious (her english is also not the best so me being there is really important) 

So i fee like i am worrying about all these things on top of the fact that she is going to have a major heart surgery… How selfish am i … I just want to be strong enough for her and make her feel like there is nothing that we can’t endure together. It’s been a journey getting here.She had her TEE in April and was told there is severe leakage and she needs “emergency surgery hopefully in the next 3 months”.We were then referred to a surgeon in a different hospital that specialises in cardiac care and he was very pro open heart surgery without even seeing any of her tests and saying things like “minimal invasive is the same just a lesser scar but we mainly do it for younger people or people who are going to get married, because open heart is better” i was ????? because surely both surgeries have pros and cons but saying something like that was crazy.I didn’t knew better at the time but after thoroughly educating myself on the internet (lol) i knew that i wanted to at least know if my mum was  a  good candidate for minimal invasive. After a lot of tests and a lot of back and forth with his team we were finally told that the said surgeon actually only does open heart (we didn’t know that as he never said that) and after a lot (A LOT) of advocating for ourselves we were finally referred to a different surgeon who is head of the mitral valve minimal invasive department and he said that he is happy to take my mum as a patient and he thinks that she is a good fit for minimal invasive.Obviously she can still end up having open heart as he is not able to know 100% but here is to hoping.. At our appointment with him which was in late September he said his waitlist is usually 3-6 months but since my mum has had all her  tests done if there is a cancellations he will try to fit her in .. and here we are. She is going to the hospital today  (13.11) afternoon and her surgery is scheduled for tomorrow (14.11) morning.I have read so much material,so many stories,i have bought so many specifics pillows (as per a lot of redditors advices ily guys) but when it comes to it … i am mortified and feel completely unprepared  ",2024-11-13 10:48:51

Anxiety,1gq9v2f,Need assistance ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq9v2f/need_assistance/,0,"Dear All,

I’d like to share an issue I’ve been experiencing for the past year, hoping that someone may offer advice or support.

About a year ago, I started noticing an unusually high heart rate. Concerned, I visited the doctor, who ran a series of tests and confirmed that everything was normal, advising me not to worry. However, as the symptoms persisted, I returned to the doctor. After more comprehensive testing, including a heart ultrasound, everything once again came back clear. I was told that anxiety might be causing my elevated heart rate, and I was prescribed Concor 5mg, which I’ve been taking daily ever since.

Six months later, I began noticing new symptoms. I felt increasingly forgetful, cold sweats, frequently confused, and especially disoriented in crowded places like malls. It was as if I was in a constant state of brain fog. Concerned, I went back to the doctor. After more tests, which all came back normal, the doctor recommended that I try Ashwagandha.

While I was taking Ashwagandha, I noticed a gradual improvement. However, once I stopped, the symptoms began to return—although they weren’t as intense as before.

Now, a year has passed, and I’m still taking Concor (as without it, my heart rate spikes to 140-150 bpm). While I still experience occasional confusion, it’s not as severe as it was initially. I’ve also noticed some weight gain during this period.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights on how to manage these symptoms, as they have been taking a toll on my daily life and well-being. I am 34 years old, with a wife and child depending on me, and I’m the sole provider for my family. Any guidance or suggestions you can offer would mean a lot.

Thank you all very much.

Then I would try to reframe how I think about these things. But don't get stuck on something and ruminate, you can't intellectualize  everything, sometimes just feel. if you get stuck search outwards for help instead of inwards. You have to decide that no matter if things seem meaningless to you, a happy life is better than an unhappy one and you can do things that makes you or someone else happier, healthier, better off, that's meaning.



I mainly had social and the big one for me existential anxiety, fear of death etc. Ironically the existential one helped with my social one, the thought that being afraid of people as nothing compared to the existential one. The Social one was probably not as bad as many have it but I just exposed myself a lot, really made an effort to go out there, make friends and see it as a challenge or an adventure. I really tried not caring about what people think of me, as I can't control that and that it won't be the truth of who I am and just enjoy myself.



The existential one, the big one for me. First I knew that some days I would be very scared and other times I wouldn't even think about it, so I knew that it was I that created the fear, nothing is scary it's just our interpretation that creates the fear. A person could freak out underground with walls closing in on it, while a mole would love his cozy little den.



I would have these fears of dying of a heart attack while sleeping. Ironically what helped was thinking it's just as likely to die of a heart attack when awake, chance is actually lower when sleeping and I will wake up from it so i might as well sleep. I was scared that a comet striking me or a bullet flying would kill me. All these things are manifestations of fear of death and loss of control. Truth is that we are never in control and that we will die with 99.999999% (repeating of course) certainty. What we can control is how we feel about it and that is where my next tip helps.



**I adopted a we know nothing attitude.** That the universe and life and death is so complex that we can't begin to fathom it and then try to be excited by the unknown rather than scared of it. Imagine how boring it would be if you knew all ends(actually you can enjoy that too, like when I keep rewatching lord of the rings) it's the uncertainty that adds spice. And in that uncertainty wouldn't it be better to assume something positive than something negative? That we are here is truly something special and we can't know if we go to heaven after or that we're reborn, or whatever we haven't even thought of yet. 



**the way I see it we are all connected**, all living things are one, we are existence, so in that sense we are immortal. If you think about it the way life is laid out is pretty perfect, we all get our personal story to tell with highs and lows. In my opinion earth is heaven or hell, it's just a matter of perspective.

I do not mind at all and im very grateful for the life they gave me in my younger years. However, i keep getting anxious over money. I put around 70% of my salary in savings and i do not like to splurge on things and if i do find an expensive item that i do like, i think for weeks and maybe months. However lately, its getting worse where i really get anxious if my family asks for money. I know its wrong from my end, but i dont know how to get this feeling away. I keep thinking that im gonna end up with no money. I keep thinking that all of my colleagues that do not have to support others are living comfortably and buying what they want (i know its wrong to think this way- and i am happy for them truly!) its just i want to help my family but i get super anxious and think of the worst outcomes always. And because of this, i truly think i dont have as much as i should have with this amount of saving. When the financial issues first started, i was still living comfortable and wasnt as anxious and it just felt like my savings increased in comparison to now(i honestly dont know how to explain it)

Anxiety,1gq8d8l,"This is a big read, but I’m desperate, thank you in advance!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq8d8l/this_is_a_big_read_but_im_desperate_thank_you_in/,0,"Hi everyone,

TW!!: Suffocation/DV
First off I would just like to preface saying I know this will be a long read, and I know I can only receive accurate recommendations and absorb others experiences, however I truly feel at my wits end. Just for some background, I just turned 19, I have always had low iron/anemia issues, and I have a family history of hole in heart and murmur issues (heart in general) and I am a smoker, I just quit nicotine disposables but engage in 420 friendly activities often.

Over the past couple of years I have had some extremely scary instances passing out. The first time this happened was years ago, I am not aware of how long I was out, however during me passing out I had experienced a loss of bladder, which I know is usually uncommon. These symptoms came and went over years, with me only ever feeling “super super” dizzy once every 6 months (if that) and before this year only passing out/fainting a couple times after the original spell.

In the middle of January, I experienced suffocation and hypothermia at the hands of my ex partner. In late January/Early February I had a bit of a hardcore night partying (only 420 activities were engaged in, nothing else.) and passed out after going to school and then standing for about 30 minutes the next morning. About 2 months later, about a month after I had got free from my ex relationship, I had been standing around a fire with my family for about 20 minutes and passed out/got sick to my stomach.

As summer came I became VIOLENTLY ill. Dizzy every time I stand up, heart beat as fast as a race horse even when just laying in bed, chest pains, passing out and shaking, sweating x10 more than ever before, increased anxiety and worst of all extremeeee fatigue mixed with anxiety induced insomnia. Not going to bed until 2,3,4 am and not waking up until 12,1,2 pm. I have the feeling of impending doom and my chest caving in constantly. It’s the scariest feeling I have to live with. I have been to doctors, the ER, Urgent Care, and worked with a neurologist. I have experienced loss of sensation in my left side (eye and reflexes) and as of mid July my Iron test came back at a…get this. 4!!!!. I have tried a mix of vitamins, iron, magnesium, etc…, have switched diets and tried to decrease anxiety but, nothing helps.

I’ve been told I don’t have POTS, but I know how hard a diagnoses is to get, especially at my age. I have heart issues in my family history as mentioned, but after EKG’s and having my heart checked numerous times, I have never had any abnormalities, skips, or irregular beats. Im really hoping someone (even though I hope you haven’t lol at the same time) has experienced this so I can have some sort of feeling that I’m not letting myself get worse and worse if it’s something serious. Idk if I’m overlooking an issue that could be caused from the physical DV aspect or I’m completely overlooking an actual medical condition that I haven’t thought of :( I don’t want to give up and say it’s just stress and smoking.

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ANY HELP❤️❤️❤️",2024-11-13 08:29:04
Anxiety,1gq8c5e,Feeling lost about the purpose of life and anxiety my future,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq8c5e/feeling_lost_about_the_purpose_of_life_and/,1,"I am at a crossroads in life, on the outside i am doing  alright, but I feel lost especially when it comes to life and it's purpose for me. 

For some reason I'm worried about the long term, constant anxiety around the future. 
My job is fairly average, enough to live by but nothing extravagant and definitely not something I can afford a house or family on. 

What I think is the purpose of life keeps changing 

A few years ago if you had asked me,I would have said that my purpose in life was to see as much of the world as possible. But now I'm not so sure. There are a few places that I'd love to visit but I don't think it's as important for me as it used to be. 

My friends have all moved away for work or marriage. So the loneliness of adulthood is now hitting me. 

My parents are getting old and although they do not want me to worry about them, I have constant anxiety about their future after they retire. I think subconsciously the new purpose of my life is to take care of them when they are older and not working. I know they want me to be successful but deep down they would also want me to be around them. 

The same goes for relationships, I am not quite sure what I am looking for in a relationship, my preferences in a partner keep changing, so much so that I really don't trust myself in a relationship. More so after a heartbreak last year. Sometimes i'd like some outgoing or outdoorsy, other times someone nerdy and now someone calm and introverted. Even when it comes to physical characteristics I can't seem to have a specific type. 
I've examples around me of both amazing and awful relationships and that further confuses me. 

I've got two neighbors both of them retired divorcees. Seemingly doing nothing and it depresses me to see what could be a possible future for me. They live by themselves and I can't imagine how lonely it must be for them. 
This adds an urgency and anxiety to my search for a partner. 

My job is fairly simple and straightforward and I think it gives me too much time to overthink and constantly stress about things out of my control. I need to find hobbies that keep my mind occupied. 

I know I'm still young and have a few years left, but it's hard to function with no clear purpose or goal in mind. School and university offered structure and clear directions and there was always someone telling me what to do and I think since I've graduated the loss of that direction has affected me more so than others.

Anxiety,1gpzyh8,My SIBO Story,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpzyh8/my_sibo_story/,3,"I hope this article finds you well. 

For most of my life, I could eat anything without any issues. Dairy, gluten, alcohol, and processed sugar never bothered me, and I enjoyed everything without worrying about an upset stomach or brain fog.

In the summer of 2023 (when I was 25), I started experiencing wisdom tooth pain, leading me to schedule surgery. I underwent the procedure under anesthesia and recovered fairly quickly. My doctor prescribed *amoxicillin* and *extra-strength ibuprofen* for pain and swelling. The nurses advised me to take *amoxicillin* with Greek yogurt to protect my gut bacteria. At the time, I didn’t realize how essential that advice would be or just how vital a balanced gut microbiome truly is.

A week or two after surgery, I began experiencing random bouts of nausea. I didn’t think much of it initially, but by January 2024 (6+ months later), I was increasingly concerned about the recurring nausea. It was also my first encounter with extreme anxiety.

I hadn’t been to a doctor for a checkup in about five years and didn’t have a primary care physician nearby. Eventually, I went for a basic blood panel, which returned normal results, and was prescribed a probiotic. I began taking the probiotic and tried elimination diets, cutting out dairy and gluten, but neither provided lasting relief from the nausea and anxiety. My research into these symptoms, both online and through anecdotal stories, only added to my confusion. I quickly learned that, while Google and Reddit can be valuable resources, they can also provide a lot of misleading information. 

After not finding relief with initial medical advice, I continued researching and documenting my own findings. I decided to try *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Berberine*, which gradually yielded the best results. (As always, consult your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.) I also stopped strictly eliminating gluten and dairy, instead consuming them more moderately. During this time, I read about rising peanut allergies in children, attributed in part to a lack of early exposure. This made me reconsider extreme restriction and take a more balanced approach with my diet.

Progress was not immediate; it took months to see real improvement. But now, I can enjoy Kefir and dairy without stomach issues—so I must have been on the right track. I also experimented with the Seed probiotic, which has excellent reviews, and took Thorne’s Gut Health Test with the Microbiome Wipe. Out of all the tests and doctor visits, Thorne’s test provided the most comprehensive and beneficial insights. If you have similar symptoms and can afford this test, I recommend it.

For anyone struggling with gut issues and the accompanying anxiety, I understand how exhausting it can be. Here’s a list of supplements that I take now, which have helped me feel much better:

* Berberine
* Multivitamin
* B-Complex
* Vitamin D
* Magnesium and Ashwagandha (on alternating days)

I also highly recommend incorporating physical activity into your week. Running, lifting weights, or even outdoor work can help your body manage real stressors and release tension.

But most importantly, what got me through the darkest moments and my most anxious times was praying deeply, reading my Bible, practicing gratitude, and memorizing verses. One verse that comforted me profoundly was Psalm 23:4 (ESV): 

“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.”

Thank you for reading, and may you find relief and peace on your journey.",2024-11-13 00:23:04

Anxiety,1gq5ywg,BF’s crippling rumination cycles ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq5ywg/bfs_crippling_rumination_cycles/,2,"My boyfriend (26) has anxiety, is medicated and goes to therapy but still deals with extreme ruminating thoughts. It usually comes out more when we’re drinking. But it will be an interaction he wants to know was okay or a problem that occurred earlier in the day that went unresolved, and will continue to ask me the same questions over and over again. It will be very small things like “did your friend know I was joking about XYZ.” He’ll ask for reassurance but no matter my answer, he will continue to think about it and ask the same questions over and over again. 

How can I help him? Am I encouraging him to ruminate in a way by answering his questions? It’s been impacting us a lot where we can’t have a conversation without a ruminating thought jumping in ",2024-11-13 05:39:08
Anxiety,1gq1p7v,Anxiety while traveling abroad,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq1p7v/anxiety_while_traveling_abroad/,0,"So let’s start by rewinding to 12 years ago. I had a major heart surgery where they had to go in and replace a valve. It’s metal, so I constantly can hear it tick as my heart beats. This also means that anytime my heart beats differently, I can notice it because I can literally hear the difference. About a year after the surgery I began to have crazy high anxiety triggered by the heart ticks and an obsessive fear of having some sort of medical crisis with my heart. The never ending anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks where I would sometimes go to the hospital because I literally thought I was dying. 

In the last 5 years I have managed to get these panic attacks under control somewhat, but I still sometimes have them, for example right after a workout when my heart rate is really high. 

Fast forward to today, I am traveling outside the country for the first time and I just had a panic attack for an entirely different reason. It just struck me that I left the US with a very robust and established healthcare system, and I am in a country that has healthcare but I’m not sure if it is the same quality or even how easy it is to receive help if I need it. We were out seeing the sites this evening and I literally had to bail and come back to our AirBNB because I couldn’t stop thinking about that.

I don’t even know the point of this post but I just needed somewhere to share my fear hopefully with some people who might understand.  ",2024-11-13 01:46:39

Anxiety,1gq5hjc,The great anxiety makes its comeback ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq5hjc/the_great_anxiety_makes_its_comeback/,0,"So I (26F) have been diagnosed with anxiety for about 5 years now. To put myself into context Im an extremely rational person  that loves academic validation. 
I was treated with therapy for anxiety for about 2 years but I stopped my treatment 3 years ago when I moved to a different continent. I’m currently being paid to study something that I love and I have lots of projects coming up. And yet my great anxiety has comeback worse than ever. 
I struggle on planes, I hate being on a car, I’m going on crazy rabbit holes. For example the other day I had a cramp on my left arm and I immediately thought I was having a heart attack and I had to laid down to avoid fainting even though I knew I was being ridiculous. Lately I have starting to have extremely worrisome thoughts -like for example picturing myself dying on different ways including falling on front of the subway or maybe jumping ? I cannot tell what the thought is because my brain response is oh that’s stupid I don’t want to do that but the thought is there anyway. 
It wasn’t this bad at the beginning of the year but I decided to break up with my boyfriend because I was tired on being on a relationship and I just finished a super demanding project so I’m finding myself with a lot of time in my hands. 
I think this might be related to my birthday? (I can’t tell) It was two weeks ago and I have always hated my birthday. As I moved away from home I have lost contact with friends but I decided to cut ties with them because I felt they were not adding anything positive to my life. And for my birthday most of them forgot/said hb to me late. 
I also almost never leave my place. I have always loved being inside but I think I’m taking it to another level (?). I dated for a while but then I decided to ghost this very nice guy just because I didn’t had the energy to deal with dating someone seriously. 
I’m also a person used to be busy all the time with lots of deadlines and responsibilities so not having much to do at the present moment is a punishment. Another thing is that it’s getting dark at 4.20pm so a lot of the day is dark and I barely see the sun. But then again I have never been a fan of the sun. 
I’m going to start seeing a therapist (but where a live -Canada- the health system is known for its long waiting times) because I know that I’m not depressed I’m actually very excited for many projects (books, conferences, trips) but still it worries me the dark paths my brain takes on its own when I have nothing to focus on. There’s also history of depression/anxiety on my family.
I don’t know i just thought of sharing this here because sometimes it really helps to write things down or tell them to someone else so my brain can start processing the situation and find the rational course of action. 
anyway thanks for reading and comments are more than welcome",2024-11-13 05:09:58

It’s an up and down kinda thing some weeks I’m more paranoid and others I’m mostly fine. My parents don’t know about these thoughts. I know I’m just being paranoid and that my thoughts are very irrational, so I’ve never brought it up because it’s kinda embarrassing for me. However, they still scare me a lot because a part of me is still like “What if?” You know? I pray a good amount when I’m scared and in general and that does help, but it’s still very difficult to deal with and still very scary. Anyways, I was just wondering how to go about asking my parents if I could go to therapy or something. Should I tell them the reason or would it be ok to be vague and just say it’s because of anxiety? ",2024-11-13 01:22:10

I decided to learn Hindi since I am half Indian and I want to connect with that part of my family culture and history, but I have been unintentionally not receptive to the material. In other words, I am finding it extremely difficult to learn the language. 

I already feel like there is a lot of shame surrounding my identity in the fact that I do not feel ""indian enough"" (since I am not full Indian) per say, I do not have many indian friends, and I was raised as a primarily English speaker. I have always wanted to be surrounded by an Indian community and feel empowered that I am learning so many things rather than ashamed, but I always come back to feeling insecure. 

  
Anyway, its been about almost 3 months of the class. The professor is not very structured in her lesson plans and it is hard for me to follow along as someone that needs structure (ESPECIALLY IN A NEW LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE BARELY BEEN EXPOSED TO). And I was asked to read in front of the class today, and I am not good at reading Sanskrit and I started messing up and u know next thing I know I am panicking and I can't breathe and I am scared and flustered and like angry at myself and it just starts happening.

Anxiety,1gq15hb,Chronic dizziness that's ruining my life,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq15hb/chronic_dizziness_thats_ruining_my_life/,0,"I'm hoping some other GAD sufferers can help put my mind at ease because this last year has been hell in a handbasket with GAD, particularly health anxiety.

It all started in March of this year when I started getting shooting pains up through my skull at random times. It spiralled me into an episode of HA and during that time these weird random, very brief dizzy spells started. I had a head CT Angiogram in May and it was clear. After that I went on vacation and the dizzy spells went away for a few months. Fast forward to September and they have been back in full force. It's hard to explain, it's not really spinning vertigo, it's like someone grabs the room I'm in and shakes it back and forth repeatedly, very briefly. Its like very quick and brief zaps.

It is literally like someone pulls the floor out from under me at times. It seems to be exacerbated by being on uneven or flexible ground like a footbridge or second floor packed with people. Any little movement causes me to almost lose my balance for half a second. Isles at stores are bad, Looking at screens also gives me problems particularly at work. Other life events have happened too, like the end of a relationship and some work changes as well. I have been an anxious disaster for two months and am seeing a behavioural therapist starting on Thursday.

It literally feels like someone pulls the plug on my brain for half a second.

When I'm having these brief dizzy spells I feel derealized and disassociated. I feel like I'm on a boat just bobbing and swaying. I know that's the anxiety setting in and taking hold.

The thing is that it comes and goes, and it happens at completely random times. Saturday was a disaster, Sunday I felt normal & great, yesterday wasn't as great and today has been terrible. After the clear CT I'm having trouble getting into an ENT to rule anything else out, but I guess it's reassuring to know that this isn't anything serious or terribly life threatening. I just want it to go away.

The only time I feel somewhat normal is when I drink alcohol and clearly that's not a viable solution, or when I'm too busy to notice it, but due to that and the actual nature of the vertigo attacks I'm inclined to think it's purely psychological, as I have no additional symptoms other than that. It could also be PPPD.

When these attacks happen it raises my anxiety level even more. It's ruining my daily life. I can't sit at my desk looking at my computer for longer than 20 minutes before I have to get up and walk around and that's not sustainable for my type of work.

Any anxiety sufferers dealing with the same thing and have some tips and tricks that helped you?",2024-11-13 01:19:38

My brother and I drove down here together and i was a nervous wreck the whole time (we left way too late and i get way more carsick at night). I’m leaving tomorrow around 1-2pm and for some reason even though I know we won’t be here long, i’m just riddled with anxiety.

I currently can’t fall asleep because i’m just so amped up from having non-stop anxiety for half the drive here, yet also exhausted, but I know if I fall asleep too soon i’ll just wake myself up again with panic, so I need to just calm down before I try to sleep.

I (18F) have been in 3 relationships before. Two with men, one with a woman. Every. Single. Relationship. I would be so anxious to see them, but I would enjoy my time with them. Like during each relationship there was at least once before hanging out that I would throw up. My family members can attest to that. It ruined my last relationship, I couldn't be around him and not be anxious. He just made me anxious. He was also a drunk driver so I promptly ended things (mind you, he was my age) and I can't tell if the anxiety was a gut feeling or something else. 

But for some reason, and now I'm in college, whenever a guy wants to see me somewhere, I pretend I don't see the text. As interested in them as I may be, I get so scared of nothing! I get scared that I will be scared in front of them, I think. Like I don't want to be anxious in front of someone, what if I puke? That'd be so embarrassing, I just choose to not go outside or see anyone because of that. This sucks. Has anyone else felt this way ever like even remotely",2024-11-13 04:59:06
Anxiety,1gq58x8,Anxiety triggered by long distance marriage. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gq58x8/anxiety_triggered_by_long_distance_marriage/,0,"So, I have been married for 19 months, we never had the chance to live like a normal married couple because we've been living in two different countries. He's in the US and all this time we've been waiting for my visa proceedings. 
He visits every 4 months so it's not bad but I just feel like I can't stand this life anymore. We are a happy couple, we truly love each other, we fight like normal married people but never over something major (a deal breaker).
But lately this has changed. The slightest bickering turns into a big fight, and I am always feeling like I need assurances from him that he still loves me. We fight almost every day now and I am starting to feel that he's getting bored of my anxiety and sensitivity to every word he utters even when he means no insult. 
There's nothing we can do but my anxiety is shooting through the roof. I have become extremely sensitive to every word he says. I always seem to be searching for insults in his words, I don't know why but I have never been like this, and this change in my own character makes me hate myself. I keep telling myself that he's a human being with a threshold, and I shouldn't push him past it, but I am too tired, too anxious to let go. He wants me to stop thinking about the process and just live my life until it is sorted out. I have been obsessing over it that I ruined our last vacation together when he was visiting, and now he is triggered whenever I want to discuss this because we both know there's nothing to do beyond what's already been done and all we have to do is wait and be patient. Unfortunately for me, I can't do that. These months were full of sleepless nights and migraines and what not. 
It could be the distance, it could be the time difference since I am 8 hours ahead of him so our moods aren't always aligned, I don't know what it is but sometimes I wish I could slip into a coma until this whole mess is sorted out, I am too tired and I don't know how to overcome the wait and all the possible bad scenarios that occasionally cross my mind. And more importantly, with every fight I feel like I am ruining something within my marriage to the man I love. I don't know where that leaves me but one thing I know is that at this point I believe that I am exhausted beyond repair.",2024-11-13 04:56:02

I know we’ve all experienced school life when we had those monthly drills at school which were one of the three- lockdown/active shooter, extreme weather, and fire drills. Long story short, I am deathly afraid of the fire alarm. I’ve got ADHD and anxiety and it’s always been a thing for me to loathe them. Not sure why. It’s not the drill themselves that scare me but the alarm. The flashing lights, the noise… ugh.

As I’ve transitioned into high school, my fear has lessened slightly, but only because my high school is the only school that actually announces the drill minutes before they do it so you get a little heads up. I’ve figured out ways to avoid it. I’ve emailed the teacher to ask if I could step outside, I haven’t gotten a no yet, but it’s really embarrassing to do that because then they think you’re weird and you’ve gotta live with that for a year.

I’ve got a fire drill tomorrow and I don’t know what to do. I’ve already played the “Can I go to
the bathroom” card twice, and this time, I can’t pull that. The teacher is gonna know what’s up.

WHAT DO I DOOOO????

-high blood pressure
-blurred vision
-light headness

-fast heart beat all the time (over 110 sitting watching TV)
-nausea
-GI track problems

These days its unbearable. I am so tired I can't do anything, can't focus and can't accomplish anything. 

Everytimes I went to the doctor, with barelt any tests, I was told it was anxiety. I was given random shitty useless meds that all had terrible side effects and no main effects.

Tried: citalopram, wellbutrin, abilify, seroquel, tadozone, and other shits I am sure I forget. All made me feel like shit and took months to get off. 

Recently pushed my doctors for a huge checkup. Everything is normal. Blood sugar, blood tests, all is normal. So, I was told again that it is anxiety. 


So how do you cure an anxiety that happens when you are not anxious? When you have nothing to worry and have absolutely no fucking clue as to why you are anxious?  My life is going great, the best it has been. And the symptoms are now pushing me in a depression.

I am so tired and my symptoms are so extreme now, I can barely work and accomplish anything. 

And also, are there any meds that are not stupid bullshit or make you tired like hell? As I am trying to cure my tiredness?

There’s a kind of lack of depth in my sensory experiences. But when I’m on marijuana, I notice everything more intensely. I can really savor flavors, focus on tasks, and feel present. I’m curious why there’s such a big difference and if it’s something about my mindset, anxiety, or maybe even ADHD. I’m wondering what I can do about it.

I keep battling mentally that marijuana is bad for me I can’t deny that it makes my life objectively better. Could this be more of an anxiety symptom than ADHD? Also do you feel that you medication increases your anxiety?",2024-11-13 00:02:21
Anxiety,1gpzgwn,Anxiety or health worry? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpzgwn/anxiety_or_health_worry/,1,"I’m a fairly anxious guy, but have never really had a panic attack or anxiety attack. But one day driving home, my chest randomly began to hurt. I began to panic, and as I panicked it hurt more. I got a burning sensation, went light headed, had to pull over multiple times. 

I was convinced I was going to have a heart attack. I went into the hospital and then checked my bloods and did EKG monitoring. They said it was all clear and sent me off. I felt a lot better. 

But during the following week, my left chest has continued to play up, randomly aching and then I get super anxious and it gets worse. I try to tell myself it’s all fine, but what if the nurses missed something? or what if something else is going on? 

Is this normal for anxiety though? for my chest near my heart to randomly get hot or ache? or is it likely a health issue? I’m going to the doctors tomorrow, just wanted some opinions. Thanks ",2024-11-13 00:00:30

I’ve struggled with severe anxiety for almost my whole life. After many meds I got on lexapro & wellbutrin combo at 18, it changed my life. 
I’m 24 now; I’ve had a baby and got married. I have an amazing husband, amazing kids, amazing life. 
My husband has a son from a previous relationship and his sons mom has single-handedly made it her mission to destroy us. I don’t doubt she has some severe untreated/undiagnosed mental health issues. I’ve never met someone like this in my life. 
Up until probably 2 months ago, I think I was doing a pretty good job coping with it. But things have fallen apart. She’s once again taking us back to court and my anxiety is absolutely controlling my life. Nearly every waking minute is spend in anxiety. 
I have no contact with her, I’m trying so hard to distance myself but I feel this constant need to control situations. 
I had a complete breakdown today because it hit me that I am absolutely miserable and I feel far too deep into this anxiety pattern to climb out. It’s my daily routine, anxiety. I don’t know who I am or what to do without anxiety. 
I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t settle for this anymore. I don’t even know how to begin climbing out of this hole. 
I’m in weekly therapy, i messaged my doctor today to discuss a med change. 

Therapy is giving me some good coping mechanisms but I am really struggling to even find the mental strength to follow through.

Please don’t tell me the answer is leaving my husband. He’s a phenomenal man. I need to learn to cope with my anxiety instead of running from it. I’ve spent my whole life running from anything that made me anxious. 

Any advice, recommendations or even support would really help me right now. ",2024-11-13 03:29:36

I feel like I'm starting to lose my ability to tell what's real and what's paranoia. I also feel weird whenever I go outside too, like all the trees are fake and everything feels like Disneyland or the matrix or idk.

I take meds (bupropion) which really helped me a lot until the last couple of months where election anxiety and then the job loss plus my partner's constantly having issues at their job that I'm trying to be supportive of and I just feel like I'm cracking...i have a therapist too but she's been unavailable the last two weeks. 

I have adhd too and am always forgetful but it's been like forgetting entire conversations and really basic things bad.

Today I went through all my social media and unfollowed a lot of people and groups because a lot of it is fueled by social media. I am going to be more careful with other media I watch too because stuff gets stuck in my head and feels like it's going to happen to me or the world.

This is more of a rant/open to contribution and discussion but I need somewhere to vent this and I feel there are many people in here who may have had similar experiences and hopefully be comforted that they aren’t alone. (Sorry mods if this isn’t allowed)

I’m 22 and have struggled with anxiety since I was 18 (I’ve always been subject to it but 18 was when it started intensely). I had a MAJOR panic attack, I thought I was having a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. They misdiagnosed me with a heart condition and for a month straight I felt sick and dizzy. They did more tests and finally said that they misdiagnosed and that they no longer believed I had a heart problem and that it was actually intense anxiety. 

From this I’ve developed serious health anxiety where I constantly feel like I’m somehow going to die. Chest pain? Lung cancer. Stomach cramp? Heart related issues. Headache? Brain tumour. You get the idea. But I’m left in a constant state of what feels like wooziness, nausea. This in itself makes me doubt the anxiety itself and makes me worried that perhaps the doctors did miss something and I’m actually in the early stages of heart failure or lung disease. (Even though I’ve been back and forth to the doctors multiple times to have bloods taken etc all with them coming back clear. 

After my first panic attack and false diagnosis I went T total on everything. No more coffee. No more cigarettes. No more alcohol. No more 🌿. I started vaping just for something but vape on the lowest nicotine quantity.

Despite all this, the worst of it all is the physical symptoms. Most occur even when im not consciously anxious or having a panic attack. The shortness of breath, the air hunger, the dizziness, the dissociation, the nausea, the overall gloom and feeling on edge. This all make health anxiety worse because I worry these symptoms are actually a serious illness. I wish I could just vape and not think my lungs will fall out and collapse or that I’ll die of a heart attack etc.

I just wish I could enjoy life and stop thinking I’ll die at every turn. It’s absolutely exhausting.

I tried CBT and therapy and I’m thinking of going back now.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? How did you cope? Did you take any steps to seek help and how so?

TL;DR
Intense health anxiety is exhausting. Physical symptoms of anxiety make me feel that they aren’t anxiety and it’s a serious Illness. I cut all vices out my life and now only vape low nicotine percentage and wish I could just enjoy it without feeling like I’m going to die. Any shared experience or advice much appreciated

I have a really hard time understanding my emotions and even feeling them at times so when the fear like this is stronger than others I can't identify, I get even more anxious, and all I want to do is sleep or sit around until I figure it out

I also have a 22 month old running around and just being your average toddler, i was scared of blowing up on her for just being a kid or worse.

I had been on Citalopram when I was younger which caused me to attempt twice and ended up in a mental institution for 2 months. They put me on Prozac and I stopped taking that when I got out due to how bad the side effects were. I had finally gotten on 0.25 mg alprazolam and i felt like a normal person especially with big tests and things at school. I loved that i could take it when i truly needed it rather than daily. 

I understand doctors are extremely hesitant on prescribing alprazolam. I understand people have abused it but I have 6 train conductors screaming from nearly colliding with eachother as thoughts. I have anxiety leaving the house, it's like I walk outside and a plane crashes on my yard. I freak out with my house not being clean but everyone says it is clean but it's not clean enough for me.

Anxiety,1gpq3x6,Anxiety Help Tips,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpq3x6/anxiety_help_tips/,1,"Hello lovely people! I’m new to this subreddit but not new to anxiety. Scrolling through some posts, I see a lot of people asking for help, like, how did you stop it? What do you do when you’re in the middle of an attack? Will this ever end? Questions I asked myself for so long. YEARS of suffering with my own anxiety, here are things that I’ve learned. 

*Making it clear, I’m not a doctor and not prescribing. This is for people dealing with anxiety when all tests and doctors tell them they are fine but are still feeling symptoms. And always check with your doctor first!

You need to find the cause. 

Is it: 

Mental health? Worry, stress, depression, etc… 
Physical health? Chronic pain, autoimmune, hormones, food intolerance, GERD or hiatal hernia, etc… 
Lifestyle: Job, family, friends, society, expectations, busyness, etc… 
Is it a fear or phobia like stage fright or social anxiety… 
Unknown

Sometimes these things keep us in cycles. I’m in pain and it’s giving me anxiety, which is giving me more anxiety and keeping me in pain…. We need to break the cycle by treating the root of the problem. 

Check your medicines and supplements. Do an elimination diet, even if that means giving up the main triggers to start (chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, food dyes, sugar). Then move onto bigger changes like gluten free or FODMAP diet if you have to. Check for Candida and try that diet. Look into drinking ACV if you have GERD, especially if meds aren’t helping. 

Drink water!!!! 

If you tend to have anxiety at night, if it wakes you up, if you have SVTs (palpitations and tachycardia), drink a little water before you go to sleep. Eat potassium and magnesium rich foods (if you don’t have kidney stone issues). Take epsom salt baths. Drink calming tea. Start a night routine that is comforting. 

If you’re a biological female over 30, check to see if you’re in perimenopause. It can come on fast and last for YEARS and some doctors won’t check hormone levels if they think you’re too young. There are natural treatments and home remedies to help but the symptom list is LONG and causes all kinds of anxiety and palpitations. 

Also, get your thyroid checked. 

Exercise, even if all you can do is stretch or chair yoga. Just try moving!  

Belly breathing is very helpful. When we’re having anxiety, we tend to chest breathe, which is shallow and not healthy. You don’t need to do box breathing unless it helps (didn’t help me) just normal breathing but be aware of it. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest and feel where it’s coming from.  This is a huge one for me and has helped so much. 

Stimulate the vagus nerve. If you are having palpitations or tachycardia, bear down and cough. Hum/ Sing. Gargle or gag. 

Learn about EFT (tapping). Add that to your daily routine or when you start feeling something coming on. 

Live in the present! 

Practice intentional living. Create rituals. Do things that you enjoy. Try a hobby. Learn something new. Go outside and be in nature. Focus on others. Volunteer. 

Are you introverted or extroverted? Sometimes we need our comfort zone, other times we need to get out there. Figure out what helps you. Does canceling plans and staying home relieve everything? Find ways to live a more simple/slow living lifestyle. Be a homebody if it helps. Focus on doing good in your space. Does sitting at home make you restless and cause more internalized issues? Go out! Burn off that energy. Have fun! Do what you need to take your mind off it. 

Positive affirmations/mantras. Say them out loud. Talk about your goals and what you want in life. Talk about your anxiety and tell it to stop. Anytime you feel a hint of it, say NO out loud and redirect with affirmations. 

Train your anxiety like you would an animal. If a puppy is sniffing around to eliminate, you have to redirect it outside and after a while, it learns to go to the door. If you have a kitten and it starts biting your hands during petting, you have to say no or make a noise to startle it and then redirect with a toy so it knows hands are not toys. You have to tell your annxiety out loud what you want from it and physically take action to remedy the situation. 

Read about Neuroplasticity and forming new pathways by redirecting. They use these types of therapies with neuro diseases but also helpful with anxiety. 

Look at the difference between mind and brain. 

Read about the Reticular Activating System of the brain and how it focuses on what you’re thinking about. Decide you want a yellow car and now all you see are yellow cars. It’s your manifesting area. What you focus on, is what you see/feel. Focus on anxiety and you will feel symptoms, especially first thing in the morning when it controls/regulates the sleep to wakefulness transition. Make sure your first thoughts are positive. 

Sometimes we need to put more of a logic, scientific approach on things and less of an emotional one. Don’t ruminate over false scenarios. Have you had all the tests and they are fine? Trust it. Trust your own body. Don’t let your mind send the wrong messages and throw it into chaos. 

Remind yourself, the main cause of heart attacks is from coronary artery disease, NOT anxiety. Unless your cardiologist said you have a form of CAD, you *probably aren’t having a heart attack. Heart attacks on average don’t typically last hours, days, weeks, years… give yourself a time limit and then let it go. If after say, 90 mins, you haven’t had a heart attack, tell yourself you will be fine. In those 90 mins, if you can do something to distract yourself until the timer goes off, that is helpful. They say most of the time you WILL KNOW you’re having a heart attack or you won’t know because you’ll be unconscious or dead. You’re not dead. You’re just playing bad false scenarios of what COULD happen even though it most likely won’t. That is not a way to live. *I’m not a doctor, this is just what my docs have said and what I have researched

If you’re at a higher risk with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, etc… get healthy. Stress and inflammation can definitely cause issues and possible long term problems. These things don’t get better unless you take action! Start by making healthier choices. 

Sorry this is so long but I could write a book on this. There’s a lot to unpack with anxiety, as we all know. Everyone has different root causes and ways to redirect. Anxiety treatment is not a one size fits all, unfortunately. But hopefully, we can learn and try and adjust to our own needs. Be well everyone! You got this!!

for years i've had this thing where if the slightest thing isn't right and or normal, i fear that something is really wrong. like if theres not as many cars on the road as there normally is. or if someone doesn't do something in character, an example being maybe my mother doesn't brew her tea as she normally would do every morning one day. or if i go into a building and some lights that are never on, are on. 

i just get this fear that something really bad will happen. like worlds blowing up and we're dying kind of bad. i've kept it to myself for years, i figured everybody probably thought like that. but recently after saying it out loud to my boyfriend i am realizing that this might not be usual. 

does anybody know why this would be happening? ",2024-11-12 15:13:16

He doesn't seem concerned but I am just because the 10mg (IR not ER) would take me from 120s to 70s-80s, didnt realy affect my bp though. The rest of my cardiac workup has been completely normal this is just some weird thing that keeps happening to me. I would like to add that I constantly feel shaky even if you can't see it, like full body shaky, which does not go away even after taking the propanolol, and have terrible acid reflux lately I can't get under control (working with GI on it) and I can't even drive myself around to get to work or I have this awful panic attack part way in with high hr and feel like im gonna pass out, it'll leave me shaking so much worse than usual for hours and hours after the fact, my prn xanax has not helped with those attacks (although it always helped my regular anxiety before).

I have sleep anxiety when I am not sleeping in my own room or in the proper condition (dark, completely quiet)

In the past, I've had little to no problem with this by overcoming it using ear-plugs or putting a jacket over my ear. But now, it's my own head that's causing the issue. I start hearing my heartbeat louder and my breathing gets shallow and I notice it, causing it harder for me to breathe. Some anxiety thoughts stem from, ""what if they start snoring and I can't sleep"", ""what if I can't sleep"", ""What if i dont have energy for tomorrow?""

Recently, I went on a trip with my bestfriends, super comfortable with them. But I found myself unable to sleep because of how i was so afraid I can't sleep. I cried and cried and I ended up surviving a 5 days trip with 7 hours of sleep and came back almost dead.

I am about to go on a trip with another group of friends, but I am not super close to the roommate I am sleeping with. I am worried of how I won't be able to sleep around her.

I feel like it’s so much more of a depression med, but anything to get rid of the panic attacks I’ll be open to.

The psychiatrist gave me 10mg to start with. He also gave me 4 klonopin to take “once per week” or as needed. I know these are habit forming as I used to be prescribed Ativan and they said the same thing about those. But truthfully I don’t feel anything from “benzos” unless I am in full panic mode, heart racing, teetering on going to the ER (in which case, they calm me down and get me to sleep) or if I’m getting on a plane. 

So - to hell with those lol. But will Prozac give me more of a long term, every day effect? I tried Effexor in the past and I absolutely hated it. Stopped taking it after 3 months because it made me feel crazy which just led to more anxiety.

There's only been one or two times where I didn't have a panic attack after taking an edible, so I'm wondering if there's something I can do to prevent it or if it was situational.

I was on my period and I ate it, sat on the couch watching baby reindeer, then suddenly my cramps started getting much much worse. They were deeper and more intense it was unbearable. Then I just got this panicked feeling and jumped up, running upstairs. I started feeling like I was blacking out and rushed to my dad saying ""Dad, I need to go to the doctor."" Very frantically. He was like ""Honey, you're fine. Those things cant hurt you."" And he just laughed and continued doing whatever he was doing. I collapsed onto the kitchen table and could barely move. My dad picked up my arm and dropped it back onto the table but I couldnt move it. I let my head swirl into the table, 100% convinced I was dying. After a minute I accepted my death, I was praying to die soon so that this would be over but I realized it was taking too long so I jumped up and started pacing around. I'd be in one spot then blink and I'd be in a completely different place. Like I was teleporting. I was trying to run around until my legs went jelly and I felt like I wasn't in a body.

My 11 yo daughter started high school, but has a lot of issues which are manifesting as severe stomach pains and anxiety attacks. 

We're at the stage where the stomach pains are being strongly pursued with paediatrician but all evidence appears to show that there's not much physically wrong. 

We know she struggles with anxiety, but it's just beginning to dawn on us how hard she's finding it, and how little we know how to help. 

Context:

She had recurring uti's when little and she developed severe anxiety about needing the toilet, and not having access (teachers are sometimes utter bastards about this because children with anxiety find it hard to speak up). 

She has since moved to a new city, a new school (which she just left to go to High school) and she's pretty lonely and struggling (she's not super academic, so hasn't quite found her footing yet). 

Currently:

Shes having more and more time off school for the stomach issue. We've had all sorts of scans and tests, but it's possible now that this may be entirely anxiety driven. 

It turns out tonight she voiced an opinion that she was scared that I (dad) would force her to go to school. 

My reply was simply that I love her, and I think school is the best place for her, but I am also trying everything I can to help her. 

She didn't like that all that much!

Any insight on this? Anything I definitely shouldnt do or definitely should?

Anxiety,1gpxan9,Anxiety at work- any suggestions?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpxan9/anxiety_at_work_any_suggestions/,0,"Hi all,

I (f25) have struggled with GAD for a vast majority of my life, with more severe flare ups in the past 5 years. 

I’ve worked in the NHS for 4 years now in 3 different posts and each time struggled with anxiety flare ups that haven’t always been dealt in the best way by management.

I have been in my current post for 6 months, it’s a specialism within a specialism, and I have done neither area before. My experienced senior colleague went on maternity leave 6 weeks into the job, and the person covering her maternity has also never done the specialism before. As you can imagine this has been very stressful and the team can be demanding at times. 

I have had a bad flare up recently of my anxiety, where I am stuck in freeze mode due to overwhelm and sometimes spend periods of time struggling to achieve anything.

I was honest with my work from the application and interview process, and throughout the job so far about my anxiety. I let my manager know that I am struggling to get work done because of my anxiety, I am still managing ward rounds and clinics, it’s more outpatient jobs outside of these that build up. 

Since then they have created a prioritisation list to try to help me. I understand the rationale but feel it has caused me more anxiety as my manager today asked what jobs were on there, when they were added, and when I was going to do them. My colleague is also now keeping a tally of who she has seen and who I have seen. Again I know this is a view to try to help, but I feel under the microscope and that if I’m not managing to keep up to speed I am failing. 

I have been working lots of extra hours over the past couple of weeks to try to get on top of things, and my anxiety has switched from freeze to high drive adrenaline. I feel more burnt out than ever. 

We did discuss potentially me not being in work, however sometimes time off can make me even more anxious and depressed. In my mind I am still turning up and doing something which is better than nothing, but now feel it is a lose-lose either way. I am so scared if I have another flare up, I will be in the same boat again.

Management ask me ‘what can we do to help’ but often I’m not sure. I have counselling (booking in extra sessions at present), I tried to get a prescription for some beta blockers, I have annual leave booked and plan nice things in with friends on the weekend to keep me sane. I take noise cancelling headphones into work to help ground and frequently use hot/cold and visual grounding techniques. I’m not really sure what to suggest but I feel the pressure to come up with a solution. 

Does anyone relate to this experience in the NHS/healthcare? 
Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?
Does anyone have anything that their boss/management has done to help? 

Anything would be really appreciated as I feel very lonely and again in a position where I feel like me and my anxiety are a problem for any workplace (which in turn makes me feel a bit hopeless).

Thanks all ❤️",2024-11-12 22:22:14

My partner and I have a somewhat open relationship, because of this, I am able to flirt with others, kiss, etc. (no hookups or anything like that though) When I do flirt with some people, I will be so obsessed with their perception of me. I share things about me that aren’t always true for everyone else because I want to be seen as “different”. I like for them to see me as some sort of dream girl. Does anyone else struggle with this?

Anxiety,1gprb9e,Health Anxiety or legitimate concern? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gprb9e/health_anxiety_or_legitimate_concern/,2,"So last week I (F,33) started to develop a bit of a cold. I got very tired and sleepy on Thursday, but Friday afternoon I did start to feel a little better again. I was traveling for a transatlantic business trip on Saturday morning. 

Saturday I woke up and could tell my heart rate was a bit elevated (around 90/100 bpm). I thought it was a bit weird but it continued on during my flight and the rest of the day. I was also very tired and started to develop insane anxiety. So bad, I even went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

They did some checks and didn’t think anything was wrong with me, and said it’s probably a virus causing my symptoms and to take it easy. 

It calmed me down a lot and felt better in the evening. I fell asleep hoping next day things would be better. They weren’t. 

The entire day I had really bad anxiety and panic attacks and still an elevated heart rate, pretty sure I was going to die. I also had extremely low energy and couldn’t walk a set of stairs without being out of breath. My panic gets so bad I call my mother who is a nurse and generally I rather not alarm with any symptoms while I’m away, but she was able to calm me down again and told me what I’m experiencing is a combination of stress, anxiety, a cold virus and jet lag. 

Again, I calm down from that and go to sleep, hoping next day things are better. 

Yesterday was extremely difficult but i survived and didn’t feel extremely anxious but was still aware of my symptoms. 

Today my anxiety is back again and I am pretty convinced something is wrong with me. I have back pain, tired legs, can’t walk stairs without being completely out of breath, elevated heart rate while sitting (around 90 bpm) and have some water retention in my fingers and feel thirsty. I also have very low appetite. According to doctor Google I might have myocarditis which is all I can think of right now. 

I really don’t know what to do because I kind of know I am fine and all these symptoms can be tracked back to stress , but keep tricking myself into thinking ‘I might not be fine’. 

Where to go from here? I really won’t be able to work until the end of the week feeling as miserable as I’m doing at the moment.

If I catch too much info, it will trigger me to think too much about it, and then I get a get tunnel vision and will pass out. I have to sit or lay down. I've been much better at stopping people before it gets too far. But it varies too on timing, it can be immediate, or I can keep it at bay for a few minutes.

Like talking anything related to vaccinations I can't do it, anything epipen or diabetic is like an instant trigger. But its not just needles, even talking about medication and symptoms for a tick bite someone else had has done it to me. Blood pressure talk has. And the other day it wasn't even a person, it was my cat and they had to take a bladder sample. They said too much and said they had to draw it with a needle and that was enough to make me to go flush, luckily I held off until they left the room but I needed to lay down after that to reset myself. 

I always was scared of shots growing up, which fueled my fear of the doctors office. Which is also funny because the dentist is fine unless they're numbing with a needle.

During Covid, I tried to exercise my fears a little more than usual thinking it may help normalize it, but I never improved and I actually think it made me more susceptible to being triggered.

It freaks me out because as I get older, I'm 30, well so do my parents and they don't live a super health lifestyle. There is no way I'd even be able to talk about anything health related, let alone manage anything for them because of this.",2024-11-12 21:56:39

After a short while I asked her about her annoyance and she said she's sick of walking on egg shells around me and thinks that I freak out and worry about everything too much and she's tired of it. Tbh she's not completely wrong, I have a lot of anxiety but I thought she was a safe person to talk to about it, I didn't realize how annoying I was being and never considered myself someone people have to tip toe around.

Thinking about it some more, I've come to realize just how dependent on her I am. I run all my worries by her looking for advice and her opinion means way more to me than it probably should. I don't really have friends to talk to about these things so she's my go to person. Although I still feel that she was a bit insensitive, I think she has a point that I should stop caring so deeply about her opinion of me.

i'm a 25 years old who never worked formally. i finished school in 2017, went straight to an two years technical course in chemistry and studied it the whole 2018. feel pretty sick in february of 2019, had to take a leave of absence and undergone surgery. spend the rest of the year recovering (most emotionally from the trauma of the pain i felt while waiting for my turn on the waiting list. coming from a family who always struggled financeraly, i was lucky the gouvernement paid for everything). did nothing related to the course, only spend my days taking care of my nieces for free and trying to be useful cleaning the house and etc.
2020 came and i was hopeful that i was going to finish strong and find a job in my area, but boy... how i was wrong . pandemic hitted in march, classes became online and i lost it. i so the whole time ans year so scare of getting sick or losing my parents that i frooze and never got into the classes. the whole year i distractes myself writing (wrote a damn 405k long bad story), it's the only thing who kept me sane. well, i was hoping to start freesh the next year even with the pandemic still going strong, but for my surprise the gouvernement call it a shot and proclamed that all students should be aproved and i ended up getting my degree after not studyng a shit the whole year. for those who studied it know how important pratical classes are to work on a lab. i learned NOTHING. but it was it. i has a degree. it fucked up my confidence and the impostor syndrome kick it in. i feel a impostor. i didn't feel apt ro work on my area. i felt lile shit. so in 2021 when the lockdown still was a thing, i didn't looked out for jobs. just writed and rotted in bed, deeling pretty guilty of myself. i was depreesed, but my mom and sister still tried to cheer me up saying that it was ok, because the pandemic was still around, that everyone was struggling but still everyone was going to their JOBS, they were being adults. it felt like i had no way out, bu then in july of 2022 my teacher called me and offered an internship for me at the lab of the School (the same i studied), i recused, but she insisted and i needed it to get my degree. here you have 5 years in total to complete the course and get 500 hours of internship (who is in some way a class), so it was my only chance to get it (my time was suposed to end in 2023). i ended up aceppting and it was the best decision ever. at first moth i was so scared ans anxious the whole time, but that woman was an angel. helped me so much with everything. explained things so patiently, corrected my mistakes, but gave me the freedom to learn things by myself. i watched a lot of pratices as an assistent and etc and ended up fulling that void the pandemic let in my learning. things seemed to coming in to place. i finished my one year contract and left (because it was voluntary so no payment). i thought inwas ready tp work but the fear came all back and i refused to believe it. everything seemed so fine. i have growth so much, but felt like i was back at stage one. i tried to push trought it ans focused on writing my final paper, who was basically me telling what u have learned in the internship and i presented it in the end of 2023. don't know how, but GREAT. i oficially took my degree in february of this year... nothing was on my way anymore but still... i frooze. i couldn't apply to any job out of TERIFYING FEAR. i shake, my head hurts, i cry just by thinking of it. i can't speak out about this to anyone because really who would understand. i have ""everything"", the most dificult part who was getting the degree, I DID IT  but how come a feel so unprepared? i feel so dumb. i feel so useless. i can't even let house at this point. i cry everyday but can't bring myself to change. i still live with my parents but only helps cleaning and with otherthings like going out with them to the doctor. still help my siste and everyone else the way i can but because i don't have  a job i feel like a failure. since i was a child i never had friends, never dated, never party, never got my driver license (i know i cant affoard a car), i'm so stiff socially. even in the internship i couldn't say hi yo anyone other than my teacher. i'm agonizing here. i feel like i may have some trauma because i feel stagned in my 15 years. i feel like time hasnt passes but it did. i can't afford a therapist right now and suicide seems like the only way out. i don't even care if i ended up being homrless, i guess i deserve it. it would feel better than keep wasting my parents money :/

edit: oh, i forgot to add. sometimes i help my sistter cleaning an church and we slip the money and last october (this year) i was able to work on the election doing promotion for an candidate. but still the church it's my sister who let me go because she needs help and the election it was my mom who got ir for me. my biggest problem is getting it on my own and going through the whole process of applying, doing the interview and finally getting the damn job and benefits. i don't have contacts ans my relatives doesn't work formally either. they do something here and there but it's so unstable and doesn't really count as experience in my CV. the unstability, it kills me and it requires me having to meet people so they talk about me to others ",2024-11-12 04:07:30

I’m just finding it really difficult at the moment to hold conversations due to my anxiety it’s been pretty hard recently mentally. I’ve had a really bad mental breakdown I just can’t seem to find my way back to getting myself back to the way I use to be. I want to be free again. 

I have this problem now where I always think people are talking bad things about me. I sometimes think I can hear what people are thinking by their facial expressions. Loads of strange things have been happening which I feel like no one understands if I tell them. So hopefully maybe someone on here will.

Can anyone help or suggest any ways how I can cope with the situation I am in I would appreciate this a lot. 
Thanks

Today, I feel like every little worry becomes a flood of fear. My whole body is tingling, my heart is beating a little too fast, I feel like my mind is both racing and frozen all at once.

Now since I'm out of hospital, it's just surged. I can't just relax. I can't not feel fear or worry.

I'm really unhappy about it and wish it would go away. I don't know whether to think it's gut related or not. I don't know whether it'll improve with meds, or how to even go about getting then in the UK without getting stuck waiting for months, if not years.

Anxiety,1gpua7j,"Seeking advices for medication with ADHD,TAG and depression. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpua7j/seeking_advices_for_medication_with_adhdtag_and/,0,"
Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community because I'm feeling quite lost and could really use some advice. I have been diagnosed with ADHD by neuropsychologists, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and depression. Currently, I'm taking Strattera and Zoloft, but I'm facing some significant challenges.

My Current Situation:
- Strattera: It helps a bit, mainly by reducing my urge to use drugs (I'm a recovering addict), but overall, its effects are minimal.
- Zoloft: Despite being on it for 4 months, it causes severe insomnia. Additionally, it triggers cravings for drugs, which I haven't experienced in a long time. I will likely need to stop taking it.

Challenges with Other Medications:
- Stimulants: While they help in the afternoon, they leave me feeling extremely depressed later on, so they aren't a viable option.
- Wellbutrin: My doctor advised against it due to its potential to worsen anxiety.

What I'm Looking For:
I need a medication that can help me manage my intense emotions and constant anxiety. I feel that if I were calmer, my ADHD symptoms might be more manageable. I've considered Buspirone, but I'm unsure if it's the right choice since I also need something for depression. My sadness feels chemical and without any apparent reason.

My Struggles:
- I feel like a lost cause and don't know what to do next.
- I need a medication that can help with both my anxiety and depression without causing severe side effects or cravings.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation? What medications or combinations have worked for you? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

No seizure medication seems to be working well and my mom thought that maybe getting on anxiety medication could help better. When I have seizures im usually stressed. The last seizures I had were a mini seizure at Old Navy when I was stressed about finding a halloween costume on time for a party, another mini one after I got done at my job at a coffee shop, and a full one before work one time. 

So seeing that they are usually from stress my mom suggested anxiety medication. 

  
Seizure medication seems to make my brain not work right. Im slow, im tired, I can’t remember things. What does anxiety medication do to you? 

  
My bfs mom suggested L-theanine but I’ve taken it before and it doesnt seem to do much. She also said something about ashwaganda and I’ve tried that but don’t remember how it was. Ive taken like 2.5mg of thc and that works in a way.…. ",2024-11-12 20:12:02

Today, I’m feeling this really weird chest tightness. There’s no pain at all. It just feels extremely tight at the sternum and I’m also feeling a burning sensation right below breastbone/center of the upper abdomen. It’s kind of affecting my breathing too even though i’m taking deep breaths. Idk something feels wrong today in general. My heart rate while sitting is also ranging between 90-120 even though I’m not doing anything. No pain elsewhere. Is this my anxiety? I haven’t had any thoughts today except for sharing some stuff with my therapist during our session.

So I deal with pretty debilitating anxiety these days, mainly sleep anxiety (intense anxiety about not sleeping). Anyway, I've been on sick leave for a month and a half now and my mental health has been very bad. Had to call a crisis center last week and ended up going to a mental hospital emergency room. The psychiatrist at the hospital took me off Wellbutrin which my family doctor had prescribed cause I'm pretty sure it made my anxiety much much worst and instead put me on Pregabalin (Lyrica) 50 mg, going up to a 100 mg after a week, once at night. For now I feel 0 effects and I still need to take benzos to get some sleep. I was on Ativan 1mg and resistance kicked in pretty quick and had to take 5mg some nights to counter the panic attacks. Anyway, my family doctor changed my benzo to Clonazepam 1mg but it's also not working, cross-resistance and all. I'm having CBT therapy once a week and I've been working on it at night and I feel like I'm able to reassure myself and keep the panic attacks at bay but there is always still this like constant anxiety that just won't go away no matter how much breathing exercises, meditation and CBT I do and I just won't fall asleep. Again last night, I had to take more than my prescription of Clonazepam and now I'm just scared my doctor will cut me off. Even my pharmacy when we changed acted like I was very sus, but like I'm not seeking a high, I just wanna sleep. People are telling me exercise it will release endorphines and shit but like ya sure, but the anxiety will still be there. I'm just at a loss and getting more and more down.

- fatigue
- slightly blurry vision
- literally feel the cortisol rush in my body

The Cause: 
I've been working 2 f/t jobs for over a year because I can't ""get ahead"" financially otherwise. I'm catching up on retirement because there's nothing there from my 20s.

I'm also nervous because both jobs have been firing or letting go of people, so in this economy especially, my mentality is ""hold both just in case"".

But F*CK IT IS KILLING ME. Had to call out on one of my jobs this week because I almost fainted in the grocery store.🙃 

The issue is, both jobs are ""great jobs"", but there's no obvious choice since both have been more demanding lately. There is no end in sight. 

Also -- I just moved in with the love of my life. So my expenses has increased (moved from a LCOL area to HCOL due to me being remote and my partner's job is in person). Which puts me financial pressure on keeping these 2 jobs. 

Idk what to do. I've been resting these last couple of days and it's not healing me lol

I feel like I'm going to break. Any practical advice?

I have been using medical red light therapy, but any vitamins I can take, etc?

For context, I (22F) grew up in a family where my parents simply suck. They gave birth to me solely for the reason of having someone to care for them when they get old. They have no parenting skills and terrible emotion control. Also they have always tried to manipulate me to do what they want, sometimes it's actually good for me but most of the time it's just straight up selfish stuff. I grew up and have always equipped myself with the belief that I should deal with my stuff by myself first, I should rely on myself and learn to love myself properly before loving anyone else. 

Being born to terrible parents also gave me depression and anxiety disorder, which I only got diagnosed 4 years ago when I moved out for uni. However, I didn't begin taking meds until 1 year ago, the reason being I barely had enough money to do loads of tests back then and also I wanted to find a trustworthy place(?) to redo the diagnosis and prescribe for me. A year ago I was recommended this mental clinic run by a quite well-known doctor in my area. I have been visiting this place every month since then. Every visit so far has been fine except for one, which is also the one that I have just had a few hours prior to writing this. The doctor asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said no and I wanted to focus on loving myself first. Then the doctor just kept shaking his head, saying the only way I can get out of this is to get close to other people, go on dates and have a bf. And I said ""while I understand that I should get outside and hang out more to let loose, it doesn't mean that I should simply have a relationship just for that reason. Having a bf or not doesn't change my depression because first thing first I have to learn to love myself"". And not even after I finished speaking, the doctor just straight up said nonononono, handed me the prescription, and shooed me out of his office. 

I went out of the clinic confused but I still had some homework to do so I temporarily forgot about what happened. But as soon as I was done, the thought of it emerged again, and I forgot what happened next but all of a sudden, I found it hard to breath and my tears kept flowing uncontrollably. Then my breath started to get heavier and heavier, my heartbeat went crazily, my body felt heavy and frozen, my muscles felt numb. I kept scratching myself, my head, my cheeks, my chest area. I rolled around on my bed try to find some way but I just couldn't stop whatever was going on. My brain felt empty and empty, and the strangest/scariest thing was that it was the first time the thought of jumping through the window just flashed through my mind WITH NO HESITATION. I just simply wanted to end all of that, and the idea of suicide just came naturally to me because nothing else worked. 

I forgot what happened in detail after that but after like less than 10 mins or so it kinda decreased and stopped. But then I thought about the strange events that had just occured to me and I felt my tears running down again. I decided to try to distract myself by googling what the thing happened to me could be, and the first thing I saw was panic attack. And I honestly don't know what even led me to this subreddit to write this post because I don't even write diaries. But I guess I would just leave this here as sort of a memo for myself for going through the most terrible day ever. 

Honestly speaking, I feel horrible right now. I regret letting this happen to me. Deep down in my heart, I'm deeply hurt, I thought he could have terrible opinions to himself, but he had no rights to disregard my opinions rudely like that, let alone such a sensitive topic to me. But the rational part of my mind is just going ""he is a terrible doctor, so more reason to forget about him, why am I bothered to shed tears for such thing?"" and this is making me regret even more. 

If you made it here, thank you so much for reading all this crap. I genuinely hope you'll find peace wherever you are on your journey 🫂

Anything medical is super scary to me and puts me into panic mode. I don't like going to any kind of check up like getting my eyes checked or a teeth cleaning because I am afraid that there is going to be something wrong with me. Thinking about getting my blood drawn brings me to tears because I am just so scared.

Anxiety,1gps6h1,Doc has given me 3 options for depression and anxiety ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gps6h1/doc_has_given_me_3_options_for_depression_and/,1,"30M suffering with low mood, anxiety, apathy, no enthusiasm about life with no cause. Had my bloods done and nothing underlying causing. 

I currently take 20mg citilopram and have done for 8 years. I no longer think it is working due to the symptoms which I am experiencing. My doctor has given me 3 options to think about and do my research on. I would appreciate any guidance on the below options:

Carry on 20mg citilopram and take hydroxizine. My doctor said hydroxizine can help SSRIs work better

Increase citilopram dose to 30mg and see how I feel but I’ve done this in the past and it has given me bad side effects. 

Try a different SSRI, sertraline is the one that was suggested and see how I get on with that

I am on the waiting list for therapy but I’ve had CBT before for anxiety and it worked at the time but doesn’t help my depression.

Funnily enough in the past I have taken gabapentin for nerve pain and this is actually the best I’ve ever felt mentally but my doctor said they can’t prescribe it for low mood or depression which is a shame. 

I am just looking for experiences on the above as I’m really not sure what to do and I’m at a cross roads and the doctor said it’s completely up to me. 

Thanks in advance. ",2024-11-12 18:50:20

Anxiety,1gplupu,Help me ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gplupu/help_me/,1,"
I’m 23 years old, talented, and building my career in my own way (in art). I come from a middle-class family, but that’s not the issue. The problem is that I don’t like my personality, and I feel a strong need to change it. For the past six years, I haven’t been in a relationship, and I keep feeling like something is wrong with me. People tell me I should improve my personality. While my friends say others are attracted to me because of my looks, they also point out that my personality is lacking.

I’ve been in three relationships so far, and none of the people I proposed to have ever turned me down. However, I feel like those relationships didn’t last because of deeper issues within me.

Recently, one of my friends told me that her friend had a crush on me. I was really happy to hear that, so I sent her a friend request, which she accepted. We started chatting, but after a while, she lost interest and stopped responding. Curious about what went wrong, I asked my friend to find out what she thought of me. Her response was, “He has the looks, but his personality isn’t enough.”

Another situation that bothers me is my social awkwardness. For example, if I’m in a room with five people, I can talk, laugh, and have fun. But when most of the group leaves, and I’m left with just one or two people, I suddenly become clueless about what to say or how to continue the conversation. I also have trouble talking to girls I meet unexpectedly; I freeze up and don’t know how to engage in a meaningful conversation. I don’t smoke or drink, and while I don’t think my personality is toxic, I feel like it’s just not strong enough to make a lasting impression.

A lot of my struggles come from issues in my past, especially family problems that have caused me emotional pain and left me feeling depressed. Even when I’m supposed to be enjoying happy moments, thoughts of my past come rushing in, stealing my joy. Because of this, I often have a sad expression on my face. Ever since I turned 18, it feels like I’ve forgotten what true happiness is.

Right now, more than anything, I really want a meaningful relationship in my life. I know people say that it’s not about looks, but about what you do and who you are. Deep down, I feel like looks don’t matter as much as people think. I just wish I could develop the kind of personality that makes people want to stay, not just be attracted to the surface.

Anxiety,1gpr68f,Unexplained fever. Afraid of leukemia,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpr68f/unexplained_fever_afraid_of_leukemia/,1,"Hello. 
23 F. Relatively healthy. I don't drink enough water at all ( around 300 mll per day plus one or 2 coffees). Diet is okay but some days I don't eat at all. 

My health anxiety has been horrific recently and everything I can think of is leukemia. 
It was actually good for few days but then 2 days ago I started experiencing fever (ranging 37.0 to 37.6) without any other symptoms. It's not getting more than that but it's not getting less either. 
I'm for sure not sick as I don't have any cold or flu symptoms. 
Of course my dumb head dugged into the leukemia Reddit and sure enough people were describing that exactly low grade fever is the first symptom of leukemia. I lost it at this point. I'm sitting in my bed unable to breath or function because of a panic attack. 
Recently I also feel tired and off but not the type of tired to not be able to move I still can walk all day be at uni and everything but the whole time I just feel down and sad and depressed. 
This also contributed to the leukemia fear as I know fatigue is a common symptom. 
I sleep around 7 hours per night sometimes less and I wake up usually at least 1,2 times per night. In February I had blood test that showed I was vitamin d deficient and i only took medications for like 5 days (dumb I know) but then in the summer my doctor told me it should be fine again as I was getting plenty of sunshine. 
I'm just so miserable right now. I'm thinking of going to the doctor but my House doctor is dismissing me every single time. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like I'm dying every day. 
Any advice. Can anxiety cause fever? Should I go to emergency?

Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post it so I apologize if it’s not. I just wanted to write something up and mention a little bit of what happened to me hoping maybe it could even help a couple of people. I will try to keep it short. 
For years I was dealing with IBS (mostly C but D also), anxiety and panic attacks to no end, OCD, depression, derealization/depersonalization, vertigo, hallucinations. had no answers, my  doctor said there was not much to do anymore. So I did loose hope a bit.  Anyway fast forward years, I have diagnosed with Mold/mycotoxins poisoning, and Lyme disease with co infection. These both can look like literally so many other things. I had over 25 symptoms that they told me was anxiety. Mold and Lyme can cause ocd, anxiety, depression, amongst many many physical symptoms I had like no appetite, constant nausea, numbness, vertigo, etc. I guess I just wanted to say, it could be worth looking into Mold, Lyme, MCAS. Any questions I would love to talk. I wish the best for everyone 
 
TLDR: if you have countless symptoms but in tests you’re “healthy” Mold poisoning, Lyme Disease, and MCAS worth looking into for IBS, Anxiety, OCD, Depression and literally any physical symptom under the sun. We deserve to be healthy, and we deserve to be heard, not given pills and just be pushed aside. Again please feel free to reach out",2024-11-12 17:23:08

I’ve been having worse anxiety than I’ve dealt with before and I’m looking for advice from those that understand it. 
I’m a teacher and have been under quite a bit of stress this year with a difficult class, new curriculums, and grade level. Last Friday I had sudden tightness in my chest and upper back followed by a panicked feeling. I took the day off and saw a doctor. She said everything seemed fine and it was a panic attack. She prescribed me Lexapro 5mg to start the next day. Over that weekend I had three other anxiety attacks and Sunday threw up all day. I took off again Monday and thought I was feeling calmer and less nauseous. Then this morning (Tuesday) I began to feel extremely anxious again before leaving for school. I was nervous I would have an attack in front of the kids and called out again. 

I talked with my assistant principal on the phone who was supportive and recommended I talk to my doctor about a two week leave or so to allow my new medication to begin working. I have lost of guilt about being out for two weeks. I feel like I’m being dramatic and should be able to handle the job I’ve done for the last 8 years. I am looking for other jobs and the stress of transitioning and being able to keep paying my bills is getting to me too. I know it’s important to take care of myself but what will I do for two weeks? And will it actually be better in two weeks? Any advice is welcome.

I remember that it was sensitive at first but I thought it was normal since ive had other teeth that has fillings and they felt sensitive at first too.
As time goes by it became discolored. Its not black but its kinda yellowish?? it’s different from my other teeth.
At first few years was nothing, but now I have some 2 gum boils located at my two upper front teeth. I cannot afford anything since im still a student.
Dental fees are so expensive and my family cannot also afford it thats why I just left it out since I dont feel any pain.

Ive developed allergic rhinitis and thought it has nothing to do with it since it runs in the family but now, i don’t know. Im very worried. 
Then 2 years ago I came to the doctor to change my fillings and she noticed that I cant feel anything on my impacted tooth (like it was numb) but she did not say anything about it and proceed to do the fillings so i thought it was gonna be okay. 😭


Am I gonna die?
Am I gonna be sick?
What are the consequences for waiting this long?

Im scared.",2024-11-12 16:44:14
Anxiety,1gpoyb4,For the first time I’m considering anxiety meds,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpoyb4/for_the_first_time_im_considering_anxiety_meds/,7,"
So I’ve had anxiety me entire life, as a kid (8-17) it used to affect me so much that I had stomach pain and severe insomnia. It all stemmed from living in an abusive household. Then that made me have a fearful avoidant attachment style, have relationships with bad people, fall into bad patterns, etc. 

So I’m 30 now and life has fallen together more positively since 2020, I live on my own, love my job, am graduating with a better degree in a couple weeks. With that said I ended a healthy long term relationship with a partner I lived with earlier this year, ended some long term friendships I felt weren’t compatible for me anymore, and now am in a situation where I was briefly dating someone who recently backed out because I expressed concern about something I had anxiety over and yeah… he deemed us incompatible (even though all I wanted was clarification). 

I’m feeling so low, like when is this going to end? Can I ever just be normal? I’m considering seeing someone to start medication because I’m tired of the constant relentless worrying cycles I get caught up in. I feel like it’s making me ruin good relationships with people.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD but often wonder if I have ADHD and Asperger’s.",2024-11-12 16:39:11
Anxiety,1gpoxc5,What do I do about this?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpoxc5/what_do_i_do_about_this/,0,"So I (18) am a university student in my first year. Unfortunately, my anxiety is so bad I can no longer function like a regular person. I live independently, but it's a struggle to do basic things like clean, eat, sleep, go to work and class etc. I have to forfeit some things to get others done. 

I've only been at uni for a couple of months but I've already missed my first (and only so far) deadline and still haven't submitted it because anxiety gets in the way. I'm seeking support in uni for disability (ASD) but my appointment is in December because I was struggling too much to make the appointments on time. I'm seeking support outside of uni for my mental health but it's a charity that can't prescribe meds (and also hasn't got back to me for weeks) because my GP wouldn't listen to me the last time I tried to go and I've tried every other charity in the area. I feel as if I'd really benefit from meds and the CBT I'll be offered just isn't enough (tried it before and it didn't help). I've recently lapsed into destructive behaviour and increased suicidal ideation, and even though I'm trying to stop it's in the back of my mind. I'd like to live a normal and happy life, but first and foremost I don't want to flunk out of uni. It's all I care about in my life. What can I do about this? ",2024-11-12 16:38:03

Anxiety,1gpghgh,Wellbutrin (my experience) for anxiety ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpghgh/wellbutrin_my_experience_for_anxiety/,3,"Long —

I’m making this post with the intentions it’ll reach at least 1 person to give them hope.


Let me start off by saying that I’ve struggled with anxiety for pretty much all my life, especially the past 2 years where it got unbearably worse. I have GAD. 


So,
I got misdiagnosed in HS with ADHD and was on and off stimulants (horrible experience if u have anxiety). I had a feeling that I didn’t have adhd but I kept telling myself maybe I do and need to give meds more time(on and off them for 3years lol). 


Took me months honestly to go finally talk to my doctor and speak up bc I was so anxious to go in (he wasn’t the one who misdiagnosed me. Anyways I told him I want a lower dose bc the anxiety is genuinely unbearable and I also can’t focus in uni.. so I need the meds and need help. We talked more about my anxiety and symptoms etc and he agreed I may have been misdiagnosed so he prescribed me antidepressants (Wellbutrin) for anxiety instead.


Let me just say I was so so scared to try the anxiety meds, as someone who is very scared of meds and used to be overly skeptical of them. when I did try it tho (I’m at a higher dose now) I truly felt so much better and a noticeable change!! Social anxiety, anxiety towards just anything just decreased!! Like it was easier to move past the feeling and the thoughts. And let me not forget intrusive thoughts, i rarely get them anymore!!!! It’s been almost a year now and i honestly wish i had spoken up earlier. I do have very bad anxiety but the medication make it so much easier to get through the day and push myself past things and show up more.


To anyone out there, it’s okay to reach out for help. Sooner is better than later and I promise it can get better, you need to reach for the help you need (while shaking in your boots) and find the right resources. You’re not alone!!!! You deserve the comfort in your skin and mind. Things don’t have to be so hard and you don’t have to do things all alone and you don’t have to stay in things that aren’t working for you. To anyone who wants to talk or ask questions regarding anything, please reach out. I wish you the best🩷",2024-11-12 08:52:17

I have been cramping pretty bad on the left side of my stomach/side of it for the past 2 days and recently started having brown and kinda pink discharge too (I don't know if the pink discharge is actually blood or not) I don't know if it is an infection or not because at the moment I am also ovulating and I know those 2 can be symptoms of ovulation. But the thing is, this has never happened to me before while ovulating, and another reason I'm scared of an infection is because I just got over a UTI, or which I thought I did, about 2-3 weeks ago. I don't know if it came back or if it never ended and then turned into something more serious. After a few days I thought I ended the UTI, my boyfriend and I had sex without a condom (I am on birth control and he pulled out), but I immediately went to the bathroom afterwards. I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday but I can't stop overthinking that I have something more serious and I am very impatient.

Just for reference my commute is 1h20 and I do this daily and work full time they have let my co workers work from home but not me.

I just got sat down with hr and the boss today and got a complaint because they listened to some of my conversations on outbound call (before last week they didn't listen to these kinda calls) where I vented over my mental health and yes I know i shouldn't have done that

But ur humanity is gone bcs i these 2 years I was late once and always flexible with my hours but u never gave anything back 

Now in September this year I got my paranoia back and got a mental breakdown and they sent me 3 health carers from my job who forces me to get back to work each time bcs I was physically fine 
(Their choice overules my doctors choice)

I'd pay to be able to punch that ugly man that thinks he is better than anyone and thinks he can treat his workers like sht now they said bcs of the condos they would have fire me but bcs of their own toxicity and stupidness they already have a problem with the fact that they don't have enough people handling their lines

I know its also that blonde haired btch who also thinks she is the sht and does nothing the whole day as teamcoach except for eating and going tot he kitchen and then walk around I've never even seen her handle a call or a mail and she only works half days 

Now they tell me I should have known about the commute causing a problem and that I did this to myself when I was promised into the fact that after 3 months I'd be able to walk from home but after 2 years it's still crickets 

Then can sck my no existing ckc I wish I could ruin their lives but I think  they already have miserable lives so let them they'll get their comeuppance one day

I did warn my colleagues that they now listen to the outbound calls so they know and don't have the same problem as me and they are planning to leave as well 😉

Now I kinda move on? Or so I thought? Until last week when I remembered that my twitter says that I made it in 2017 (a year in which I didn't even have my own personal phone). I vividly remember making a Twitter on 2018 so when I tried logging in I thought it was the 2018 one. BUT NOPE! IT WASNT, the 2018 was a different account and my now twitter acc (2017) was a suspended account that was connected somehow to my Gmail which was created on 2018. So now I'm kinda confused and scared that what if I created other accounts out there that I don't know about and someday it'll just come back again and haunt me. Anyways I don't really have the ability to prove that I have other accounts but I'm still scared cuz I literally don't know where I got my twitter acc from 😭

Tl:dr I think I'm getting paranoid that I posted/created things on the internet that I'm unaware of and I'm kinda embarrassed that it will just resurface but at the same time sad by the idea that it will be abandoned (does that make sense?) anyways I personally think it's kinda funny that this is one of the reasons I'm having a panic attack these past few days.

I've been going to cardiologists like once a year and they always tell me I am ok. This time they make me run while checking my heart rate and they told me it was all normal even with the chest pain, that my problem is I have no condition. 

But like, I keep trying but I still.avoid everything thinking this doctor is wrong and I might have something wrong. 

I got a perfect holter , a perfect blood pressure and a healthy heart ( that's what the doctor said ) 

But it's awful that I run a few seconds and I start to feel like I will die.

Ok so about a month ago I got a crazy panic attack for the first time in my life, never was anxious ever and I thought I was dying. After  that I started getting every symptom youve seen on this sub, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, chest pains, muscle twitches, headaches, sense of doom, etc etc. Fast forward one month I went thru some therapy, a lot of talking to my brain and I got myself to a much better place. 

At around week 2 I went to the doc and got ekg, which came back as a little quick but attributed to anxiety, and blood work

First round of blood work came back with high calcium 10.5 (high is 10.3) TSH was 1.6 (range 0.45-4.5) and T4 1.73 (range 0.88 - 1.77)

Also had slightly high cholesterol for 23y/o which wasn't good for my anxiety lol

So the doc ordered more tests, Calcium, PTH, and vit D. 

Calcium came back to normal again (9.8) and PTH is 17 (not sure what that means) bit vitamin d is low (28.1) I get a lot of sun so that's weird to me.

Been reading a lot how thyroid issues can cause anxiety especially if it's sudden anxiety (me), wondering what these numbers might mean in that regard

I also read how tsh and t4 at opposite ranges are concern for thyroid issues (my tsh was on the lower side and t4 almost too high, but both within normal range so not flagged) and also how vitamin d defiencency is closely related to thyroid. 

Unsure what the pth test is and what my numbers mean

I've been having a lot of thoughts about reaching out here on Reddit and hearing your thoughts on how you feel/experience your anxiety, cause I'm not sure if that is what I'm experiencing or if it is something else. 

So, in 2018 I started (for the first time in my life) not feeling well inside. I was going through a very rough breakup which took me a year or so before I started feeling like myself again. The thing was, that my body afterward somehow got ""stuck"" in the fight or flight mode and I've been fighting with quite a lot of physical symptoms ever since. I've never had a panic attack, I don't feel depressed, I'm not stressed, but either way, I often wake up at night with my heart beating through my chest and a big cold ""clump"" in my stomach - this also occurs during the day, at the office, at home, on a walk, at the gym. I rarely sleep more than 5 hours and during my day it feels like I have a surge of adrenaline, but I don't know why. 

My doctor tried to put antidepressants, but I couldn't really feel any difference and my sleep just got worse, so after trying a few different meds I decided to stop. 

Does any of you relate to this? What the hell is going on with my body? Is this anxiety? ",2024-11-12 11:15:15

Anxiety,1gph09f,Anxiety and loss of family member,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gph09f/anxiety_and_loss_of_family_member/,3,"Hi all,

My father passed away a couple of weeks ago and it's been very difficult. He lived on the other side of the country and when he passed we visited with my mom for the funeral and for support. Throughout that time I've felt ok, aside from being sad and upset about my father passing. Issues started once we returned home. My father passed away due to cardiac arrest. There seems to be a possibility of contributing issues but we probably won't know for certain. 

My issue started when I returned home from our visit and I almost immediately started experiencing chest pains and some discomfort. I wouldn't say I go to the doctor regularly but I have been a few times within the last couple of years, no issues with heart or anything. I actually had a number of tests done previously because I had a single ""anxiety attack"" a few years back and was concerned and not sure what happened. This just resolved itself and I've never really had issues since...until now. My father passing away has put my mom in a tough spot, my brother is stressed, im stressed, my wife is stressed, etc. I can of course go back to the doctor and get checked out. 

I feel reasonably confident my discomfort is related to this whole situation, though I don't feel actively concerned about things all the time. The pain and discomfort comes on when I start to think about it, or sometimes when I'm communicating with my family. I've tried applying a cold pack to my chest when it starts to act up and it has calmed me down and realived the discomfort. I haven't had issues sleeping, but as soon as I wake up it's like I start to think about the discomfort immediately and it starts to act up again.

I guess I'm looking for some experience with this and if it sounds like anxiety. Some of the typical breathing exercises and stuff tend to relieve me temporarily, and the ice as I mentioned, so I feel confident in this being anxiety. It's been going on for a week + now and no exactly sure what to do. 

Appreciate anyone's thoughts. Hope everyone is doing as well as can be expected.",2024-11-12 09:32:59

Context 
I have always been very attentive of my lower region per se, clean, safe play etc but the random aches and I mean maybe once a day or so really trigger my anxiety and then the negative thoughts come and tell me every disease I have and why my time on earth is cut short. 
Unfortunately these thoughts I obsess over, it’s why I’m very detailed in my explanation because I study them in my head all day long, if that makes any sense

She asked me about medication and to get in touch with the in office psychiatrist to get some medication. I have taken lorazepam before in the ER, heavy stuff, felt calm really really calm and just went to sleep so idk. I’m not scared of pills but it’s just a struggle to realize that I can’t do it on my own anymore. But…..everybody needs helps sometimes.

one of my friends came back from college for the weekend, and he texted me tonight if i wanted to hang out. so he picks me up and we plan to go on a drive. i immediately felt nervous because the smell of his car brought me back to a lot of anxiety. me and him used to smoke weed a lot, but i stopped because i almost greened out a few times, and i couldn't handle the feeling of nausea. he also was with me when i threw up from taking a zyn a few months ago, which was a really stupid decision. i feel like that experience, and then another bad weed experience that happened a few days later sort of started my spiral of anxiety and caused my issues to get a lot worse. his car smelled like a very distinct air freshener that he used, which kind of brought me back to hanging out with him and smoking. he passed me his weed pen, but i declined, as i've barely used weed in the past 5 months, and usually when i did, i would panic. seeing it made me feel even more nervous, though. he was also smoking it, which made it so i could smell the weed. i was really trying my best to not get too nervous or panicked, and for a while i was doing ok. he asked me if we should drive to chicago (we live like 20 minutes away) and i said sure because i wanted to seem chill. i didn't want him to think that there was anything wrong. once we got really close to chicago, though, he took another hit of weed, which again, made it so i could smell it. i started getting really nervous and opened the window, trying to hide the fact that i was starting to freak out. i began to have  panic attack, and felt like my entire body was being put under pressure. it also felt like i was going to vomit, which made me even more nervous. i told him that i was having a panic attack, and asked if we could turn around. he was really nice about it, and turned around and asked if i was ok. i kept my composure for the most part, but i almost broke down into tears. when i have a panic attack, it's genuinely one of, if not the worst feeling i've ever felt. it genuinely feels like i'm dying, and i get an immense feeling of hopelessness and doom whenever one happens. as we went back, i was still nervous, and could feel another wave of panic, but i thankfully breathed through it without him noticing. we hung out for like another hour in a parking lot really close to my house, but i told him that i needed to get going, not because i actually needed to, but because i could feel myself start panicking again.

i don't know what to do at this point, i just feel hopeless. i said yes to going to chicago because i wanted to get out of my comfort zone, but i guess it proved to be too much for me. i haven't been able to visit my friends or go on any sort of trips with them because i'm too scared to, as something like this would probably happen again. i'm in therapy, doing some light exposure work, but a lot of that is more based on my religious ocd rather than emetophobia. a few years ago, when i started seeing him, emetophobia was our main focus, and i improved quite a lot, to the point where i barely even thought about vomiting, but it became worse again after a few bad weed experiences and the zyn experience. the phobia seems 10x worse now, and i'm just generally a lot more anxious, as i often feel myself getting really worked up over things not even related to vomiting. i'm on zoloft, and am currently 2 weeks in on going back down to a 50mg dose, as 75mg made my issues worse i feel. i just need some advice on what to do. i haven't found a good answer on how to deal with my phobia or my panic attacks, or really much of my anxiety. i don't want to live like this, and i really just want to be able to do more stuff with my friends and family without worrying this much.

Anxiety,1gpfs34,What is your definition of anxiety?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpfs34/what_is_your_definition_of_anxiety/,1,"""anxiety"" is pretty standardised, for those who've never really been cursed with it. Anxiety isn't being concerned generally with how the future might pan out, or being in a state of nervous anticipation of something happening.
It's the feeling of mortal dread, in the pit of your stomach, every day, despite no rational reasoning. It's that feeling right as the rollercoaster tips, that turns your whole body inside out. For no rational reason. It's sweating uncontrollably, twitching or itching like a mother fucker. For no apparent reason other than you're outside amongst people. It's constantly feeling like a family member is going to die every time they step out the house, despite rationally knowing it's extremely unlikely.
It's a chronic and very debilitating issue that no one who's had experiences with it, would describe as a normal part of life. It turns people into fantastic actors though.",2024-11-12 07:58:17

So for context the medication is Lorazepam 0.5mg twice a day as needed, which after googling I think is a small dose.  My question is if most adults do 2-4mg can I up this myself and just take four of the pills? 
Has anyone ever taken lorazepam and cbd oil? Im in canada where it is legal but ive never tried just the oil.

Even just the job interview sends me into a panic that makes me feel I’ll faint on the sidewalk. Nearly 3 months ago I had nervous breakdown when I was offered a job while the people who are my entire support system (including my therapist) where on vacation. I was avoiding interviewing while everyone was gone and reorganizing myself but a friend reached out about this, so it was rude for me to say “I can’t interview now” without a valid explanation. I really don’t want to share my anxiety struggles with friends. I was offered the job  and accepted but with reservations if they would come through on promises they made. It was a leap of faith and they let me down so I’m back on the job hunt. Tomorrow is my first interview and honestly I am scared. The breakdown and the severe panic attack I suffered while all alone (in the country no less) was traumatizing. I’m scared of ending up in that dark place again. I’m really trying to work through it, sit with my anxiety and be ok. I am filled with so much shame, guilt and fear. I guess I just want some words of encouragement.

After  that I started getting every symptom youve seen on this sub, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, chest pains, muscle twitches, headaches, sense of doom, etc etc. Fast forward one month I went thru some therapy, a lot of talking to my brain and I got myself to a much better place. 

At around week 2 I went to the doc and got ekg, which came back as a little quick but attributed to anxiety, and blood work

First round of blood work came back with high calcium 10.5 (high is 10.3) TSH was 1.6 (range 0.45-4.5) and T4 1.73 (range 0.88 - 1.77)

Also had slightly high cholesterol for 23y/o which wasn't good for my anxiety lol

So the doc ordered more tests, Calcium, PTH, and vit D. 

Calcium came back to normal again (9.8) and PTH is 17 (not sure what that means) bit vitamin d is low (28.1) I get a lot of sun so that's weird to me.

Been reading a lot how thyroid issues can cause anxiety especially if it's sudden anxiety (me), wondering what these numbers might mean in that regard

I also read how tsh and t4 at opposite ranges are concern for thyroid issues (my tsh was on the lower side and t4 almost too high, but both within normal range so not flagged) and also how vitamin d defiencency is closely related to thyroid. 

Unsure what the pth test is and what my numbers mean

When I told my DSA proffessor ""Maam it's actually pronounced as xyz"" ... She went ""Yeah whatever"" and for some reason this hurt me... 

Same happened when I told my business professor... ""Sir you pronounced my name wrong, it's actually xyz"" ... and He went ""Be glad I atleast took your name ..."" 

Are all uni professors this incosiderate or is it me, who's oversensitive? Like I get it... not a big deal but things like this really ruin my mood. 

When I see the same professors being so nice to other students, I get really jealous. Why could they not be nice to me? 

We had an online class yesterday... the same DSA professor asked a question.. I knew the answer so typed quickly in the chat box... the professor gave no response... 3 min later another student replied the same thing and she went ""Yeah abc gave the right answer""... MY ANSWER WAS JUST THERE ABOVE HERS""... 

Except for a few, classfellows are the same. We had a quiz on gates and circuits ...a topic that I really know by heart. 

I saw this girl struggling with truth tables so I offered to help her ... but guess what? She preffered to go and ask the ""better girl""...honestly it hurt and ykw the ""better girl"" got the question wrong and I got it right but *sighs* who cares 

At this point, I don't even bother. I lit sit in a corner, attend lectures and come back. Don't participate in any class discussions because of the fear of being *ignored* ...even if I know the answer to questions, I don't answer and watch till others figure it out and watch them being praised.. its OKAY...

Anxiety,1gpbqgv,Leg tingling/ticklish sensation post panic attack,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gpbqgv/leg_tinglingticklish_sensation_post_panic_attack/,1,"Hi guys I’ve been dealing with a pretty bad episode with health anxiety for the past 8 months now. Started with worrying about a cold sore to now worrying that I’m developing MS/ALS because of calve twitches and tingling. 

For the past month I’ve been getting odd vibrations in my legs that sort of subsided for about a week until I started to hyper fixate on my calves twitching. Last Wednesday during class, I felt like I was going to have a panic attack twice during class and although I didn’t, it left me rattled with stomach pain and cold sweats. Ever since, I’ve been dealing with tingling in both my calves usually. It gets worse with rest it seems, but better with running and under complete distraction (funny enough I noticed that I didn’t feel this sensation while typing this lol). Ive also been noticing this odd feeling of adrenaline rush that seems to fester in my legs and then shoot up into my chest making me feel like I’m about to completely black out or lose it. I get those feelings probably 1-2 times a day now. 

I went to the doctor and I was pretty much told that there are no nerve issues to be concerned about and no apparent weakness (although my legs feel like jello almost 24/7 now). My vitals were fine and I went home with muscle relaxers for my mild lower back strain. I trust my doc, but I don’t know how to move forward with anxiety. I feel stuck in this “nervous system overload,” feeling and it just creates this feedback loop of “physical sensation > anxiety > increase in physical sensation”

I don’t know what to do, it’s driving me crazy and this physical sensation in particular has been the most depressing for me because I’m unable to enjoy my life. If anyone out there has some advice I’d surely appreciate it! ",2024-11-12 03:40:29

Since I can remember I’ve had anxiety and obsessive thoughts of how people view me. I feel I have to be perfect in others eyes, the perfect friend, girlfriend, sister, daughter ect. And even to strangers. My home has to be perfectly clean and organized all the time for my sanity and to keep up with the ‘perfect’ appearance. I feel very hyper aware of people’s feelings and I get anxious if someone doesn’t seem like they like me, thus causing me to bend and shape into anything I thing the other person wants me to be lol. Typing this out is making me realize how exhausting and crazy it is that I do this! I think I’ve done it for so long it sometimes feels like second nature to me, like this is just how I am as a person and sometimes doesn’t even feel like something I need to work on until i really think about it and compare to those around me. My friends don’t care what others think of them. For example, a friend and I got invited to a dinner party. The host said it is not required to bring anything, so my friend did not. She just showed up and enjoyed herself. Me however, I spent the week stressing about making a small appetizer, and what kind of gift I would get the host for hosting. I made it so much harder for myself even though we didn’t have to bring a thing but because I wanted to be liked and thought of as I’ll just be honest, ‘better’ than the average person I put this pressure on myself to stand out. It most likely comes from a place of ego but I also truly do enjoy doing things like this and making people feel special. So that’s where it gets confusing to me. I also have an anxiety around fast food and if someone sees me eating something that’s labeled as ‘unhealthy’. Like ordering takeout or like a pizza to my door and risking a neighbor seeing me grab my takeout from the driver and going back inside is like my worst nightmare. Or going and picking up food from a fast food place gives me anxiety because I don’t want people to know I eat it. I know it sounds insane lol. One more is keeping my house clean and clutter free at all times because 1. It gives me extreme anxiety when anything is out of its place, I can’t think straight ect. And 2. I do this just in case someone knocks on my door and they for some reason have to come inside and if I have any signs of me actually living I feel embarrassed about the thought of something seeing that. If maintenance comes over I’m deep cleaning so they don’t think im a messy tenant. I’m tryingggg to work on it but I don’t think I realized just how much it affects me until I typed it out.

I’m probably a little older than many here.  But a simple word of advice: take your health meds regularly.

I’m a lifelong sufferer of social anxiety.  I have high blood pressure, moderately high cholesterol and am pre-diabetic.  I’m classified as overweight (not obese).  Obviously weight does factor into the 3 risk factors I have.  But I slowly stopped taking my meds over the months & years.  Reasons: sure laziness & forgetfulness, but mostly fear of going to the doctor.  And going to the doctor when you know that your BP is going to be sky high makes you want to go even less.  

So that leads to 10 days ago-I had an ischemic stroke at age 56.  BP was 260/roughly 140 when they picked me up by ambulance.  I consider myself lucky: no apparent memory or learning issues.  Some coordination issues as my eyes still react slowly to walking (I started PT today).  Thank God I have a loving wife who not only didn’t question me but has taken a considerable amount of time off work to visit me at the hospital & appointments.  I also have good insurance which is rare.

No, most of the anti depressants never really worked for me & I begrudgingly will take them now as prescribed.  But I will also always take my health meds as prescribed.  I take my blood pressure twice daily, I walk more (even if the coordination doesn’t come back) and I will continue going to PT as long as they allow or improvement shows.

I guess a TLDR is: anxiety alone is bad.  Allowing it to take your health away is worse & doesn’t reduce the anxiety.",2024-11-11 22:29:48

I texted my family for help in that moment, unsure of what to do. We called for help and I just had to hope I'd be okay.

By the time help arrived, I was already feeling quite a bit better, and the EKG showed no signs of issues involving my heart. All of that had to have been a panic attack.

And I cannot believe a panic attack could cause such horrendous symptoms, and to such a severe degree. I've never experienced all of that at once. Has anyone else had these symptoms?

I'm afraid to sleep now, out of fear of waking up to another panic attack. But I'm so tired.

I even sometimes snooze my alarm and go back to sleep with no issue. but for some reason just initially falling asleep (or the anticipation of such) has been keeping me up. recently the only way I can beat this is by just staying awake until I just pass out from exhaustion. does anyone know if this is a thing other people have dealt with and if there's a way to deal with it?

I've been on this dose for about eight years now I think. I've been okay, I found I still had some anxiety but the Zoloft made it so I could actually apply logic and stop myself before I spiralled too deep into the dark anxiety pit of dispair. 

I also always had Ativan 1mg as a backup. It was one of those things that just kind of sat in my cupboard mostly unused, but it gave me comfort knowing it was there if I needed it. And of course I did need it every now and again. 

I wrote a bit about my flare up in a previous post so I won't go into too much about it, but I have not been good lately. 

I used all my Ativan before my next appointment with my psychiatrist, because I usually only get prescribed 30, with no refill, even it's four or six months between appointments. This time I used all 30 within a span of 45 days.  So obviously I am not doing as well as I am used to. 



I have my appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow am I'm so nervous about what's going to happen. I'm hoping she will bump up my Zoloft, or give me something to go with it. I'm scared she won't give me any Ativan to help me while I'm going through this. 

I trust my doctor implicitly - she's got me through 19 years of anxiety. But I can't help being scared about what's coming. 

Does anyone else feel like this when you know a new dose or medication is coming? What are your positive experiences with it?

I don't even remember how I thought before my OCD got this bad. Or well, I do. But I don't know if I'll ever get it down to that level. While it was bothering me back then, it was not nearly as debiliating as it is now, with my sleep being affected and everything I do being doubted by my mind. My thought patterns are so automatic, stopping myself from doing them also gets very overwhelming. And I think I'm in a constant state of dissociation because of the OCD because I don't really feel much, even though I have BPD which usually gave me incredibly strong emotional reactions about everything. 

I just wanna feel like me again and have thoughts without constant compulsions in my head. ;w; ",2024-11-11 21:17:56

But when I do, it’s hard to properly listen to what they’re actually saying. 

I tend to do an awkward dance between looking away while listening, and then forcing myself to look at them in order to seem natural.

Anxiety,1gp8jm6,Needing reassurance after dying hair,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gp8jm6/needing_reassurance_after_dying_hair/,0,"My anxiety used to be manageable until I took cipro back in 2016, experienced my first panic attack and have had issues off and on ever since. Last couple years though, with this year since May in particular, my anxiety is at an all time extreme for how out of wack it is. 

Specifically I think it’s focused on medical/health and a fixation on allergic reactions. 

After having bad reactions to a few prescriptions, I am terrified of taking anything new. I’ve had an awful relationship with food and it’s a battle every day to eat because something that was safe yesterday or this morning may make me feel off now (if this makes sense), so on and so forth.

All this to say I dyed my hair today. Was already not feeling great (see weird food bs) but pushed myself to do it anyway. Problem is, I read the dye box. I have never done a strand test before and dyed my hair off and on for like 20 years now, so theoretically I should be fine, but the more I read about it the more I learn that an allergy can pop up at any time and if you have tattoos (I do) it can make you more susceptible (this was on the box for the dye too) to a reaction. I didn’t even let the dye stay on as long as I normally would, and basically had an anxiety attack while in the shower rinsing it out. 

Dye has been out of my hair for over 3 hours already but I’ve read some people can still get reactions as late as 6 weeks after dying their hair! So I’ve been in a state of panic for hours and just need some help outside of my own head reminding me that it’s super unlikely that anything will happen and if it does I live close to a hospital and can just go there, it will suck financially but not be the end of the world. 

Please. 🙏 and thank you! 🖤🖤🖤",2024-11-12 00:59:14
Anxiety,1gp8hie,Skipping heart beats continuously / heart problem or just some kind of anxiety,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gp8hie/skipping_heart_beats_continuously_heart_problem/,8,"Ill start with a quick background , at the start of last year i had some sort of panic attack from nowhere (tho i didnt think its a panic attack) but ive been under stress at that time, i was sitting at the computer and i felt that my heart just stopped and like my tension dropped and i might feint ( i didnt actually feint or stuff like that but the feeling i just might) , i went to get some water and half way to the kitchen my heart start speeding and i felt that all the blood got into my head, i had to sit down in the place i was for 10 mins and i got better but after this episode the ""fun"" started.

For about a year and a half i had a big migraine and accelerated heart beat + all sorts of weird stuff , like my left leg felt a bit numb sometimes ,  with one eye i was seeing blurry or like i had a sunglass lens over it , i thought that i had a stroke and in the next 6 months did all the tests , brain MRI and CT , thyroid test, blood sugar test ( that was at the upper limit but in range) , and 3 EKGs at ER + 2 chest scan + eye tests etc.. + 1 doppler scan (all of them last year), all were good but the idea was that when i did them i didnt had ""skipped heartbeats"" was just my heart speeding and i had pain in my chest (left side), the doctor that did the doppler said that my heart shows signs of stress but in the rest is in good shape.

During this period i took some anxiety pills (from my neuro doctor) 2-3 months a type and 2-3 months other type but i didnt feet that they help in any way with my migraine and stuff (and i wasnt depressed or scared) but having a lot of supplements (CA + MG + B1 , 6, 12 etc) seemed to help my heart problem , no more pain and rarely skipping beats (like one or two once in while), so i quit taking any anxiety pills (been like a year from last time i took them).

In the past 3 -4 months i got rid of the migraine and most of the other effects (and got a new one that comes and goes, tinnitus), i was just starting to feel human again , and in the past month i was feeling normal but first i had an episode of my heart skipping beats all night  (from nowhere), but just like one after another not like one here and there, and big pain chest in the left side .. after few days went away now they randomly GOT Back and i have them from a week now.

So im feeling fine (best i ever been in the past 2 years) but i am just having a big pain in the chest in the heart zone that sometimes radiates  to the back / shoulders  (randomly im having less pain in this moment , it went a way for a bit) but my heart is ""skipping"" a beat like each 10 seconds (its better during the day but full at night) , and its like hitting my chest when its skipping , i have an pulse o2 metter and i see on the graphic that its empty when this happens , like the heart didnt beat  (so its not just in my head) , and it does so hard i feel like its having a tendril and it wont start again  but the pulse is ok (it happens even i have 70 or 100bpm) and feels decent regulated pulse , tension is also ok , like 122/ 87.

I dont know what to make of this , did doctors missed something? The big pain and the skipped ""heartbeats""  that goes almost for 14-16 hours sometimes every 10 seconds every day and very strong can be only from anxiety? I was feeling just fine and nothing happened to make something like this happen, i was actually happy that i was feeling good. Should i go to ER or should i wait 3 more days and go to my doctor for some more tests? They tend to stop at 7 AM and i can sleep but they keep me up all night, playing Online Chess or something that distracts me a lot seems to make them pause for couple of minutes but they always getting back (during the day they can go away for a couple of hours).

Hope you guys are feeling better than me atm, some opinions on this would be nice.

Edit: Also didnt drink any coffe past 5 days or alcohol, i am a smoker but i didnt smoke only did some light vaping because im stress out of this condition , i took MG and all types of stuff and nothing seems to help, also my lips are a bit dry and im drinking a lot of water/tea.",2024-11-12 00:56:24

Ever since I moved from a super small city to a more popular, progressive city, I've had pretty bad anxiety. Driving in a small town was so easy and people were so polite. Now I live in a really cool place but there's more crime in more populated places. Also the driving is TERRIBLE - this city is literally in the top 3 worst places to drive. Theres a lot of rude people here, too. Then on top of everything, my best friend took her life a year ago. My anxiety is so high that I've developed depersonalization, especially in big crowds and while im driving during peak traffic. I cant escape it, either. I work events that are very partyish. Outside of my immense grief and anxiety, my career has skyrocketed since leaving my hometown. I've technically reached a huge milestone but it's like my brain is finding ways to not let myself enjoy the fruits of my labor. 
.

It's insane that I'm like this. I've gone to New York City by myself and traveled alone for 4 weeks. I've driven to Alberquerque and lived alone for an internship for a month. I used to go to huge, crowded concerts alone. I was such a badass. It was just like 1.5 years ago this started happening. I know this depersonalization is temporary and I will get through it. I just need a little support.

Of course the pandemic has had an effect on everybody but what I mean specifically is a sense of confusion over what is troubling them. Like I will come out of a therapy session processing things from my past and then get hit with pandemic and environmental anxieties or vice versa. I struggle more often to know if what I'm dealing with is related to personal traumas and struggles or environmental stressors. Like before the pandemic I felt like I could more clearly identify what was bugging than I have the past few years where everything just feels like a mess. I've had a lot more feelings of confusion as to what what is bothering me because there has been so much to deal with. I've found myself start to cry for one thing and before I know I'm crying about something else. Its like the rate of change of stress is harder to manage. Like I'm bailing water out of boat slower than I'm taking on water. I've been more confused, doubtful, and frustrated. I'm not only had confusion about my anxieties but have also had more anxiety/ocd doubts about the good things I do to help myself. Like before the pandemic I knew what would keep me afloat despite my struggles whereas now I feel more doubtful and second guessing the the good things I do because I can never reach pre pandemic levels of stability.

That is another thing that bugs me. During the height of the pandemic it was ok to not be ok and I didn't feel so alone and my anxieties actually calmed down when the world was going slow but ever since things opened back up my anxieties have gotten worse and I feel more left behind, alone, and confused. So many people including sometimes myself say I should be able to bounce back but I have been unable to.

Is anybody else feeling this way? I'm not looking for advice as much as I just don't want to feel alone in this struggle.",2024-11-12 00:08:02

Anxiety,1gp5dgu,A cycle of anxiety ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gp5dgu/a_cycle_of_anxiety/,0,"Hello. 

I am here because I wanted to ask others on their advice and guidance if anyone understands and is familiar with these experiences (which I'm sure many are, considering the subreddit this is going to be posted to).

(Sorry, I don't know if stuff like this is overly discussed). 

  
I am currently an undergrad student at university (final year). For years I have tried managing and improving my anxiety, and every time I try restructuring, it quickly reverts. 

The main issue I am addressing here is my daily cycle. I become very anxious about working and procrastinate a lot. Sometimes I am very anxious and become sort of paralysed, where I am very shaky and find it hard to breathe. My work and other chores only get done when I get to a point when it is too late and the work HAS to be done (like just before a deadline, or doing reading at 2am). And then when I put myself to bed, I procrastinate sleeping as well, because I know I'll just be stuck with my anxiety filled thoughts, guilty and annoyed that I went to bed late, and will be very tired the next day. Then the next day comes around and of course I am very very tired, and had to wake up later then I always want to because I'm too tired. Then again, I spend a while procrastinating getting up and starting my day of duties, and the cycle continues.   
  
These kind of feelings are pretty normal for me during this time of year. Anxiety, has been something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember (got diagnosed with ASD a few years ago), and even sought help through counselling, forms of meditation, and medication. But I cannot seem to shake this cycle, these feeling... I feel like I cannot improve and feel so much guilt every time I cannot keep up with plans to improve (medication or advice) so will just avoid it often. And I only really address these feelings when I am at my lowest, like now, because when I am generally calm I don't want to think about addressing these issues, it would mean I would lose that moment of calmness. 

  
To sort of deal with this, I have made myself super busy with activities and clubs at uni, which I love, but I know a big reason I do them is to give myself a break and not stress like crazy for a bit of time. There are times when I know I don't really feel like going out and doing a club activity and would much rather stay at home, but I still go because I'd rather that than dealing with my anxiety in my head. I also started using more instant ways of silencing the rampant thoughts through certain substances (not sure if I can specify here, but nothing dangerous), which I am nervous might be turning into a dependence. 

  
I worry that this will never go away, I don't want to live with it for the rest of my life. Although I am aware anxiety will never truly go away, it would be nice for it to not run my life. And I just want to say I am very happy with my life, all I want is to live it as best as I can, I will never give up on this life. 



So, I just want to see if anyone has advice. I appreciate that improving upon this will not be quick or easy. And I may not be great at maintaining plans of management, but I want to keep attempting. 

Thank you. ",2024-11-11 22:36:33

She put me on this medicine clonidine which I have been on for 3 weeks and I'm not sure its working. Im still having anxiety but not really having panic attacks. I thought I be feeling somewhat normal but as I'm writing this, I'm having anxiety at the moment. I'm 6' 230 lbs. should I be taking more? She also gave me hydroxine in case I need it. That seems to work better but I don't want to depend on this medicine. My story is I never experienced anxiety until 5 years ago when I was at the gym and my heart went into afib. I thought I was going to die because I had no idea what it was. I seemed to have controlled it, but it just overtakes me, and I feel so week mentally. Flashforward my cardiologist has the AFIB under control but I'm always thinking about that trigger and how profound it was for me. Now, with everything going on in my life I hate feeling this way and maybe its health anxiety, but does anyone have any experience with this medication, and could you offer me some advice how to not think about it, sorry for venting but I have no one else who seems to want to help me. ps. when I see my therapist she just talks about current events which i don't care for.

I went to the ER a few days ago to get some scans after I had a panic attack because I couldn’t remember things at work and felt ‘off.’ My CT showed up clear which is a good sign but once I was laying down I experienced vertigo for the first time in my life which was very strange. I have a follow up appointment on the 22nd of this month with a neurologist but with college commitments piling up, it feels like I am drowning in anxiety about my ability to perform academically and my physical health. I feel so disoriented and unable to complete basic tasks such as simple conversation much less exams or formal presentations. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend, probably my biggest emotional supporter, broke up with me 5 days ago.

I don't know how common this is for people to feel because it happens more than I want it to do even if it isn't all the time.

To which I had relatively no emotion...logically in my head I knew that it was meant to be mean...I UNDERSTOOD that I should be mad and that I wish I could defend myself but in the moment I more or less just went blank and was void of any identifiable feeling. As the result I really had no response and the conversation more or less got left there as I am quite avoidant. TLDR of it is that I've never been good at standing up for myself since I was a kid but now more than ever I realize I can't even identify how I feel to begin to confidently articulate it and my gravitation is always towards freezing.

Since coming back from our holiday in September (and doing the big holiday clothes wash) it has got messy and clothes are piling up and up and up. It's got to the point where I don't even like going in there anymore. I have started doing my hair and makeup in front of the hallway mirror. Strangest thing is I am not an untidy person. Every other room of my house is immaculate: clean, organised and tidy but it's like this job has become so big that it feels so overwhelming and daunting. In truth, it would probably only take a few hours to organise the clothes again and put them away but I cannot bring myself to do it. It's making me anxious and I feel like a failure because of it. 

I have asked my partner if he will help me with it and he acts like I am being crazy - 'it's just clothes, stop being dramatic'. He even puts his own clothes away in the wardrobe around mine and still won't help. I don't even necessarily need him to tidy them away, I think I just want him in the room with me whilst I do it. I'd ask a friend but I am embarrassed of the room now and don't want people in there. FYI the room isn't dirty, just messy with clothes and things.

Never in my life have I had a job make me feel this way. In fact, I'll put time aside at the weekend to do it and instead I will clean all the cupboards in the kitchen or do DIY, paint walls and hang pictures etc. These are far more challenging tasks so I cannot figure out why I cannot do this. It's almost like I am blowing it up in my head and now I am stuck.

Please, has anyone experienced this. I know many of you are probably thinking 'just tidy the room' but if it was that easy I would have done it by now. I feel like a prize idiot but I am stressing. I am very house proud so this is just another anxiety to add to my list. Any advice would be greatly appreciated x

Q I think, my thoughts are so vivid, too  much so. When I’m walking and thinking a quick paced thought, I start to walk faster.

I may find myself thinking of a romantic gesture (I do not have a romantic interest) then I jump and squeal only to stop myself as I’m about to roll on the bed. 

I may imagine an action scene and I’ll jump and quickly stride out of my room in active excitement only to cool down 2seconds after I realize what I’m doing. When I read a sad novel I may pause it and start to imagine myself in that situation (physically acting the pain till I cry)

This is quite often an unspecific worry (general dread). And sometimes (as is the case at the moment) it is all health focussed. 

I very much focus on one thing at a time, and ruminate on it. At the moment it tends to come out as anxiety and stress over health issues. Saturday I thought I was having circulation issues. Yesterday I spent the day thinking my heart hurt. Today I spent the day thinking my hair was falling out. (I wonder if this is because I’m trying to avoid thinking about the important things!)

Anyway, my question is, When I do focus on each thing, that area of my body sort of hurts (or feels different). Is that a psychological thing where I’m thinking about it and making myself think that it aches when it doesn’t, or is it a physical thing where it probably is the same feeling as any day but I’m being hyper sensitive to it as I’m thinking about it?

We have been in regular communication, calls, texts, FaceTime, but it’s not helping much. Trying to sleep last night was so hard. Sitting at work right now I can hardly focus, my heart is racing, so is my mind. I feel depersonalization, brain fog, tingly hands, I lost my appetite completely which is making me feel weak too. I want to just run home but then our home will be empty so I don’t want to be there either lol. 

She doesn't return until next weekend and I’m trying so hard to cope.

I *hate* being in trouble, even a little bit, and I’ve always gone to pretty exhausting, honestly neurotic, lengths to avoid being in trouble.

I know it’s *just a speeding ticket* and they don’t really mean much.

Anxiety,1gowg5u,Sudden cramp in chest - panic attack?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gowg5u/sudden_cramp_in_chest_panic_attack/,4,"Hi everyone. I haven’t had a panic attack in weeks. My first one was in June, and I thought it was a heart attack. After that, I mostly had “mild” attacks, but there was a period where they happened daily, and I really hit rock bottom. I didn’t leave the house. Now, for the past two months, things have been going well, except for hives, stomach issues, and heart palpitations. But mentally, I actually feel okay otherwise.

Two days ago, I was in line at the airport to board, and just before that, I had messaged my friend saying how well I was doing and that I hadn’t had any panic attacks in weeks. And of course… while in line, I suddenly felt a kind of cramp in the chest area and immediately felt short of breath, and then I broke out in a sweat. I also felt a bit lightheaded. The cramp or pain subsided within a minute. I still felt a bit short of breath and very anxious afterward. About 10 minutes later, it happened again but to a lesser degree. Then on the plane, I felt uncomfortable for at least 45 more minutes. There wasn’t any more cramp or pain, but I ended up back in a negative cycle, thinking something might be wrong with my heart. That’s one of my biggest issues: health anxiety.

I had an ECG done, and everything looked fine; there were two PVCs (palpitations) seen, but according to my doctor, that’s nothing serious and is caused by stress. I have an appointment with her on Tuesday for my hives, and I’m going to bring this up and ask for another heart echo to hopefully reassure myself.

But my question to you all is: does anyone else recognize this kind of cramp-like feeling in the chest? That comes out of nowhere and it really surprises you in a way. It goes away quickly but happens with shortness of breath and other symptoms. I find it so hard sometimes to recognize a panic attack.",2024-11-11 16:37:13

I know Sunday scaries are common among all people. 

But, my anxiety and depression are so dark on Sundays to the point I dread the day of the week now. I am filled with grief, sorrow, heaviness, and intense anxiety. I feel like the weight of all existential doom is on my shoulders. This has been going on for several months now. Just a few notes:
-I don’t dislike my job, it’s manageable and is going well
-this is not particular to if I go out/do not go out/drink/not drink the night prior 
-I am getting adequate sleep 
-symptoms are crying on and off for the whole day, heart racing, exhaustion 
-I am medicated for anxiety already 

Regardless of these things, it’s hard for me to even function on any Sunday. So much so, that even on Fridays now I am dreading that Sunday is coming up.

I have been skipping classes and not passing any schoolwork because I'm so afraid of opening up those apps and checking for myself. 

I went to therapy. Used the tools given to me. They worked in unexpected ways. Still not helping. I still can't find any alternative thoughts but it did help me realize that one of the root causes of my anxiety and was able to talk it out with my dad who was thankfully more open-minded than he was before.

I don't feel as tense and on edge as before. Also had me thinking a lot about myself through journaling.

I... feel so amazing with a lot of breakthroughs that I did but I still did not feel comfortable opening the apps. I have accepted the consequences of my actions of MIA. I'm even okay with my groupmates who I have left hanging hating me. 

So what's wrong? I feel so... wrong again.

I meditated. Then used the tools again. Challenged my thoughts. And it made me realize. I am not afraid that I have so many backlogs. or that I will definitely fail midterms. or that I've left a bad impression on my professors.

I am more so afraid of what I would feel if I saw the mess I have left behind. I'm afraid that it would break me. Hurt me. I'm afraid to feel what I felt back then...

I've always struggled with anxiety.These past 3 days I was away,in order to work on my final project,it takes place in a different city than the one I live in.So I was there for what we call site analysis.
I've had this feeling where,in the middle of work I would get these ""brain jumps"" randomly,reality checks of negative emotions.It would last seconds,and the feeling would also be physical,in my chest,as if I was in danger and I would get out of it with a breath or two.
Eventually it would go away.The first day it happened 3 or 4 times, the second day,about 15 times,and today I'm feeling so overwhelmed I can't function properly.

I worry because in the past I have suffered from quite intense insomnia, that a puppy or even fully grown dog might wake me at night or in the mornings with barking and that would worsen my anxiety.

On the other hand, I am pretty sure I would love to spend every minute with my dog and would even take it to work with me. Animals have a powerful effect on me, even meeting a stray cat on an off day can turn my whole day around.

Even the idea of getting a dog, has lifted my anxiety the past few days, I feel, just by contemplating, reading about it etc.

What is your experience with owning a dog while suffering from anxiety?

They do exist they just don't come back and post in Anxiety :) 

I tried all sorts of drugs but eventually the thing that helped me was Quetiapine initially to allow me to sleep and relax and then I went on the supplements big time. Make sure your nervous system is healthy. You are made up a of chemicals and your body needs the right chemicals to function. I took Multilvitamins and extra vit D and C.

I feel like my world has come to an end. I live in a red state and I have no resources to leave. Day by day I’m becoming increasingly paranoid. I don’t feel safe. 

I grew up in the church and for most of my childhood I have felt as if God was watching me, my thoughts, my actions, my every move. I used to stay awake all night and pray over and over again because I felt as if I messed my prayer up I was going to be punished. 

I have spent so much of my life deconstructing from that anxiety and reminding myself that my thoughts are mine and mine alone & no one can hear them or dictate what I do.

Now I feel as all of that is completely gone. Now it’s not God watching me, it’s the government and all the men around me. I keep having visions of them burning my books and taking things away, taking me away. I feel like they are watching me through my phone. My neighbor has a camera that faces towards our yard that has always been there but now every time I see it I am terrified and am thinking about what I said that he could have heard. I’m even becoming paranoid of my own father. I have no idea how I am supposed to live my life after this.

I told my friend that I wouldn’t flirt w him again because I didn’t want to get hurt. 

Well, my friend told me a few days ago that they are flirting. I didn’t really think anything of it and pretty much said “there’s nothing wrong with that, just be careful” 

Last night she confronted me and said “I feel like whenever you’re talking to the guy friend you hide your phone from me” I reassured her that I don’t try to do that. She asked if him and I were flirting and I told her yes. She immediately got really upset because I didn’t tell her. We are currently on a trip and have a 7 hour drive back home today. I ended up having the worst panic attack of my life and it lasted throughout the night (still recovering). 

She told me that she’s just really upset and hurt but that this will not change our friendship and that she just needs time. But my anxiety is going insane over that. I feel like I can’t breathe and I can’t stop shaking.

I have a small group of friends that I absolutely love, I just feel a lot of the times latley nobody has the time or energy for me. I know we all get busy or have things in life that we need to take care of but it just seems like NOBODY has the time or wants to do anything when I ask. 

I think this has been a lot harder for being recently because I used to hang out with my roommate a ton, she is my best friend and like my other half. I know that she’s been going through some stuff herself, but we live together and I rarely see her. Lately I’ve been asking her to do things with me because I know we are both off, and she will just ignore me or not answer. I think recently, I’ve just been a lot more hurt about it because she has some new friends that she’s been hanging out with. I’m not even bothered by the new friends, but even just a response I’m busy with some other people tonight would be so so nice. 

I just feel like I am a person that has a lot of care and wants to give a lot to people and have good connections, I just don’t feel like anything is too deep nowadays. I still value these people a lot and I still care about them, I just don’t think it’s being reciprocated at all almost. I know that there are people that do care and it’s not like I’m trying to take away from any of that. But it’s really hard putting so much value on people to feel like nobody’s in your corner.

I want people in my life that I feel like genuinely want me around and genuinely care about me and how I’m doing . Having people that don’t even take the time to hang out get together, or let alone just have simple conversations just don’t have meaning. I don’t know. I feel like there is many aspects to the situation and I could just go on about it forever.

Feeling less alone might help. And if you have solutions, do let me know..

I am a high achiever and would generally be viewed as successful. When I am feeling good about myself, life is good. But I for a long time now have gone through these anxious episodes that usually get triggered by a belief that I am not good enough at something or can't handle something. The problem is that I get so obsessive about my anxiety that I can hardly think about anything else, and it makes it hard to go about daily life. This lasts for months and usually wears me down until I reach a breaking point. Every interaction with people feels forced and unnatural. I just don't know what to say, how to care about anything. I am so self concious. The original anxiety source is now not even the main problem, the main problem is I can't think or act or feel normal. I try meditating, exercising, reframing thoughts, positive thinking. But I can't escape it unless I just quit everything which I have done several times in the past but it's obviously not a healthy coping mechanism. My therapist and others say I am too critical of myself and to be self compassionate but these symptoms are REAL and they really incapacitate my ability to function.

My whole life was falling apart because of this and I just couldn’t manage to do anything, it spiralled and my life basically fell apart, getting kicked out of my uni since I couldn’t get myself to write a stupid appeal, and loosing months of my life. 

Just this morning I was considering delaying the doctors appointment, because I couldn’t figure out how to articulate my problems properly. I couldn’t condense things into a symptoms list, what do I start with? 

And I just went and I didn’t have the list so I just had to randomly start with something, and I guess my crying and rambling easily displayed my anxiety anyway, so it didnt even matter that I hadn’t compiled a perfect narrative. He managed to get therapy referral. 

Anyway I feel dumb as hell. I feel like a weight has lifted off my chest. 

I have learnt before that you just need to confront things, and not avoid them. 

But it’s hard to let go of that, because I guess now it feels so stupid that it ruled my life these last few months. Why didn’t I just do the thing? 

But I get into bouts of avoidance sometimes where it is debilitating I guess, and I want to pull myself out of it but I think I just can’t realise that I’m living in my head way too much. 

Part of the problem is that I chronically downplay all of my problems. Which is why I didn’t get help. But now that I got help it was so easy I might go back to downplaying things again. 

I don’t want to make this struggle my identity, i refused to identify it as anxiety the whole time. 

But now that I’m actually getting some help or being taken seriously, I think I’m scared to make progress/ go back to normal, because I feel like it discounts all the genuine struggle I had through these last months?

I guess I just want to get genuine help. And it’s like I keep undermining myself.

Anxiety,1gnzouq,20 years with Anxiety.,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnzouq/20_years_with_anxiety/,9,"Hello all.

Just wanted to share.  I developed anxiety after a nervous breakdown at 25. I'm 44.

I read your posts and have compassion for the suffering you feel.

My anxiety started with panic attacks and gad. Its progressed, since Covid, to social anxiety.

I knew that i needed new tools and a lifestyle change.

So, two tools i highly recommend (plus diet, exercise and hobbies):

**Wheel of Awareness meditation - Dan Siegel.**  

Explanation:  I do the 30 minute version on his website.  There is research to back up this meditation.  It involves the visual image of a wheel, with a hub at the centre.  It covers the five senses, interior of the body, mental activities and interconnectedness (compassion) and awareness itself at the centre.  

How it helps anxiety:  my experience is, it helps to create awareness and space of the bodily and mental things going on in me.  It gives me space, so i'm not overwhelmed.

An example.  I got shouted at by my boss in front of the office.  Social anxiety really kicked in.  I felt like crying. I sat with it and felt it in my body.  My chest pounding with fear and wanting to leave.  Heat in my face, burning from shame. Hot tears wanting to come.  It moved down to my stomach, where i felt shame, then anger in the pit of my stomach.  Once i'd sat with these, i realised anger wanted me to be assertive and set boundaries.  

Actually, i cared more about what was going on within me and attending to it, than other people's thoughts about me. I also realised i can't assume others are thinking negatively about me, it feels real but i can't be sure its true.  Even if they were, these aren't the kind of people whose opinions i care about.  

**RAIN by Tara Brach.**

Explanation:  This is a meditation but i use it mostly for in the moment.  

R - Recognise whats going on.  What is happening inside me right now.

A - Allow the experience to be there.  Allowing means letting the thoughts or sensations to be there without trying to fix or avoid.  I usually say, yes, its here, its ok.

I - Investigate.  How does thing feel in body right now?  What am i believing?  What does this vulnerable place need?

N - Nurture.  Nurture with self- compassion.  I'm listening and i care.I'm sorry you're going through this. Who are you when you aren't caught in this emotion?

An example.  When i'm attracted to someone, i freeze around them.  I recognise i'm freezing and feeling anxious.  I allow it to be there, saying to myself its here, its ok.  Then, i investigate.  What it happening in my body?  Jumpiness, rigidity, chaos of thoughts.I'm believing i'm weird.  I feel shame. What does this place need?  To know i'm good enough, to be calmed and recognise that this is hard. Nurture - i tell myself this is hard and i care about the suffering, i don't have to believe the story of not good enough / weird.  

In addition, I've made lifestyle changes. I go to bed earlier, do slow yin yoga, go swimming, rarely have caffeine, use kettle bells and have hobbies i enjoy.  I eat whole food, every 3-4 hours, as it lowers cortisol.  I also use a shiatsu hand-held electric massager, as it relaxes the anxiety-induced tension, daily. 

I have a very scared and ashamed part of me and believe self-compassion, mindfulness and looking after my body are keys to looking after it.

I hope this helps someone.  Sorry it was a bit long.",2024-11-10 12:34:17

Recently I had a health scare where I was driving on the highway (which I rarely do) and all of a sudden got this feeling where my stomach drops, my grip loosens, and my limbs go limp. Obvs this is terrifying to experience when you're hurling down the road going 90+, so i pulled over.

From there it just got worse and worse, what i thought was low blood sugar did not go away after drinking a soda, instead my limp muscles + fatigue turned into uncontrollable shaking. 

Shaking is a light word, i think the term convulsing or even seizing would be a better descriptor. I'm sitting there hunched over completely unable to pull myself up because my entire body was shaking so hard that i was vibrating the seat, jaw clenched, neck shaking so hard that i was concerned i would pass out. waves of nausea kept coming and i had to mentally coach myself through each breath, otherwise i wouldve stopped breathing entirely.

this lasted about an hour until i got to the ER. bloodwork came back clean, normal glucose levels, normal pulse. now i'm wondering if it could be panic/anxiety symptoms? because i have no clue what else it could be unless i have some other bodily health disorder and should keep investigating",2024-11-11 08:34:55

Anxiety,1gohxs0,Cannot stop worrying about a specific situation,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gohxs0/cannot_stop_worrying_about_a_specific_situation/,0,"Friday I found there is some issue with my health insurance that could be a nightmare to fix, I pray it’s not. I don’t want to get into it, but computer glitches and paperwork problems are a HUGE trigger for me.

My anxiety has been sky high for 3 days now, on top of baseline anxiety. I cannot get a therapist right now because this issue is insurance related so I have been calling crisis lines and warmlines. Talking to them has been very helpful.

I had a similar anxiety nightmare from a DMV paperwork problem many years ago. I know these things take time and phonecalls but having this anxiety roller coaster on top makes everything worse.

I’m trying breathing exercises, ground techniques, long walks, and that can help me slowly bring my anxiety level from an 8 down below 5. Sometimes I get relief where the anxiety is just gone for an hour. Then it returns again: worry, ruminating, catastrophizing.

I want to learn more about somatic movement. But open to any other ideas from anyone who can relate to my post.

Sorry if this isn't the place for this question but I didn't really know where else to post it.

I'm 16 and have big changes coming in my life soon. I'm starting a new apprenticeship and am moving out - I'm moving 3 and half hours Away. At the same time as this, both of my parents are moving back to where they grew up. (they're divorced) so I've got a lot of stuff going on right now.

I've recently have had my first taste of anxiety and stress and it's been absolutely crushing me. I'm getting palpitations and my arms go tingly/a bit numb when it's quite bad. I've been to the doctor's, she listened to my heart and said it sounds fine, I've also had an ECG (waiting for the results). I've just been so worried that it's something other than the effects of anxiety, mainly thinking I'm going to have heart attack or something along the lines of that. Both of my parents are saying that anxiety effects everyone in different ways which is somewhat reassuring but it feels like a vicious loop of worry and an increasing amount of anxiety. When I'm laying in bed at night my mind races thinking, what if it is something else? 

My parents have also said that the big changes coming definitely contribute towards this anxiety, which I agree with them but my health worries have been the main source I feel.

Just want someone's thoughts on this is all.

Thank you 🙏

Edit: also forgot to add that I get random pains sometimes? they can be anywhere in my body but are mainly around my chest area. don't know if they're caused by the anxiety though... ",2024-11-11 00:21:27

I (24f) started Propranolol last week for some symptoms that started two weeks ago. My symptoms that made them prescribe the medication were tachycardia (specifically when standing/walking around) and chest pains. My labeled dose is a 10mg tablet twice a day but my doctor said I could do 5mg twice a day to see how that works for me and in all honesty, it's working magnificently.

I don't know if this medication at this low of a dose is purely placebo or if it's actually doing the job. I have horrific health anxiety (during my first onset of symptoms, I ended up in the ER 4 times thinking I was about to keel over from a heart attack) and I've had lots of good days when I started it but also some bad days. My chest pain still comes and goes after walking around quite a bit (especially after a 10 hour shift) but otherwise my heartrate has been pretty normal.

I trained myself to not obsessively look at my heart rate on my apple watch and it's definitely helped but that fear is still lingering in the back of my mind. Is this medication purely placebo at this dose? If anyone else is on this low of a dose, does it help you as well? I'm new to these medications so I'm in the blue, even after going to Dr. Google about it.

side note, I also have asthma (was worse in my childhood years but I still use my inhaler once or twice a month) and I also vape on the daily. After reading about it, it sounds like people have had it worsen it? If so, how bad? I've had mild coughing fits since starting the meds but nothing too horrible.",2024-11-11 04:59:48

To working about maybe a class in some cases years in advance (Like me worrying when starting college in the late 2010s for a internship I did not have to do until the early 2020s).

Anxiety,1go49xv,Journal Prompts for Anxiety,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1go49xv/journal_prompts_for_anxiety/,3,"Between last night and this morning I've felt quite a bit of anxiety and am not sure why (I have a good feeling it's healthy anxiety). I decided to journal about it and I asked ChatGPT to give me some journaling prompts. I was thoroughly impressed by the output and hope they may help others as they have helped me:

\---

Here are some journaling prompts specifically tailored for moments when you feel anxiety without a clear reason. These prompts are designed to help you explore your feelings, uncover hidden triggers, and process your emotions in a productive way:



\### 1. \*\*Mind-Body Connection Check-In\*\*

\- ""What physical sensations am I experiencing right now, and how do they make me feel emotionally?""

\- ""If my body could speak, what would it be trying to tell me?""



This prompt helps you tune into your body, which can often hold tension or discomfort that manifests as anxiety.



\### 2. \*\*Naming the Unknown\*\*

\- ""If I had to guess, what might my anxiety be trying to protect me from right now?""

\- ""What is something I’ve been avoiding thinking about or addressing lately?""



This prompt helps give a name or shape to vague fears or concerns.



\### 3. \*\*Safe Space Visualization\*\*

\- ""Close your eyes and imagine a place where you feel completely safe and at peace. Describe it in detail. How does your body feel in this place?""

\- ""How can I bring elements of this safe space into my current reality?""



This can help ground you by creating a mental escape and giving your anxiety a soothing image.



\### 4. \*\*Unspoken Thoughts\*\*

\- ""What is something I want to say out loud but feel like I can’t?""

\- ""What am I afraid might happen if I say what I truly feel?""



Anxiety often builds when we hold back thoughts or emotions we think are unacceptable.



\### 5. \*\*The ‘Why’ Ladder\*\*

\- ""What am I feeling anxious about right now? And why?""

  \- Follow up with: ""And why does that matter to me?"" Keep asking ""Why?"" until you reach a deeper understanding.



This technique can help you drill down from surface-level anxiety to the root cause.



\### 6. \*\*Self-Compassion Check-In\*\*

\- ""If I were comforting a friend feeling this exact way, what would I say to them right now?""

\- ""What would be the kindest thing I could do for myself at this moment?""



This prompt shifts the focus from self-criticism to self-compassion.



\### 7. \*\*Reframing Fears\*\*

\- ""What is the worst-case scenario I’m imagining? How realistic is it, and what could I do if it actually happened?""

\- ""What is the best-case scenario, and how would I handle that?""



This prompt helps you acknowledge fears while also considering positive or neutral outcomes.



\### 8. \*\*A Letter to My Anxiety\*\*

\- ""Write a letter to your anxiety as if it were a person. What would you say to it? What would you ask?""

\- ""How might your anxiety respond if it could write back?""",2024-11-10 16:20:29

The activities that I started doing before the trip such as music classes or streaming or gamedev all seems so daunting now that im all broken : they just stopped making sense and life lost its colors yet again

, I can't seem to control how I act or feel, all i do is cry and all i do is want to be loved. I don't understand why I'm always used and used and used and im sorry if it isn't the place to vent but everywhere I try to find comfort seems to end up hurting me so maybe at least pixels won't


I wish I was one of the pretty ones, cultivated ones, sharp ones, funny ones, sunshine ones, I used to be that, I really thought I was doing better but all my hard work just crumbled because of this stupid trip that was a gift for me, how ironic, and left an insecure loser that has to tell everyone how fun Japan was while I cried every single day there for two weeks

Yesterday for the first time, I was chilling, not anxious or stressed and it came out of no where. For me I feel numbness or tingling sensation in my upper chest which goes up to my neck along with feeling of fainting or dying. Yesterday I felt like thats it I am gonna die. 

Is this the normal sensations for panic attacks? Do any of you have a similar experience? I am a little freaked out because of this

I’m currently applying to medical school, and I’ve put so much effort into pursuing this dream. I’m sure this is the career I want, but I’ve realized I have a deep discomfort with needles—especially when it comes to self-injections. While I’m okay with someone else drawing my blood or giving me a vaccine, the idea of injecting myself, like my recent dose of Ozempic, triggered intense anxiety. I couldn’t bring myself to do it, and ended up asking my roommate to inject it for me. I realized a lot of the anxiety is coming from the fact that I HAVE to do something, as if I’m getting blood drawn by a medical professional. I’m more able to self regulate because I know they know what they’re doing.


Today was a wake-up call, and it has me worried that this fear might impact my career. I suspect it started from a bad experience at a clinic where a nurse struggled to find my vein and eventually suggested trying my hand, which felt uncomfortable and unprofessional. I’m determined to work through this and want to know if therapists specialize in needle phobias.

All of the things I buy from the store I use and save for meals throughout the week. So if we used my ingredients, I would get panicky and feel like I’m wasting money and will run out of food. The reality is that I can always buy more food, and though money is tight, I do have enough to share. But I can’t make my body believe that. I try to convince myself that it’s ok to share or tell them they can use my stuff but when I do do that I get so anxious and feel like I’m going to cry. I also start resenting them for taking my stuff even though I offered. I think I’d prefer to just keep things to myself but then I’m a hypocrite cause I take their food when they offer. I just wish I didn’t mind as much. The same thing happens at restaurants when we order food to share. I’m always worried there won’t be enough and I get so stressed paying for things I didn’t eat.

I’m so terrified of needles and any sort of procedure you might have done without sedation and I’ve had a really rough month. 2 weeks ago I sliced my finger open and needed stitches but I was flinching so bad with the lidocaine needle that they couldn’t numb me and I had to get the stitches without it. The very next day I had to have 3 moles removed and that was way better than the stitches but was still just layering trauma on top of trauma, and then the NEXT day I found out that I need to get a lump on my thyroid biopsied by Fine Needle Aspiration.

Why can’t my brain prioritize things like “this needle won’t kill you but cancer can so get the biopsy!” everything I read about it says there might be “pressure” or “discomfort” and I feel like they are being dishonest, there’s no sedation so how could it not hurt?

1. By the afternoon, my cheeks get soooo hot and I feel quite feverish. It's strange because sometimes my face gets so hot (sweaty pits too...) but everywhere else I'm cold (office temperature). Maybe cortisol levels are high? 

2. I seem to be ""deer in headlights"" or missing parts of basic instructions because I'm feeling tense (even if I look fine on the outside.

Whether food has been open too long and it's got botulism and I'll die, or if it's delivered that it's been tampered with and someone is going to poison and kill me.  I know this kind of anxiety is common among people with OCD, but I do not believe I have that nor am I diagnosed with that. I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. I also have developmental trauma, and I was made aware that I have trauma by my psychologist.

The last two weeks I was in a depressive episode (I didn't realize until my psychologist mentioned it actually, but I was incredibly down). Then, in the midst of it I had a health emergency (maybe related who knows). Now, I am coming out of it and finding myself very anxious about the sensations I feel in my body post-health-issue and the food anxiety has started again. I ordered my groceries for delivery and now I'm concerned my pack of water is poisoned and it is making me anxious. I'm thirsty, but I can't bring myself to drink it and I can't drink tap water because I ALSO think that's gonna kill me (I am a mess).

Ive been told by those close to me and by my mentors, both professors and those at my campus career education center, that im ok and that ill figured this out eventually. Im not sure i truely believe them

Shame and anxiety keep creeping back into my mind. I think of how bad i am for not coming to this this conclusion sooner. I think of how people arround me see me as a washout, falling short of their original dreams and giving up. I think of all the people i see online berating psychology as a major, saying a bachelor's is not worth the paper its printed on. 

I go through times of hope where I feel like I like things might work out for me but then doubt creeps back in and i spiral back down to where I am now. I want figure out my life path but it seems like the world is screaming at me that ill fail. I want to succeed but I feel like such a failure.

Background info if needed: I'm a 22 yr old male with quite a few mental illnesses, main ones being ADHD, Mood Disorder, Anger issues, and Anxiety... the best part? (this is sarcasm btw) I'm uneducated for EVERYTHING, been so for basically all my life.

I work in a cereal factory and do 12h every day I clock in (also swing shifts too WOOOO /s), I usually get 2 days off or 3 days when transitioning from day to night

They sat me down, talked to me, and drove me home (which wasn't at all what I was expecting), so I'm now just wondering

what can I do to prevent this in the future and how to stop it when I feel it creeping up on me

My head is quiet, I can sleep, I am positive, hopeful and accepting of life in general.

Well this friend, who had never been to therapy or anything started judging me and treating me like an addict, saying I was wrecking my therapy goals, which he doesn't even know about and that I shouldn't be depending on any substances at all. For whose, who don't know, CBD is not addictive and not psychoactive. It relaxes on a physiological level. He started trashing me and saying I needed to go to psychiatry and get real meds, if I feel bad and that's only on the doctor to decide and how dare I ""self-medicate"". - This is coming from a person, who drinks alcohol every day and doesn't function without it.

But he isn't there when I can't sleep, because I think I will die or my loved ones will die or anything will go to hell or when I am at my worst. But as soon as I take something with no side effects for me, that doesn't even damage by body, but is actually beneficial in a lot of ways (anti-inflammatory, for example), he feels free to make me cry and judge me like this. 

I don't want to see him again... I hate that people can both treat you badly for having a mental illness and then for taking something that makes me feel better I get judged, too. And this from the first person who would do hard and bad drugs, only for the thrill of it.

Anxiety,1gogxuj,"Working in a factory with Anxiety, need help",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gogxuj/working_in_a_factory_with_anxiety_need_help/,0,"Hey, so I decided after having a panic attack and basically forced to clock out (reasonable, but dang, lost hours), I'd come in here to ask for advice, either general, or work-related as to not have this happen, been at this job for 3 weeks and I really don't want to lose this job

Background info if needed: I'm a 22 yr old male with quite a few mental illnesses, main ones being ADHD, Mood Disorder, Anger issues, and Anxiety... the best part? (this is sarcasm btw) I'm uneducated for EVERYTHING, been so for basically all my life.

I work in a cereal factory and do 12h every day I clock in (also swing shifts too WOOOO /s), I usually get 2 days off or 3 days when transitioning from day to night

What happened: So I'm on the line (or as we call it, Stack-Off, which is basically stacking boxes onto pallets, but the conveyer got a tad bit too busy for comfort and as I was stacking, I tried to go as fast as I could (this is a problem with me, and I need to just... cease trying to get shit done asap), well, few minutes later I was hyperventilating and getting easily frustrated over the simplest of things (like boxes not being taped and product flinging everywhere whenever I took it off the conveyer), one thing lead to another and collapsed, trying to regain my breath, trying to figure out what just happened, and most of all, trying to figure out how to word this to not lose my job

They sat me down, talked to me, and drove me home (which wasn't at all what I was expecting), so I'm now just wondering

what can I do to prevent this in the future and how to stop it when I feel it creeping up on me

TLDR: I work in a factory and had a panic attack (I think that's what it was) and was sent home early, now in need of advice to halt whatever I just had while at work",2024-11-11 01:46:54
Anxiety,1gogxi9,Multiple problems 😪 ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gogxi9/multiple_problems/,0,"Ah well I have been thru a lot lately. 
Me and fiancé split in May after him not inviting me to his b day and then found him on fb dating. He blamed it all on me. Kinda messed me up.

My best friend got upset cause I told her she should show more empathy,  think she was going thru things too but yeah, she blocked me after I told her that she's cold German.

Recently I lost online friend because I wanted space but he didn't respect it. Then I lost my marbles and sent voice messages. Poof ignored me.

Recently also lost friend cause he told me one day out of blue that his mom thinks Im using him for driving me. So he believed his mom?  He told me it is ok and I always vrought him gifts. 
He told me why is grown woman not able to drive herself?
I just blocked him because he knows I'm disabled and he knows I'm not woman, but non binary.  
He acted like I am less because I can't drive. 
I have car but I got dissociative episode on road once and since then I avoid driving on fast roads.

I feel so lonely, I couldn't tell it to him. I can't tell this to my mom. 
Everytime I tell big stuff she says she's sorry but she never kniws how to help.

I don’t have other family members that I am close to.

I know they're not my real friends but for 3 or 5 years they were and grieving is hard. I don't care about you know loosing. But the SAME AND HUMILIATION HURT. BETRAYAL.


I struggle with depression,  concentration,  low motivation,  agitation and explodive anger, self harm ( head banging) when I am in episode. 

Im not suicidal. I am in therapy. I don't need family, kids, lovers, I have gosls that are taken from me and I'm workimg my ass to get there.

But i am FRUSTRATED.  I have anger so much pain and dissociative problems and overstimulation and social anxiety.  

Going to therapy helps but with everything I STILL NEED A BREAK and I'm tired.
Tired of cleanimg, cooking, folding clothes,  surviving, smiling, pushing through,  and having unequipped mother that I resent so much. The frustration snd anger, my PTSD and autism overstimulation are so hard! 

I just want to get into some art school that's friendly for me and forget everything and everyone.  My gaslightings betraying ex, my mistakes from that relationship,  my broken heart, his contempt,  my ex friends,  laundry, dishes, my body that needs physio therapy. 
I need my life back😫 Im so messed up, while I was healthy mother never supported my dream to study art. I am and was always alone. I am tired of stigma. Why can't it be easier to get into some school without all the hassle and get visa for New Zealand and forget everything and belong to art circles? I don't need anything else. I just want to be able to feel motivation and not struggle to force myself to do anything even stuff I love.
Why can't I respawn? Shit is in my head not leaving.

For reference I am on wellbutrin and buspirone, antidepressant and anxiolitic, takomg calming pills per need. Plus gabapentine for my spine issues.
I have tried SSRI, SNRI, they made me numb, got retless leg syndrome,  serotonin syndrome and tried various antipsychotics that made me hallucinate and some made me so numb to point where I wanted to die so yeah almost nothing works.

Any help appreciated. ",2024-11-11 01:46:23

Took another one tonight and it clicked. I think that xanax messed my head up cause, yes, it removed the anxiety from yesterday but it came back like a tsunami the day after.

Anxiety,1gogjgp,Wife's Anxiety is Difficult to Absorb,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gogjgp/wifes_anxiety_is_difficult_to_absorb/,0,"Wife is early 30s and I am late 30s. We have been married for 6 years. I also struggle with anxiety, but it is just less debilitating than hers. We are both late bloomers in life, so I have tried to be patient with her but her anxiety has gotten to a severe state imo. She is very uncomfortable shopping alone or going almost anywhere alone that involves her leaving the car. 

I have been able to deal with those things for the past 3-4 years, but my sanity has hit a breaking point since she left her most recent job over her anxiety because she felt she was the worst worker there and had little privacy (she worked there for 3 weeks). She has a history of getting fed up with jobs and leaving before getting another job lined up and then she procrastinates on getting a new one due to her social anxiety. Her dream is to work from home and work for herself but I have doubts about that happening since she can't ensure interviewing much.
  
I am a bit sympathetic to her struggles, but at the same time, I just worry I am enabling her like a parent would. She hasn't embraced adulthood like I expected at her age and it is difficult to get her to follow through on things as she tends to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. 
  
I have strongly urged her to try therapy again, but she has had a bad experience with it. I even offered to go with her for the first few sessions (yes it would be a hit to our HSA but it would be worth it imo). She is also reluctant to go on any meds as the last ones she tried didn't help (I tried to explain she needs to try more than just 1). She will work for maybe 8 months to a year and then burn out. Quit. Take a break for however long she wants, until it hits a boiling point.
  
I have tried putting my foot down in the past about her not working or going to to therapy but it just has led to her threatening to go live with her dad for a while, or she accuses me of wanting a divorce. It is exhausting tbh. She often repeats that she would rather be dead than have to work the rest of her life (yes, I explained how unfair that is to me to have to hold the fort down financially and I am done explaining it to her. I want to be able to save more and pay down the house sooner than later)
  
She believes her disorders make it difficult for her to consistently work and that I should be more supportive at times. It has left me a bit resentful but I think getting her to at least therapy and on some meds could help her get past this. 

Sorry for the long post and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this novel.

TLDR: Wife's anxiety is preventing her from doing everyday adult things like working and it is straining our marriage. Any advice here would be helpful.",2024-11-11 01:25:59

Anxiety,1gog6ph,Is this anxiety ?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gog6ph/is_this_anxiety/,1,"Hello all, 
A little bit of background: 24 years old, 165ib.

I'm at a lost for what's going in my body. I've been to almost every medical professional,  and it's all the same story: everything comes back normal and I'm fine.

Long story short, my heart seems to become tachycardiac randomly. Most of the time, honestly, almost all of the time, it happens when it starts to become night. About two to three weeks ago, I went to the ER because my heart rate was in the 120s-130s and would not calm down. They have me a dose of hydroxyzine and it still didn't do anything. Then they gave me metoprolol and it calmed right now. Since then I've been taking metoprolol, the beta blocker. Honestly, it's been a blessing too, because I don't get pvcs as much anymore--- unless my heart is racing. It also lowered my heart to a 65 which felt so amazing. Before that, it was always elevated, my normal was around 90 resting.  During that ER setting, all results came back normal. Normal xray. Normal blood panel. Normal EKG. Just tachycardia. I'm relieved obviously. But still, just frustrated why so randomly this happens. 

Last night, my heart rate was above 100 again, and I went to the ER. They literally know me by name now. Once again, everything came back normal and I'm completely fine. 

Now tonight, my heart is slightly taking off, but I just took some hydroxyzine in hopes of calming it down. I don't want to test my heart rate ATM. 

Ive been trying to heal and get past a lot of things, but this heart thing is really bothering me. Im so tired of feeling on edge when my heart just takes off like it has been. My cardiologist said that because it's just tachycardia,  it's pointing away from it being anything to do with the heart, given back all the results.  

I'm glad my heart is structurally fine. I'm just feeling so trapped, I feel like it's ruining my life-- and it is to be honest. 

When it happens, I'm literally doing nothing anxiety provoking. There were times I could be having fun with friends and BOOM. There is goes.   I know it starts to happen because of a weird stressing feeling in the lower middle of chest-- it's like a nervous feeling. 

... is that anxiety? I mean, I just can't believe it would pop out of no where, without any trigger. This last for like hours, tbh. I thought anxiety was just a, you feel it for 30 minutes at most, but otherwise,  it slowly fades away-- not a constant thing of every second. 

I'm feeling so trapped, and I hate going to the ER around 3-4 times a month. I just want to live my life and not have to worry about all of this. .... I don't know what to do at this point. I'm so tired of all of this, and I've honestly been feeling like I'm about to croak anytime due to how uncomfortable these feelings are. 

Please help. As much as you can. ",2024-11-11 01:07:29

I know that the sides all come back around when you increase dose. But OMFG how I am exhausted. I have hit all the side effects of an SSRI onboarding - tummy yuck, nausea and anorexia, headaches, just buzzing nervous system, derealization, the fucking insomnia! 

Now at the start of 4th week, they seem to all dissipate, only to be replaced by feeling like absolute shit most of the time. My anxiety and OCD have been, thankfully, lessened and apparently that just makes way for crying spells. I'm trying to be very strong for my 2 kids who are little, and my partner who doesn't relate although tries to be supportive, but I'm just so exhausted of fighting this uphill battle daily and just not knowing who I even am anymore.

Did an EKG during the episode and it was ok, then blood tests, then thyroid test, then echocardiogram, 24h monitor, all perfectly fine. So I was told it’s probably stress/anxiety. That was in the end o September and I’ve just had 2 or 3 more episodes since then and was able to control it either with the propanolol 10mg they gave me or just with breathing. I’m only 20 and don’t have a disease history in my family so I’m probably ok. The symptoms have pretty much gone away lately, some days they happen but I’ve been able to control. But now I felt dizzy/fainty/lightheaded a few times in the past days and I got so worried and thought maybe I should go to the doctor and try to get brain tests.

I can feel it in my chest and it won't leave no matter how much I rest. I'm too sensitive for medication, so I try to handle it on my own.

I put in a 2 weeks notice at my job because I was starting a new job. I was going to take 2 weeks off (got married) and my new job was okay with this. Fast forward to 3 days before I start and they told me I was replaced and didn't even remember my actual start date.. so now I've been searching for a new job and it hasn't been easy due to scheduling issues with childcare. My living situation just makes things worse. My husband and I are long distance for now, it's just so bad. I'm dissociating daily.

I have a job interview, I think? Because it's been hard to talk to these people. Been speaking to them off and on for 2 weeks. The interview is in 2 days and I'm dreading it. I am about to skip it. I have a horrible feeling about it and I am just debating on saying screw it. The thought of it makes me so anxious. 

I literally only have enough energy to care for myself and my child. I speak to my husband and that recharges my internal battery.. But everything else is exhausting. I have PTSD and obviously haven't been caring for my mental health if I'm this burnt out. Like wth is even happening 

Last weekend I even took my child to a birthday party, we were there for 3 hours and I just needed to go home and take a nap. I had a headache and felt exhausted from just socializing. It's so bad",2024-11-10 19:36:29

I struggle to get through work and am debating on moving to a different state to start life over. A new start is mandatory at the moment, but trying to figure out if it’s something I want to do is kind of tough. I have some family here but nobody is really supportive.  My mom is going to rehab next week so I will truly be alone here.  I guess I’m just venting, but just struggling to keep it together mentally while dealing with work/financial/housing/loneliness issues feels like too much. I truly do feel like moving to a different state might help me and just starting completely fresh.  

My anxiety attacks are pretty bad, but I’ve been managing to keep them at bay.  Before, a panic attack would have me going to the hospital, even calling an ambulance once or twice, but hydroxyzine and coping skills are keeping me stable, kind of? I’m just sick of dealing with this and it’s keeping me from actually living life.

About 3-4 weeks ago, I had this awful feeling behind my sternum that was immediately followed by the sensation that my heart stopped for a second, and then sped up to about 150 bpm. I got checked out by multiple docs who did EKGs, an x-ray, and a few rounds of blood work, but nothing really turned up. I just finished a 14-day holder monitor and am waiting on results from that, but I don't really believe it's my heart (even though it feels like it). I'm highly suspicious of it being GI related, as I do have a history of significant GERD, but my GI doesn't think it's the culprit either, and everyone just points their finger at anxiety. 

I've hit the point where I hardly get out of bed because I'm worried about that feeling happening again (it's happened several times since the first time) and I know that's terrible for me, but I feel stuck and don't know how to fix it. I've been seeing a therapist but its yielded little so far, and I was prescribed an SSRI but I've been scared to start taking it because of all the terrible side effect stories you see on here. I understand at this point taking the meds might be my last resort, but I can't seem to get over this mental block that preventing me from doing it. The only other notable thing I learned recently is that I've been slightly deficient in potassium for the last 2 years, and that may be due to the PPI I'm on for GERD, but my doc can't think of anything else that would do that so he's having me worked up by a renal doc even though my kidney function has always been fine. 

I realize this is a lot of rambling/ranting, but any other experiences or insight would be appreciated, because I'm not sure how I'm supposed to beat this and be able to live my life again. ",2024-11-10 22:22:05

I love her so much and I just want the best for her and to be able to make her own choices of course but I can’t help but worry A LOT about her. She used to drink like 1-2 energy drinks a day and now she definitely has improved that in terms of not drinking energy drinks every day but there are not many days where she hasn’t drank either energy drink, soda, or coffee (she only drinks white coffee). That is like rare. Usually most of the days it’s either her white coffee drink she gets from Dutch bros or an energy drink (Red Bull, Yerba mates, Dutch bros/ or Starbucks). Idk if I’m over worrying this and maybe it’s something to not really be concerned about. I think it’s also the fact that she has other conditions and experiences symptoms on a daily (frequent episodes of shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, fatigue/tirsd etc). Even when she does drink an energy drink or something with caffeine it doesn’t really improve her fatigue or energy levels that much anyways. She has drank an energy drink and fell asleep before. She sometimes drinks matcha and she says she is trying to get into drinking matcha but I don’t see much change for that. She also has a pretty seredetery lifestyle. I am not trying to “attack” or judge her in anyway. This is just me worried about her and I love her so much. My greatest fear is losing her.

Take dizziness for example. Usually during my anxiety- or panic bouts I experience this sensation that I can only describe as dizziness or lightheadedness, but I'm not *actually* dizzy or lightheaded. I'm just perceiving this sensation as dizziness. Like my nervous system is just firing blanks in its hyper-alert state and I end up with this placeholder-symptom that's not actually real.

Same with shortness of breath. I never actually experience any trouble breathing or anything, but I get this weird sensation that my body perceives as shortness of breath even though it's not actually there. It's so weird and so exhausting. The worst part is that these symptoms always scare the bejesus out of me, even though they never hinder my physical functionality in any way like the real symptoms would.

The doctors thing is something I was thinking of posting/seeking advice/help on last night, the coffee thing is like a rn thing loll

Coffee first. I’m a senior in highschool, two years ago was first time I started drinking soda, not for caffeine purposes but sometimes rarely yes for the caffeine. Then since start of this year idk why it’s just been horrible. Usually I’m wide awake all the time but the start of this year I’ve been having a hard time focusing and frickin idk what’s wrong with me. I’ve gone from rarely sleeping to now I can hardly get through the school day without sleeping in at least one class. So I’ve tried drinking coffee a few times, I don’t really like the taste but I though screw it it can help. It never helped, Starbucks, etc. I’d drink pumpkin spice lattes (because I’m basic lol) and i really didn’t feel anything lmao so I thought “oh coffee sucks, tastes bad and doesn’t help”. Today I was again having trouble with focus and I have school crap to do that I haven’t been doing. I was also feeling kinda sad ngl, I went to the gas station thinking of trying cigarettes or whatever (I know very fucking stupid I’m not gonna do that), realized I can’t buy cigarettes got coffee instead not thinking much about it. HOLY SHIT. Idk why but this shit is like so fucking strong, I didn’t even drink all of it. My fingers are shaking, my heart is beating, and now I can’t focus because instead of wanting to stay in bed and like disappear now I feel like I’m going to have a fucking heart attack good fucking lord lmaoo. I hate this, wtf is in gas station coffee. Idk if this is anxiety I just didn’t know where to post this lol, okay now to the second part which is genuinely anxiety.

Doctors. I just turned 18, I have not been to the doctor since I was like 10. I always hated going to the doctor as a kid, always was nervous and anxious to go y’know? And when I was around 10 my doctor was arrested (for things they did to other patients, they didnt do anything to me) and since I dont really have medical issues and was always scared of the doctor I didn’t really ever ask to go, but I realize that im pretty sure most kids go like every year or more (maybe my friends just get sick a lot idk). Anyway last night my mom just sprang on me that I need to get a physical exam soon and it’s been really freaking me out (even before the coffee lol) like idk, I never liked going to the doctor and basically I know you should go so in my head I was planning to go to my first doctor visit after graduating college and dragging a friend or something so I would be less nervous or something idk. I just, I don’t wanna go but I know that’s also fucking childish as shit. Idk im just scared of doctors because of several reasons. 1, im scared of like being told “hey bro you’re weird, why tf do you do that it’ll kill you” 2, wow you’re really unhealthy or like overweight, shame on you 3, there’s nothing wrong with you or you’re overreacting to shit stfu.
Idk how doctor visits are even like y’know, I haven’t been in basically a decade. I’ve also never gotten blood drawn and that seems scary as heck too but I know I probably should. I don’t even know who my doctor technically is rn lmao idk the whole thing scares me but I also feel like “hey man you’re an adult this shit shouldn’t fucking bother you, what are you ten?” But then I counter that with “well I haven’t been since I was like ten so I might as well be at that fuckin point” idk, how do people go to the doctor. Im not like dying (I don’t think) so why do I need to go? Idk how do I deal with this anxiety. One answer im not gonna drink coffee from a gas station again lmao.",2024-11-10 21:39:10
Anxiety,1gobo74,Buspirone effectiveness?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gobo74/buspirone_effectiveness/,1,"30M who has dealt with severe anxiety / MDD since I was about 14. I have a PhD, and am working in (what should be) a low stress, great paying job since, but I have lived so long with my anxiety that I cannot turn off the constant worrying, constant sinking feeling, pit in my stomach, crying in fear of getting fired / messing up / etc. I always assumed once school stopped I would relax, but I have tried therapy for years and it provided minimal relief, and feel that I am still in the same position. I have always been weary of medication (specifically SSRI’s) but I feel that I am at the end of my rope with options and will try anything at this point to feel relief. 

My doctor recommended buspirone (10mg twice daily) and it has been 2 weeks and I don’t feel different. Maybe it’s my expectations or not knowing how “normal” feels, but how do I know these meds are working or not? I cannot fathom how these meds are supposed to make me think differently or feel less stressed when I can’t remember a time in my life where I wasn’t. 

 For people who are on this med or other anti-anxiety meds, how did you know the meds you were on were the right choice and worked? Has anyone who dealt with long term anxiety feel that their anxiety is gone? Thank you ",2024-11-10 21:38:21
Anxiety,1gobl1r,Constructive criticism in relationships ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gobl1r/constructive_criticism_in_relationships/,0,"I hope this is a post that falls in the anxiety category. 

I know better than anyone that relationships are mirrors, and that your significant other is more often than not going to reflect your unfavorable qualities back to you which in turn helps us become aware of them.

I have struggled with receiving constructive criticism for most of my life. Recently I have been consciously trying to work on this by trying to modify this while at work. I know that receiving constructive criticism at work is only to help me be better at my job, so it should be the same in my relationships. 

While spending time with my significant other this weekend, I started becoming painfully aware of this poor quality I have as well as my unfavorable quality of talking over people or making something they share immediately about me by trying to relate, which can be damaging in communication within relationships. 

I really want to modify this behavior as it brings up a lot of anxiety and fear-based abandonment issues in previous relationships where previous partners or friends have shared they find it hard to communicate criticisms to me without fear of me responding poorly via getting emotional and upset, freezing up, and becoming silent when I’m normally talkative with my SO as he is 100% my best friend. 

To clarify, he’s very patient and supportive and I’ve been trying to be better at least about communicating that I’ve been ruminating on all of these poor qualities of mine and honestly wondering why he loves me at all. I know nobody is perfect and that we all have unfavorable traits and qualities that contribute to the beautiful wholeness of who we are, but this is something I’d really like to change. 

If anyone has helpful tips I’m very open to hearing anything helpful. 
Not that this matters a whole lot, but I also work in mental health and have been in therapy for many years seeing the same therapist for 7+ years. 
I have all the right tools to work on this but I’m not really sure what to implement moving forward to actually see change in this space. 

This is something I’d definitely benefit from bringing up to my therapist that I’d like to work on but I want to actually make impactful change on this. 
I have so much fear + anxiety about losing him thinking one day it won’t just be something he can deal with anymore because I won’t change. 

I pride myself on my self-awareness and he agrees that starting with being aware of it is a good place. I feel like this is just the beginning of the process of changing these habits, inclusive of uncomfortable growing pains, which comes with confronting our unfavorable behaviors or qualities.

But I am still questioning whether it is or not. I hear most people talk about anxiety being ruminating thoughts and anxious about certain things. Mine seems to be different. I get these bouts of extreme dizziness and out of it feelings. Recently getting haircuts, walking in stores, driving, and even being around my friends and stuff has been causing this feeling. I get dizzy, lightheaded, and unsteady, it almost feels as if the ground is uneven (if that makes sense). Then the anxiety and ruminating starts. I have been prescribed Zoloft but have only ever taken up to 37.5mg daily and have been on that for over 4 years, cause I’m afraid of it making me feel worse. I know that that does is obviously not enough and am going to actually try and stick to upping the dosage. I’m not really sure what I am looking for in an answer, but I’m so confused on if this is even anxiety. I have had heart work ups, labs, sleep studies,ect and everything is fine so it has to be, but it seems so different from everyone else’s anxiety.

Anxiety,1goaubf,We are all tired of this anxiety. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1goaubf/we_are_all_tired_of_this_anxiety/,0,"I’m tired of this anxiety. Feeling weird symptoms, having to go to bed extra early just to try and fall asleep to get the symptoms to go away. Having to try different medicine to help with it. Stomach issues, physical symptoms and feeling dizzy the days after.. 

I’ve been suffering for a couple years now. The first year I went to the ER 4 times just to be told nothing is wrong… the second year I went 3 times until the very last time I went a doctor finally told me she thinks I have anxiety and prescribed me hydroxyzine to take when I felt the symptoms pop up. That helped a bit. Knowing I wasn’t actually dying yet. These weird symptoms weren’t a heart attack like google was saying it might be. I’m tired of having to suddenly cancel things because I’m feeling dizzy and don’t feel comfortable driving like that. Tired of family and people not really understanding what’s going on. Tired of feeling like less of a man because of this stupid anxiety that seems to happen for no reason and knock me on my ass for the next day or four. 

I think it all started for me some time after my mom passed and my dad re married. Having to then shortly after finish school on my own (was homeschooled…) and then find a job and move out. After finding out this was anxiety I managed to change my diet. A carnivore diet worked for me but I think it was mostly cutting out the sugar and caffeine and then nicotine. I lost weight and felt great but then my dog who was my mother’s dog had to be put down. She lived a very long and great life for her breed but after that I went back to my old habits. Eating junk food. Energy drinks and coffee. Vaping again… and what do you know all my anxiety and symptoms have come back even bigger and harder than ever. 

If you read this then thank you, it’s long but it feels better to rant to people who might understand. I’m going to be trying to beat this again. I know it’s possible, I’ve done it once. If you guys have anything that helps you please share below. Especially any natural or over the counter things that seem to help you. For me hot showers whenever I feel something starting up and alka seltzer plus cold/flu helps me (not recommending you take it though it just seems to help me. ) what helps you guys?

They often seem intertwined and mutually reinforcing. For instance, when someone invites me out, I feel so emotionally exhausted that I decline. Is this due to depression sapping my energy, or is it anxiety holding me back?

Being alone for extended periods exacerbates my feelings of sadness and worthlessness. This, in turn, fuels my anxiety as I fear dying alone due to my reluctance to socialize. It's a vicious cycle, and I'm worried I'm making things worse by avoiding social situations.

Then again, I have no energy to go out. And the cycle continues.

Anxiety,1gnzv1q,How can I learn to be kind to myself?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnzv1q/how_can_i_learn_to_be_kind_to_myself/,2,"Background on me: I'm a 31 (m), and have suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember. My friends and family would all describe me as very sensitive, and I would too. I am prone to over-thinking (as much as I don't like this term), catastrophising, hanging up on the past and worrying about the future. All of your text book anxiety stuff.

I have gone through a bit of a ""mental wobble"" recently, where I have started having panic attacks in work. When I'm not in work, I'm constantly worrying about it and this results in me shutting down and doing very little during my time away from the office. I would add that I work a very mentally exhausting job. I am also undertaking my Masters, while being in full-time employment.

I've been transparent with my boss and loved ones about my issues, and I've had nothing but support. I even told my university tutor, who was also very compassionate. Everyone unanimously says to me something similar - ""you're so hard on yourself"", ""I've never known anyone be as hard on themselves as you are"", ""you are overly self critical and don't need to be"", ""you need to learn to be more kind to yourself""

I've been granted a week off this week for my birthday (my boss urged me take the full week and said I deserved the down-time to do something nice, which was great!). I think, for the first time, as I reflect on my recent state, I really am just so harsh with myself. If I caught a friend talking to me the way I talk to me, I wouldn't want to be friends with them. I am exploring therapy from next week, but I'd really appreciate any tools and tips anyone has. Or at the least, to know it's not just me.",2024-11-10 12:44:26

Anxiety,1go8ew8,My girlfriend has GAD and social anxiety disorder. I feel like I'm in a one sided long distance relationship even though we live in the same city. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1go8ew8/my_girlfriend_has_gad_and_social_anxiety_disorder/,0,"For background: I am 23 she is 20, this is both of our first relationship. We met almost a year ago and have been together for around 9 months officially. We share many common interests, she is smart, pretty and all around a lovely person. On paper she is perfect, I really enjoy her company and love her to death.

However recently I have been feeling miserable because we barely get to meet each other. I have to say that it wasn't easy in the start either, as she would not initiate anything, leading to lots of confusion on my part about if she liked me or not. I was the one to start *almost* every chat, plan all our dates. Eventually I asked her directly and she told me about her anxieties and was able to assure me that she liked me. We made things official and for a long time I felt like we were moving in the right direction. For months it was meeting up one to three times in a week and we had a blast each time. I felt loved even though I was still the one initiating contact most of the time. 

Fast forward to today and she is feeling really stressed out by school, exams and driving school. I haven't had one on one time in person with her in over a month and can't remember the last time she sent me a message first. Last time I saw her was a couple weeks ago at a halloween party she threw together with her best friend. We manage to play videogames on discord once a week if lucky and have had a couple long whatsapp chats last week. 

Call me a whiny bitch but it feels really bad to be the only one to try to initate contact only to get shot down 90% of the time. For the last two months it's been an endless cycle of me trying to initiate contact with her and her being too anxious. Then me assuring that it is okay, we will get to meet when you are feeling better. But the next week she is feeling as or even more stressed out and we still can't meet. This make me initiate less and less in fear of causing more sress and anxiety to her and also because the endless rejections are just starting to feel really bad.  I try to be supportive but it's difficult when se really does not tell me about how she if feeling and the only way I know what is happening in her life is by trying to ask her.

I feel like over time she has gotten used to me initiating and has completely stopped trying. Or that's the way it feels to me but it might also be that she still feels anxious about reaching out to me. Sometimes for example she might bring up a funny meme in person that she wanted to send to me but just could not send. I try to make this easy for her by but to no avail. This has been the case for a while now, even before the really bad stress of last few months, But I realized it only just now.

I also fully realize that she is feeling even more miserable than I am. But the thing is, I don't have experience in anxieties like hers, so I don't really know how to help. I just try to be understanding and leave her space. Text her every couple of days to gauge how she is feeling and suggest activities with a low barrier of entry.  But I'm sure I have made mistakes too and maybe at some points I might have come across as pushy, so I have tried to change my mentality to just waiting it out and hope it gets better for her. For the last month I have really wanted to talk to her about this but there just has been no opportunity because of her withdrawing completely. I also fear bringing this up because I'm afraid she is just going to feel more stressed out knowing how I feel.

Last week I saw glimmers of hope. This period of school has fewer courses and she is getting more comfortable at the driving school. I think it might be slowly getting better for her as we have had some quality chats on whatsapp again. At it's worst it was just impossible to even have a texting conversation with her because her responses were just really short and had nothing to continue the conversation to with. We even managed to make plans for this week but I had to cancel because I got sick and we rescheduled for next weekend. Luckily she also has a best friend who is really a great person and supporting, so she doesn't have to cope with her anxieties alone, even if she does not feel comfortable talking about them with me.

Others with similiar anxieties, how would you want to be approached about stuff like this? Anyone who have been in similair situation?  Sorry this is probably terribly written.",2024-11-10 19:18:14

there is days where i feel much much better and it only goes up a little if at all none, then i notice when i have anxiety attacks it races the very next day followed by slowly going down over the next couple of days. Everyone tells me its anxiety. I’ve gone to two cardiologist, Seen my PCP multiple times, talked to my therapist about it, and also seen two psychologist about it as well. Oh, also i’ve been to a Urgent care and been to the hospital about four-five times already because i’ve been so scared of the racing heart accompanied by my left arm pain as well as just my whole left body just hurting. 
my heart rate is now considered
“normal” when i’m sitting or laying down 
70-90
but when i stand up it shoots to 120-130. 
The mornings for me are the worst, just by sitting up it went to 120, standing up in the mornings can go to 150. Has anyone else experienced this?? i’ve already ruled out POTS my blood pressure is normal. 
Any help?? i hate feeling alone in this.

Anxiety,1go22bs,Update 11/10/24 - Demons 👿👿👿👿,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1go22bs/update_111024_demons/,0,"I’m coming to understand more and more that anxiety itself is what shifts my perspective, making me view life through lenses that constantly scan for threats to my survival  
  
whether those threats are in the present, the future, or within my own body. Physical symptoms only reinforce this perception, and even when I feel good, there’s often a lingering discomfort, as if I’m somehow ignoring a danger.

Connecting with people or making plans feels challenging; I find myself just wanting to stay safe and calm.   
Yet, I believe that part of overcoming anxiety is actively seeking pleasure and allowing myself to enjoy it  
  
finding moments of mental or physical enjoyment rather than trying to avoid every possible threat.   
It’s hard at first, but I think once this becomes a habit, it starts to feel more natural, though I know it’s easy to slip back into the anxious cycle, especially when symptoms flare up.

Recently, I reduced my sertraline from 100 to 50, and I’ve seen how quickly I can fall back into the cycle and how challenging it is to break out of it on sheer willpower. I’ve read and heard that we can choose how we feel, but honestly, I don’t believe we can fully choose our feelings. However, I do think we can feed or starve those feelings by how we respond.

From what I’ve experienced, some of the biggest triggers for anxiety are:

*  fear (feeling that our life is in danger)
*  guilt (feeling that we are worthless)
*  shame (feeling that we can be expelled from the group)
*  repression (repression goes unnoticed but is very present)

We often see these as overwhelming forces, but really, they’re just small “devils” that threaten us, whether social or physical. We need to start seeing them for what they are—no bigger than a character like Jiminy Cricket. If we give them too much power, they’ll paralyze us. 

I think the counterforces to these “little devils” are curiosity, pleasure, freedom, and joy.  
It seems to me that when we chase that, the little devils calm down.

But fighting the little demons only brings resistance from them, we have to let them advise us, if we give them too much importance they can convince us that what they are telling us is fatal.",2024-11-10 14:39:19

No family history no preexisting condition... Just died. Not long after I ended up getting COVID and I feel like I'm constantly sick. Even now I have slight lightheadedness that won't go away. (It's so slight that I think I'm just making it up) I've been to the doctors and had a microsuction in my ears but days later I'm still feeling pressure on my head. ",2024-11-10 11:42:19

Anxiety,1gng6b7,Has anyone been told all their symptoms are anxiety when you know they’re not?,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gng6b7/has_anyone_been_told_all_their_symptoms_are/,60,"I just want to vent because I’m so pissed off. 

I’ve been suffering with an array of symptoms for several months now which everyone close to me says it’s anxiety. I’ve talked to a therapist and a mental health nurse who BOTH said they’ve never heard of someone having my symptoms (which I experience 24/7) that was just solely anxiety but apparently no one wants to believe that, my family say ‘they don’t know you like we do, trust us it’s anxiety’ 

Fuck no I don’t trust you. In 2020, they said some symptoms I was having was anxiety and guess what, it was Crohn’s disease and I nearly bloody died from it was so bad. 

For context my symptoms are lightheadedness, I feel like I’m going to pass out 24/7 and I feel like I’m in a dream. My vision doesn’t seem right. Things move slower than they are if that makes sense, nothing looks right. My neck is severely tight, my jaw kills and my upper back kills. I have this weird feeling in my chest that I can’t explain, it’s just a cold strange feeling that is really uncomfortable. I feel like I’m dying and I experience this 24/7. Sometimes I can bear it but recently I just can’t. I’ve done everything for anxiety, anti depressants, im doing talking therapies, I did start going out a bit more but I’ve not felt good at all recently so I’ve been home bound. 

What am I meant to do? Even my GP doesn’t know what to do with me he says in a medical mystery… that doesn’t help, I want these symptoms to leave me alone because it’s been several months of hell. I have no job, no friends, no partner all because I can’t function like a normal human. Yet it’s all anxiety… yeah sure. ",2024-11-09 18:13:33

In May of this year I went through some traumatizing events- I found out my bf was lying to me and since then have felt so betrayed and can’t get it out of my head what he did (don’t want to get into it). Around the same time I had a severe allergic reaction which then sent me into panic- had massive panic attack and somewhat of an out of body experience. I had to take a break from school and work and been at home all day since.

Since then I’ve been feeling so off everyday. Everyday I wake up from my sleep and get existential anxiety and dread asking myself questions like what’s the purpose of life etc and just feel so empty and feel no purpose for anything. I Was never like this before. I wake up being overwhelmed from everything that’s happened and get so anxious and have been constantly feeling detached like the world isn’t real and I’m living in a simulation rn where everyday is the same day. I feel so much dread and can’t stay in the present or enjoy anything. Is this normal? 

I started Prozac 23 days ago- 5mg for 13 days and 10mg for 10 days now but I feel no different other than some side effects which aren’t too bad, but my anxiety is the same and I feel so off it’s debilitating. I’ve been forcing myself to go on walks everyday outside, establish a routine, and get a job nearby to distract myself and it has somewhat helped take my mind off things but the existential anxiety and dread + detachment still happen frequently and it’s excruciating. 

And what sucks is I haven’t seen any benefits yet from the Prozac either. 

Have any of you guys gone through this? Any advice or tips on what I should do? Any advice on how to overcome this? Does it get better? 😭",2024-11-10 17:08:48

I was drinking a lot at the time and kept convincing myself I had all of these major issues. Sense then I've cleaned up my life a lot. 

  
However, I live with a constant deep train of thought about myself, my life, and everything I am doing. Its a general hum in my mind how I have to do this or that and then I will be a version of myself that is happy or fulfilled. I've recently noticed however that I've had my life together for quite a while now, no drinking or getting drunk or drugs, I have a small business that earns me a good income, a wife, and a good house and truck, I eat clean 80% of the time and hit my work outs. Despite this I am still left with this underlying tone of deep thinking and what I need to do to finally feel good or normal or to just exist in the present moment. I've learned that no matter my surrounding I am stuck with this. It is not always a panic attack or major fear. Its hard for me to just live in the present moment and feel content. Lately my vice is my mobile or computer to not be attentive in reality or to avoid work and obligations until I ultimately push through. 

Its really a strange feeling to explain but does this resonate with anyone? I find myself here on Sunday morning, all is going well but I don't feel content, calm or at peace. My body feels a bit full of jittery energy and I cant help but to feel like I need to do something and that's the theme of my life. ",2024-11-10 16:54:31

This also isn’t a case of anxiety causing stomach issues, something is actually wrong.  The stomach issues do worsen my anxiety though because I’m struggling to breathe correctly through my stomach so when I get anxious it feels like I can’t breathe. I hate anxiety. I hate being like this. I’ve literally been miserable this entire year and if I didn’t have anxiety I could have gone to the doctor months ago and been feeling better already.

Anxiety,1gnzard,Am I developping schizophrenia ? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnzard/am_i_developping_schizophrenia/,3,"Hi everyone, I am facing a lot of anxiety right now and I would like to talk about it. English is not my native language so I will try to do my best. 

  
My anxiety began when I was 20. I was smoking a lot of weed (maybe 3 or 4 joints per day) at that time, to relax  myself because I was shy. One day, I felt and could see my heart beating through my chest, and all the anxiety began at that moment. During almost 6 years straight, i was stressed all day, fearing of having a heart attack. Then it escalated to panick attacks, to the point where I couldnt go outside. It was horrible.

Then I found a book called Dare, and I began slowly to recover from pannic attacks, but it was very long.

  
Recently, my anxiety about my heart stopped a bit, and now, i am really fearing about developping schizophrenia. My older brother have this issue. Idk why I was looking for the symptoms on the internet, and then I began to fear every symptoms that i read.

Furthermore, I m very anxious in social situation too. I really fear of people making fun of me, I always think that I am weird, that I am not enough. So I really struggle maitening great relationships with the people I met in work.

  
I went to a psychiatrist a month earlier, It was prior looking for the symptoms of shizophrenia, He listened to me during 15 minutes i guess, and told me to take a medication called amisulpride. I asked him to tell me what my problem was, he struggle to say an answer and told me ""a sort of pessimist personnality""

  
When i got home from the appontement, I began to cry. The medication he gave me was an antipsychotic to cure schizophrenia. It was horrible. I talked to my mom about it, and she told me It was nothing psychiatric, and that she was like me at my age.

  
But now, I begin to really feel i am becomung schizophrenic. I am really in my head most of the time, when i see something moving i check to see it was not a delusion, each time i see a form in the street (like a tree) I am cheking if it is someone etc. I began to see eye floater in the corner of my eyes too, and it scares me a lot. 

This morning, I hear my mom twice, the exact same sound, she was in the basement and me in the kitchen. There was music in my phone, so i replayed the music to see if it was coming from my phone, and it didnt. And now i fear of asking my mom if it was her. 

  
So yeah it is very tough what i me leaving rn, I really struggle 6 years of my life with health anxiety, alone, reading books etc. If now i develop schizophrenia, it will be a disaster. 

  
What would you do ? I want to seek another psychiatrist but i have to wait until january. Idk what to do. Now im in my mom house, but I will work the next week and i really fear being alone in my house etc. ",2024-11-10 12:10:30

Anxiety,1gnv1wv,Crippling anxiety from fleas,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnv1wv/crippling_anxiety_from_fleas/,0,"We had few infestations with fleas since 2021.  First time, in 2021 we had no idea we had fleas. We (my husband and I) had the worst and the most itchy bites we ever experienced all over our bodies. But I was much worse and ended up in emergency because of allergic reaction. We didn't know what was causing it. Doctor even told us we had scabies. It happened 3 times every two months. So, for the third time, we found fleas all over our house. We had bunnies in closed part of our yard and stray cat was visiting them every day. So infestation started in that area. We didn't know anything about them, exept from few mentioning from the movies. Then we did our research, husband bought some insecticide which can be used inside too. We did our best to solve it. After that only few appeared. We didn't see or had bites for almost a year. Last year, in August, my husband went to that part where bunnies used to stay(we didn't have them for long time anymore) and it was  huge infestation. A stray cat delivered her 5 kittens there. And before she arrived, another one did that too. We (stupids!) didn't see a potential treath! He emediately went to buy the same treatment from before, but they didn't have it anymore. He bought something else. During that time my baby was eight months (and we had her via IVF after a hard battle with infertility and misscariage). My husband told me not to go out with the baby because there was a lot of fleas. We thought we didn't have them in our house. I had some bites, but I thought they were from mosqitos beacuse they weren't so bad. But the next day I started to find few in the house. That's when I started panicking.  Previous experience was horrible, but  I didn't have a baby to worry about. That is when my anxiety started to grow. My husband treated the yard almost every or every 2 days. The cat and kittens moved. And there was still a lot of them. There weren't many in the house. But I knew I had to treat it. And wash and clean everything. I didn't have a dryer so I didn' know where to dry the loundry because fleas were everywhere. I asked my sister to use her dryer. So after few days, I found few fleas in my sisters' house. We brought them, of course, but it didn't spread. We both bought steam cleaners. Infestation lasted for 6 weeks. I was afraid to go to our yard. I only went when we were going somehere with panick checking and shaking my clothes. Most of the time when we went back to to house, even after shaking our clothes outside and washing our legs and sandals, we would carry a least one flea into the house. So, whenever he was doing something in the yard, my husband would leave his clothes outside, beside his underwear and then go inside. My anxiety was crippling. I couldn't eat, I had constant diarrhea, nausea. Plus I was ehxausted from not sleeping and washing and cleaning the house after treatments. I had pannick attacks for example, before vacuuming because I was afraid to find one. Even when my husband said that he didn't spot any flea for some time outside, I couldn't dare to go out. It took weeks to try and I could barely stand on my legs when I did. I started therapy and I also went to the psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressant, some kind of sedative and something to calm my stomach. It worked for my stomach, but I was still drowning. I was always crying and felt like a bad mother for feeling like that. It took almost 8 years to have my baby and I now I I didn't have the strenght to fight flea infestation 😔 I had many rough situations in my family, cancers and deaths and I also had health issues. But I managed to deal with that. My psycologist said I had anxiety with stronger elements of depression. My doctor said it is just anxiety because after everthing I went through. They didn't diagnosed it ""postpartum"". So, after 4 weeks I felt better from antidepressants. I would go outside and be there for about 10 minutes. I was getting better. During June, the same cat returned and delivered babies in our shed. We didn't notice, because no one was entering there. And once again she brought fleas. But it didn't spread around the house. My sister got me flea bomb. It appeared to work. We didn't notice anything the rest of the summer. We didn't see that cat or any other for a long time. But recenty I saw another one near the house and 2 weeks ago it came on our terrace. A freaked out. I chased it away and then threw some hot water on the terrace where she was standing but I didn't threw it on the balcony which is next to it. When I checked the tiles, I noticed something like flea (the same colour and bit stripy) but it had anntenae. It walked for a bit and then it jumped. Then I found another one just jumping near the place the cat was standing. I started to panick. I took my daughter inside, took our clothes off  in front our door. I only had 2 small bites on my foot few days before, but I tought it was from mosqito because I went outside without socks (and there are many mosqitos). But last year the small fleas also gave me small bites ( I know because I notices 3 types and sizes and bigger ones were causing bigger bites). My husband treated the yard few times. He says he didn't notice any. I didn't notice anything in the house. But I vacuumed and steam cleaned thoroughly. I still steam clean. I am again afraid to go outside, which is making me feel horrible because my daughter wants to play outside. I still take her regulary somewhere else by car and we spend hours there so she can be outside. But when we come back, we take off our clothes in our hall and I steam clean it with our bags. My brother in law who lives on the second floor of our house says he saw the same cat 2 times and she was with a kitten. After that he saw 2 kittens. Probably hers. Thoose are stray cats. It is impossible to catch them and we don't have services who do that. Some people in the neighborhood are feeding stray cats and they wander around their houses. I am going crazy! How to keep them away from our propery?? We tried reppelent sprays-it did't work. We sprey them with water when we see them (and I don't want lectures from animal lovers). I didn""t mind their pees and poos, but after they are keep bringing me fleas, thay are ruining my life! We spent a lot of money because of this. I even had to buy a dryer and we have warm weather to dry them outside. What to do? To keep stripping and steaming our clothes at ur door? I am afraid of any visitors because they can bring it inside. I am afraid to go visit my family because I infected my sisters house last year. Sorry for this novel, and, yes, i know there arw much worse problems in life (and I used to handle those better) but this is making my anxiety crippling. If someone had some usefull advice how ro handle this, I would be thankfull.",2024-11-10 07:07:43

sometimes my allergies don’t even need a trigger to flare up, they just do.. and they also usually go away on their own, of course medication helps but in the end my body works to heal them in 3-5 days. which happens with anxiety too.

when i have bad anxiety “flare ups” it’s like my mind is irritated, just like when i have a dermatitis crisis that irritates my skin. i know they both will go away eventually though. so i just wait patiently until they do, and make sure i take care of myself as much as i can while i’m going through a rough patch.

Despite his talkative habits and his separation anxiety his school results are good or very good.

Anxiety,1gnziz7,Rumination and trouble sleeping,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnziz7/rumination_and_trouble_sleeping/,5,"Long story short, I have a lot of anxiety that stems from my interest in a coworker who I never asked out, and a couple months ago she got engaged to another coworker. I constantly ruminate over what ifs and all of my missed opportunities. If I'm busy or distracted, I can feel pretty normal. When I've got time to myself, especially at night, then I cannot stop myself from imagining things going differently-- All the opportunities I had to just ask her out, what my life could be like if we were together. It's such a painful regret and anxiety. I know I'm a bad person for thinking this, but I secretly still hope something happens to break them up and I daydream different such scenarios (though to be clear, I would never express how I feel to her or do anything to jeopardize her engagement). Rationally I realize that none of this productive, but I feel have no control.

One of the biggest issues is that it's disrupting my sleep pretty bad. I can usually fall asleep okay, but I wake up after 4-5 hours, and then I start thinking about the situation and my anxiety about finding someone and pretty quickly my heart is racing and I've got a knot in my stomach and can't fall back asleep.

Distractions (like watching Netflix) can help the anxiety, but then I'm still not falling back asleep.
I take propranalol for my anxiety, and it helped to an extent with the social/performance anxiety I was experiencing, but has not seemed to help at all with this. I'd prefer not to take more drugs, especially ones that I feel I might get dependent on like Xanax.
I have tried mindfulness practices with no luck, though I will try to commit more.
I know I need to start exercising.

I’ve been on Citalopram 40mg for 4 years and the last few years I have felt fatigued, flat and generally struggled to find joy in everyday life.

I’ve decided to start weaning off and am now down to 10mg and I feel so much better. I wake up feeling refreshed, have more energy, my mood is better and I am feeling feelings that I have not felt in ages - like joy, pride and contentment.

I am starting to think that the long term side effects were counter productive and that feeling flat and tired was not a symptom of the anxiety but the medication.

I am not giving medical advice here and speak o my of my own experience, but so far I am feeling so much more like my old self and I’m really hopeful that the quality of my life continues to improve at a lower dose and hopefully off of Citalopram entirely at some point soon.

All I ever read about Citalopram are horror stories about withdrawal. I’d love to hear any other success stories!

Best of luck, everyone with your own personal journeys!",2024-11-10 08:14:26

Hello all.

This is going to be a very personal post for me and I could really use some advice. 

I have terrible health anxiety and it’s really affected my quality of life. I developed my health anxiety due to multiple doctors not being able to find out what was going on with me for 7 months. 

I look back at my memories in my camera roll and I can’t help but miss who I used to be. I miss my old mind. 

I’ve had so many tests done, such as bloodwork,  a stool sample (I pray to God I never have to do that again), etc. So, if there was anything truly wrong with me, something would’ve showed up on any of those tests. 

The moment I find the tiniest thing wrong with my body, I immediately feel things in that area. I hate it. It happens all the time. 

My therapist told me that the reason I do this to myself is because I spent 7 months of my life focusing on something that was wrong (when people were telling me it was all in my head), that now, my mind is trying to find something new to focus on. She told me I need to rewire my mind, but i truly don’t know how to. 

I’ve always been against medication for anxiety, however I think it’s time to talk to my doctor. I went into my doctor’s office a couple of months ago and I was telling her how much I stress myself out and that it was really affecting me, but that I was in therapy for it. She told me if it didn’t get better, then we could possibly start talking about medication, but i said no. 

I truly never thought that I’d get to this point. It affects my daily life. My mind is never calm or peaceful anymore. I love being around my friends because they take my mind off of it, but I can’t be around them 24/7. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. 

If anyone else has advice, feels this way too, or has any information on anxiety medication, it would be very helpful. Thank you

I have been struggling a lot lately becsuse i have been manipulated by a friend multiple times and yes i know i should've let go a long time ago but i didn't.....i let her hurt me over and over again for 2 years until i am broken. she is not in my life anymore but i just feel so lost and confused and out of place. Recently what i have been struggling with the most is if i am capable of love or if i even have love in me......i (F20) am in a relationship wuth my boyfriend (M21) we have been together for 3 years and sure there has been up and downs ofc but i was always utterly and completely sure that i do love him without a doubt and that i want my future to be with him.


But...ever since this friend of mine who manipulated me is not in my life anymore i am having doubts whether i love him or if i love him right or enough. He has never been anything but kind sweet loving and supportive and he has been there with me through all the friend put me through he supported me reassured me constantly. I just feel so so out of place idk who i am i have no sense of self or identity anymore and i feel completely uncapable of love.....idk if i love him anymore which hurts a lot and yes i have talked about it all with him and he is very loving and supporting he is not angry he says it's oksy to feel that way and that we will get through this together and that he loves me even if i am unsure of my feelings he doesn't pressure me at all he is such a pure sweet soul and it breaks my heart that i can't love him right......it just hurts so much....am i falling out of love with him? or are my thoughts just all over the place? is this the aftermath of everything this friend put me through? when will i heal what do i do? i constantly feel like a horrible person i don't really feel angry often so i never snap or anything but i feel like i am hurting him by not being able to love him the way i used to......he assures me that he is here and he is not going anywhere and he loves me no matter how dark it might seem. i sometimes wish i never met the friend who manipulated me she really said hurtful things very harsh and hurtful things about my relationship with him too. Like ""well i feel like you don't love him enough and someday he will find someone who will love him right and really show him thst love"" or ""well maybe he is not the right one if he doesn't help you heal"" and that left scars in me i told my bf about it and he got very angry at her not at me. i know that it's in the past but it still hurts.....



I sometimes feel so numb like i don't feel anything anymore at all....do i need to break up with him? bc i am unsure of my love for him? but i have never had doubts before only after the friend ghosted me....i feel like he deserves so much better bc i am a horrible person.....idk what to do...



i am sorry it's so long i just had to get it out somewhere my thoughts are all over the place so sorry if anything i say doesn't make sense.



and yes i am aware therapy is an option to consider but i have had an uncomfortable encounter with a therapist and i struggle a lot with anxiety so i am scared. I am posting this on here bc i don't want to burden my friends they are very supportive but i just feel like a constant burden to the world.",2024-11-10 06:42:37

So I've been on SSRIs for several years now for anxiety—I think I've tried Paxil, BuSpar, Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Citalopram—as well as several for sleep or as needed including amitriptyline, doxepin, trazodone and just prescribed nortriptyline. 

I've been on Wellbutrin about two years now. In addition to that, I've been on Prozac for maybe 6-8 months now. Prozac worked really well at first but seems to no longer have any impact. 

My Doc just prescribed me BuSpar (I haven't taken this in maybe 4 years so I don't remember what it was like)—but my question is does it seem safe and or/normal to be put on THREE at once? It just seems like... dangerous or not healthy. I mean, I didn't ask about any risks involved, but he also didn't tell me to be aware of any. 

Technically it will be four (three SSRIs and one tricyclic (sp?) once I get the nortriptyline prescription filled.

The doctor suspected that I had a seizure because I bit my tougue. I am discharged now and haven’t taken any lorazepam since then but it is hard. My anxiety level is at all time high. I am completely dysfunctional in life. My life is a mess. I don’t know what to do besides sitting on the couch crying all day.",2024-11-09 06:27:44
Anxiety,1gnxkfm,Starting Sertraline AGAIN or another SSRI?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnxkfm/starting_sertraline_again_or_another_ssri/,2,"Hi all

I was on sertraline for 7 years for mild depression. It helped. I came off them last year as I didn't think I needed them anymore.

Fast forward to March of this year, I was going through some really stressful times with anxiety and was prescribed sertraline again. I took a 50mg tablet before bed, woke at 4am having a full blown panic attack (hadn't had a panic attack for years prior to this). This completely put me off taking another tablet as I was terrified of this happening again.

Fast forward again to a couple of months ago... I've been taking a weight loss injection, Mounjaro, which little did I know, has a side effect of anxiety.... my anxiety for the last 2 / 3 months has been frightening. I've been having daily panic attacks and nothing I'm doing is helping this awful feeling of anxiety, fear, panic etc. I've come off the injections but I don't see myself getting better without medication.

I've developed health anxiety, medication anxiety, intrusive and very unwanted thoughts, anxiety over just about everything. I've never felt this way before.

I think I have to go back on sertraline or another type of SSRI but I'm so afraid of the side effects. I'm just afraid of everything right now. 

Does anyone have experience with the same sort of thing? Are any of you on sertraline for severe anxiety and panic attacks???? How did you manage side effects etc? Are there better medication than sertraline with less side effects?

I feel completely lost right now, so looking for some reassurance. Thanks x

One time I tried taking 3 doses at once, my doctor said it’s the max I can take per day if I had a really bad panic attack, ect.
I took 3 0.5 pills, and felt like never before. I finally felt like myself! I was dealing with bad EDs and I suddenly had a craving for ice cream (lol) so I ordered it and it was the most delicious thing I had to eat EVER. And the guilt didn’t even kick in, I simply didn’t care at all. After that experience, I started to self medicate and decided my own doses, read about it a bunch ect. I was a dumb 14 yo just so we’re clear, never do this yourself please.
I started taking them once a week in larger doses, between 2-5 0.5 pills. It was absolutely amazing, the days I decided to do that made me be able to keep on going with my life.
So, fast forward to present time. It’s been about 7 years of regular use of klonopin, I have a prescription for 2mg daily, but I still do the same as I used too, take about 3-5 pills of 2mg once or twice a week and really enjoy that day. Now’s where the problem kicks in :

I stopped feeling it. Almost completely.
It used to feel euphoric, like everything is going to be okay, like I don’t care about anything (in a good way), stopped my over - thinking, made me hungry and made every food taste absolutely incredible, and so much other things.

I’ve had periods where I stopped for a month, tops. Maybe helped once but not anymore that’s for sure.
I don’t know what to do, I assume my body got used to it and has to get a significant enough cold turkey stop, but I can’t seem to bring myself to do so. My life is so stressful, and I’m looking forward for my “klonopin” days all the time…
Really important to me to highlight - dependent? Yes, addicted? No. I actively choose to have my “klonopin days” on days where I’m most busy and working, I don’t “get off” on the high most of the time, just happy I can function as A normal human being, nullifying my anxiety.
What should I do? I lost all direction, I would love it if you have some suggestions. Thanks in advance.",2024-11-10 09:33:13

*delete if not allowed*

You can shame be all you want but I want to ask should I even consider myself a coaster enthusiast?

The only coasters I have ridden is a dragon wagon ride (it’s a powered coaster so idk if it counts) at a yearly county fair, the original Fire in the Hole at Silver Dollar city and American Thunder at SFSL (2013). 

I used to get teased by others for such a low count. I have anxiety (and depression)and it took me years just to conquer American Thunder. I want to ride more coasters but with the teasing I occasionally get (with the recent teasing I got just earlier tonight on Instagram). I still get excited when coasters are announced and I love playing RCT2 and still have a passion for theme parks. 

I don’t go to amusement parks because I don’t and can’t just travel anytime I want especially if my blood sugars go above 200 or below 120. The nearest amusement park is Six Flags St Louis and when I went in 2016 (last time I went to an amusement park) I couldn’t even ride American Thunder because I just got nervous. When I first rode American Thunder I have my then girlfriend to ride with me (I was still closest and didn’t come out as gay yet) but when I went in 2016 (and despite being with friends) I just got nervous and couldn’t even get on American Thunder.


Maybe I deserve all the online teasing I get but my question is should I even bother considering myself a roller coaster enthusiast if I can’t even ride American Thunder back in 2016?",2024-11-10 06:48:31
Anxiety,1gnurio,Travel anxiety,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnurio/travel_anxiety/,0,"Hi everyone,

Lately, my anxiety has become more intense, especially when I’m traveling alone on public transport or intercity trains. I often feel this overwhelming sense that something bad might happen like I might faint, find myself helpless or be unable to tell anyone nearby how I’m feeling.

When the anxiety hits, I experience dizziness, nauseousnsss, sweaty palms, sometimes blurry vision, way faster heartbeat, and a sense of weakness especially in my legs if I'm standing up. 

 I used to love traveling by all kinds of transportation, but recently, I’ve found myself strongly avoiding it. I only feel secure if I’m with someone else who could help if something goes wrong or someone I can talk to in general. 

A few days ago, I had to take an important trip to Vienna, which was an 8-hour journey by train. The moment I boarded, my anxiety flared up, and I wanted to get off at the very next stop. (I did manage to make it through the trip, though haha)

Has anyone else experienced this kind of anxiety, particularly when it comes to public transportation and what do you think the trigger can be? 

I used to feel this way before as well, it went away and now out of a sudden it started again..

He’s often excited to meet people and I’ve tried to set a boundary around people encouraging him to jump on them and thought we were over that but apparently not. I was taking him out to pee at 10 pm because one of my arms is in a sling from a whole silly wrist fracture situation and it’s a pain to walk him like that at peak dog walking hour. 

There has been a ton of concern about how selfish and inconsiderate and sort of the worst of humanity that dog owners are on the subreddit for my city. Untrained, offleash dogs are a genuine issue so my dog becoming part of the flood of stories about how someone got slobbered on or accosted by a dog is a real nightmare for me. 

A few months ago, my dog howled in the shower after I had to wash him to check for injuries after a dog bit him (I didn’t know the other dog was resource guarding when I/my dog tried to retrieve the ball it dropped, which was mine and the owner was MIA). My downstairs neighbor heard it through the pipes and apparently thought my dog was seriously injured and texted my landlord, who immediately texted me that concern. I think the neighbor was probably really upset and bothered by the noise so I left notes on the doors of everyone in the complex (8 units) apologizing for the noise and provided my phone number to fix any issues. But, I couldn’t sleep for about two days. 

Admittedly, I’ve spent a lot of time on r/dogfree because I want to make sure I’m not doing things that bother other people unknowingly and I’d like to be less of a social nuisance while having a dog. This doomscrolling definitely does contribute to my anxiety, but I feel like people should be informed about why other people feel their choices are socially harmful (in my case, having a dog). 

It feels like every time my dog acts out of line I’m about to have a panic attack.  He’s an anxious dog, and it seems to make his behavior worse and him more stressed out too.

He would often encourage me to try to get out of my comfort zone and try to talk even tho anxiety is hitting me.

Right now, we are travelling abroad and are in Amsterdam. We were on canal tour ride on boat. There were speakers talking about what we were seeing but I couldn't hear anything because three girls were talking and laughing so loud. They were in their late 20s or maybe early 30s and I thought nothing bad can happen and that they would understand if i told them to be a little quieter. I was sad because I truly couldn't hear anything and wanted to try to stand up for myself and I asked them if they could be just a little bit quieter because I don't hear speakers. 

They immediatly attacked me how this is public space, that they are enjoying themselves, that I'm destroying their ride and I must live sad life if I hate seeing people be happy. I felt embarassed and I couldn't tell them anything else, I just turned around and wanted to cry but also didn't want to destroy this ride to my bf and neither wanted them to see me sad and shaken up. I don't even remember the rest of ride, they were talking to me all time and I was just hearing them and 
 I'm so mad at myself because I'm weak and cant even stand up for myself when someone else is talking bad about me and my anxiety was rising so I didn't really talk wih my boyfriend either. Even 10 hours later I'm stll thinking about our little talk and how embarrased I felt.
Even when the ride was over, I heard them yelling to my bf that I need spark in my life and they can give him tips, that I'm loser, that I'm living sad life etc.. i was pretending that i couldnt hear them and that I was looking on my phone but was very shaken about it all.

My bf didn't stand up for myself but he said that he didn't see point with talking to them because I didn't do anything wrong and they were so rude and talk with them would be just a waste of time and even tho I agree with him and of course I didn't want to make scene, I'm little sad. 

Anyway I know I won't see them ever again, but I am still little shaken up. Hopefully one day I can stand up for myself and even if the conversation doesn't end how I wanted, I could just forget about everything!",2024-11-10 06:29:39

He's a skater, has a huge circle or friends and social life, and I never dealt with this in the past as I only had 1 relationship before him (lasted 3 years). When we started dating, I got very triggered since he's the type of person that doesn't have a schedule, goes with the flow, and has a hard time sticking to plans after saying yes to every single thing that anyone invites him to. He would say ""I'll let you know"" and then not let me know, wouldn't text me back, and when he would go out with his friends he would just disappear and text me the next day (if he did). We spent a lot of time together, and he slept over at my place very constantly, but when we were not together, his communication was pretty much nonexistent.

The hardest part would be when we had a fight. He's a secure person but has some avoidant tendencies that come up during conflict sometimes. He would completely shut down, not talk, it was very scary for me because I would just think he was going to leave me and that I messed everything up.

This caused me to start having anxiety and panic attacks, and create all these stories in my head and go into a spiral I couldn't pull myself out of. No matter how much reassurance he would give me and even if things were good, I would always think something was wrong, ""he's not talking to me because he doens't want to be with me anymore"", ""he thinks I'm annoying"", ""he doesn't care about me"", ""I'm way too needy, I need to stop"" Then I would be proven wrong, turns out I had nothing to worry about, and  this loop would all happen over and over AND OVER again. I was doing therapy for all of this, but eventually went to the doctor and after having an episode in his office, I was prescribed with Lorazepam, which I am only supposed to take when I'm having a panic attack. I was having them 2-3 times per week.

I don't want to make this too long, we have come a long way, he now texts me goodnight and replies to my texts (like a regular person), calls me in the morning when we're not sleeping together the night before, sticks to his word and plans with me, and no more of those ""shutting down"" episodes. I have been doing so well the past couple of months, I haven't taken an anxiety pill in weeks.

And then something happened again 2 nights ago, where he shut down and I got incredibly triggered, and I haven't been able to let it go. Things did go differently this time, as he came back to me very quickly, apologized and recognized what was happening and we talked.

I had a panic attack last night and I needed to call him to just hear his voice and tone to make sure he's not mad at me and that we were okay, which I realized he wasn't the second he picked up the phone. I'm going into spirals again. I feel like this event, even if it wasn't as bad as before, has set me back again and I feel like I lost all my progress. I feel so alone and helpless and lots of shame for being like this, why can't I just accept that everything is fine and behave like a regulated person? Why can't I accept it was just a bump in the road and it's nothing compared to all the good? There's SO MUCH good, it breaks me that it's not enough. Then what is enough?

Anxiety,1gnluzn,Yelled at by a stranger ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnluzn/yelled_at_by_a_stranger/,1,"I had an interaction this morning and I hate that I’m still rattled by it. 

I was in the gym grabbing my stuff from the locker room. I was looking at my phone and a random lady thought I was taking a photo (I wasn’t). Immediately she starts yelling at me. I mean, YELLING. Demanding I delete the “photo” of her, going off about how there were naked people in the locker room. We were in a corner area, far from the showers (big gym) and there weren’t even any other people around, much less any naked people. I tried to tell her that I didn’t even take a photo but she would not stop screaming to even let me speak. It was horrible. 

I eventually just got my things and left. As I’m walking out she’s still shouting about it. It really shook me up. I know I didn’t do anything wrong but I can’t shake the stress and anxiety of the situation. What if she complains about me and I get into trouble? What if other people heard her and think a certain way about me? What if I run into her again in the gym? 

I completely understand people not wanting anyone taking photos in the locker room. I get that. Our gym is big and popular and I do see other people doing it occasionally, but I’ve never seen anyone say anything about it. And how hard would it have been to say, “hey, I think I just saw you take a photo. Please don’t do that, it makes me uncomfortable.” I feel like I could’ve explained myself easily and there would have been no issue. How on early do people think it’s okay to just immediately start yelling? At strangers?? In public??? I’m also 15 weeks pregnant so extra sensitive right now, which isn’t helping. I’ve tried to just brush it off but it’s ruined my day. 

It was humiliating and I’m having so much anxiety about it. Please help me shake this. ",2024-11-09 22:33:55

At times, when it first started and I was having panic attacks frequently, I was worried I was going ""insane"" because I was having trouble thinking straight and felt like I was not fully in control of my thoughts or emotions. Since then I have calmed down pretty significantly, but I have had trouble shaking the overall sentiments. There are still days where I get worried every time a muscle twitches or I have to read something twice, as though it indicates something seriously wrong. It's like there is a part of me that knows I'm being very silly and a part of me that is genuinely worried I'm about to perish via what amounts to spontaneous brain combustion. That is kind of worrisome to me, this weird irrational dichotomy. I realized recently though, that such a thing is not particularly uncommon.

I asked about my plan, only to get left delivered for 4 days. 


They ""read"" my message eventually, but that was only to ask about another club, and after I had replied, I was yet again left on read for another 3 days. They never replied to my original message.


I decided to try to be the bigger person and stop dooming over getting repeatedly left on read in regards to crucial issues regarding our club operations. So after the 5th day, I decided to reach out again and ask them about the original question again. It's been a week since. I have been still getting left on delivered. 


Quite frankly, it's not like I can cut them off like a friend, they are essential. Without them, I'll get bombarded and overloaded with having to plan everything (which ironically is the case now LOL) I can't tell if it's perhaps my fault, maybe my message was too long?

My first post here. I have had panic attacks here and there throughout my life. But recently I have been extremely stressed, and had 2 panic attacks in 1 week. A week apart. Last night over eating Popeyes caused the worst panic attack I have ever had in my life. I was convinced I was on the verge of death. I almost called 911. What a terrible feeling. I could not relax. It was triggered by over eating yesterday, and a high level of stress lately. Problem is, I am terrified of eating again. I am so afraid of every going through and feeling that way again. We are talking about laying on the floor in full terror mode. I can compare it to being strapped in an airliner that is on its way to crash, not able to move, and not able to get out of the situation. Nearing certain death. That is how it felt last night. And since it was linked to eating, I feel terrified of eating again. This bout of anxiety has paralyzed me. I dont even feel like I can leave the house after that. Anyone can relate to something like this?  Just need some kind words of encouragement. I feel like I am losing control of my mind, and the panic boss is in charge.

My fear has gotten to a point where i will take a 20 minute detour just because i saw a black cat cross the path where i would have walked if i didnt see it, setting the volume of music at 12 or 14 just to avoid 13 or grabbing 12 or 14 pieces of things when im asked to grab 13 and telling someone i just counted wrong. The worst thing is that recently, i got back from a trip and i needed to take the train and the only available seat was marked with a number 13. When i got off the train and started walking back home, thinking that im dumb to believe in such things as bad luck, i nearly got mugged by a man with a knife for the first time in my life and the fear has only deepened by then (nearly because i saw a part of a silver switch knife in his hand which he held extremely tight and i ran away before he could even extend it and threaten or hurt me). 

Also i have a deep fear of fortune telling or those comment chains like ""if you dont do something, something bad will happen"" which i skip as fast as i can. The most recent situation was today at work when i bought myself some juice, where in my country a specific brand of juice has little writings underneath the cap with inspirational texts like ""be happy"" or ""do the thing you always wanted to"". But today i got ""something unexpected might happen today!"", it was written in a positive way but i still was stressed for the whole day and couldnt stop being alert of every possible danger around me. 

I know its extremely stupid and irrational but i cant get over it. Its my first time sharing this fear with someone besides me as i dont want to talk about this with anyone who knows me personally, its embarassing and childish but i would gladly take some advice how to manage this fear and maybe even an explanation as to why i could be fearing something like that as a young adult.

It’s been this way for days. I thought today was anxiety free but when I sat down to eat another massive wave of nausea washed over me and I could barely stomach a few bites.

My anxiety likes to focus on the fear of not being able to take care of myself. Being so nauseous I can’t eat is feeding that anxiety which is feeding the nausea. It grows and grows.

Anxiety,1gnd1hj,Losing friends as an adult :(,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnd1hj/losing_friends_as_an_adult/,2,"I recently lost my friend group; my mental health was really low and I felt like I wasn’t really myself. My friends were there for me at the start and I relied on them - during this time my communication wasn’t the best and I struggled to initiate conversations with them and ask questions; normal friend things. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour on my anxiety and mental health issues but I felt like I had a lot on my plate and I was overthinking every single thing going on in my life.

I understand that that must have been annoying and frustrating but I don’t think it warranted the friendship ending. We took a break at first and then when I asked to meet up and talk about things I was told by one of them that it was a relief not to have to worry about me over the last few months. That knocked my confidence so low. I was trying to better myself and I was just starting therapy to help me get through things (I’m doing better mentally now) and I thought maybe we could go back to how things were - she didn’t want that. 

During that conversation I told her how sorry I was for not communicating and not being a better friend and that I was doing what I can to become a better person. I just felt judged and so small, I was just so anxious and depressed by it all, it was another stress on top what was already going on at home. It felt like everything to do with the friendship was my job to fix and it was all too much. It didn’t feel like it would be a team effort.

I distanced myself to work on myself and even though she told me that I could speak to her if I wanted to, I couldn’t, especially after being told that it was basically a relief for me not to be in her life. How can I be expected to be comfortable with her after that? 

After a few months, I was told that I didn’t have to isolate myself and do things on my own and why didn’t I message in all that time. But it’s a two way street, isn’t it? If she was worried about me she could have reached out. 

I replied that I get her point of view but I didn’t feel comfortable anymore reaching out and how my time processing didn’t align with her view on when I should have messaged her. 

I think I’ve grown in my time apart from them, I am more independent and less reliant on people. I have started trying new things that I wouldn’t have in the past. I’m proud of myself and the journey. I’m just sad that a friendship group from my formative years has come to an end. This has made me realise that it’s hard making friends as an adult. But I think I will be okay.

I’m not looking for advice, per se, on this; I just wanted to let this all out and rant.",2024-11-09 15:52:31

Does anybody else experience this? So ive been on Escitalopram for about 3 three weeks now because i have GAD, i was on 5mg for 12 days and now 10mg for 7 days. Im feeling heavier side effects from upping dosage than when starting. Its manageable and doesnt mostly interfere with work or anything(except sleep a little). Today i went to sleep 6.30AM because i was feeling nauseus and had anxiety, woke up 6hours later and knew i was going to have one of the bad days aaand i was right. Most of the day felt nauses and had some anxiety. Then i met up with my friend, hung out and then went to pick up his girlfriend. When we picked up his girlfriend i started to feel higher levels of anxiety and panic to the point i felt i was going to pass out. I immediately told my friend to stop the car so i could buy a coke from the gas station to spike my blood sugar. FYI i have a phobia of passing out so spiking my blood sugar usually helps with that. So i drank the coke and then the high levels of anxiety and panic went away and now im feeling much much much better, even my nausea is gone.

Anxiety,1gnkmsz,Been suffering from performance anxiety/ chronic procrastination and is destroying my life ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnkmsz/been_suffering_from_performance_anxiety_chronic/,1,"Hi everyone, 
It has taken me years to admit to this. Pls be gentle! 

From outside everybody thinks I’m wise, know what I’m doing and have it together. But they have  no idea how much I suffer. I think my higher functioning language and social skills is what’s deceiving ppl in their perspective of me. 

I procrastinate like to the very last second. I was able to pull it off with a lot of anxiety and anguish in the past until recent years that it feels like  it’s coming to crash. I can’t pull it off anymore and it’s def affecting my performance at work, I have a messy room, bills are late, my investments are a mess bc I don’t manage them well and they are just sitting there, etc. I make very bad decisions bc I overthink and overthink every details of that decision and wait until the last minute and usually make a decision in a hurry at the 11th hour and many times it’s not a good one . Cognitively I’m not dumb, I was a straight A student, have a professional career and relatively had a successful life but it’s falling apart in the recent years.  I feel like I can’t hide anymore and this is catching up to me. I know what many of you are going to suggest, but I tried and didn’t work. Therapy and their suggestions like Making lists, prioritizing, small goals, blah blah didn’t work. Therapists( the one I went to)  don’t understand how paralyzing this chronic procrastination can be. I’m assuming this is an executive functioning dysfunction? I’m not expecting you guys to diagnose me on Reddit lol but this is one step I’m taking for support or insight/ guidance. I’d really appreciate any input. 

(I was ashamed to admit to this on my primary account. I made this acct to hide about this issue … as usual) 

Adding- if I didn’t mention ADHD, it doesn’t mean im not screaming it:) as many of you might agree, anxiety, ADHD, procrastination, etc are co- morbid, and closely related issues. ",2024-11-09 21:36:59

Wrote this poem on the notes app on my phone and then went back to sleep.

I am not a poet. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever done anything artistic/expressive in my life. I don’t know where it came from. But it felt surprisingly good to just be happy that I like the way it turned out, and not care about whether or not it’s perfect.

Sharing because I feel proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve struggled with this for a very long time, but finally starting to feel at peace with it.

=========================

Embers

The embers have died low again.

Can’t take the cold, it prickles, stings.

I wonder what’s the purpose if

The house is still and clean,

But I can’t feel the love of home

Or that of anything.

I’m here, alone, inside my head.

It’s empty with no hope or feeling

but pain.

The pain you cannot see, 

“so does it really count?”

Just burns me to the core, then blows the ashes all about.

Been here before. I’m at the brink

Of what any one can surely take. 

But then I take a breath, and blow.

The air that keeps me here with them.

The embers crackle, hiss, and burn.

Now bright again, and brighter still.

The fear, anxiety, control,

A different kind of pain, but one that keeps me going.

Unbearable to touch,

I grip the embers in my hand, fist clenched,

And walk back into life.

Let’s try one last new treatment, guru, cure.

Perhaps this time it will help.

The embers keep me burning,

For one more day, a week, a year.",2024-11-09 21:34:13

Perfectionist/Type A personality here. I have GAD and have struggled with depressive episodes/symptoms/low moods since I was a teenager. I've been experiencing significant stress and issues with my relationship for the past few months. I think the stress is starting to realtake its toll on me because I've been feeling depressive symptoms for the past few weeks (struggling to get out of bed in the morning, loss of interest in hobbies, low motivation at work). Yesterday was a complete write-off. I work from home, and I did about 3 hours of work before breaking down crying and spending the rest of the day on the couch.

I have healthy routines and habits that I've worked hard to develop and I know help me. I work out everyday, get 10k+ steps, eat the recommend amout of fruits/veg and (try) to limit my social media scrolling to 10 mins per day. 

Yesterday and didn't do any of those habits and I felt so guilty because of it. The anxiety/guilt over it caused my mood to be even lower and I felt just as bad today, repeating the same pattern.

I'm such a perfectionist and I take pride in being the kind of person that ""has it all together"" especially with work and wellness. Being someone who is high achieving has become a part of my identity that is so at odds with how I feel during depressive episodes.

Anxiety,1gnnind,"Worried that I have something wrong with me, am I trippin'?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnnind/worried_that_i_have_something_wrong_with_me_am_i/,0,"This is not a joke, regardless of how dumb this all sounds maybe to you, it feels very real for me. I just am hoping for some reassurance or anything ...ANYTHING that came make me feel better to be honest, that I'm working myself up over potentially nothing and am assuming the worst.

Back in September I was (happy) anxious over something, my appetite waxed and waned a bit, but I still ate (pretty) normally. I noticed one day at work that my pants felt a little looser, my belt also felt a little to. This started a snowball effect of panic for me for the last month and a half. I went home, and weighed myself, I was 147. My normal was somewhere around 149-151. My waist was 31"", which is around normal. All of my normally tight pants were easier to put on, so I know something changed right? For the next week or two, I just kept an eye on all of that, weight, waist, and clothing fit. Always fell somewhere between 147-149 and waist was always 30.75"" - 31.5"". Then I noticed at work that my belly button was soft and ill-formed. It wasn't taught or defined looking, it was soft and squishy, I also noticed below my navel, my lower abdomen was like...flat, and I could suck it into my body, so then I really freaked out. My stomach in general was more jiggly and malleable and not taught and distended like it usually is, for example, I could put on a tight pair of pants that the act of cinching the pants made my navel squish. I have rolls around my waist where my ribs are that I could pull on and poke when I sat crouched, and my breasts felt floppier. Then the next day I noticed the skin under my breasts felt crepey, or loose, like they've been deflated, and my nipples felt floppy and not hard, but it was all only even evident when lying flat. Then its just been one thing after another, my nose feels softer and smaller, like the head of my nose is shrinking, feel like my earlobes are dropping, the corners of my mouth are looser,  my shoulders feel bonier, my butt seems like it may becoming softer? I look pale, My skin is EXCEPTIONALLY soft right now, I mean everywhere, it is like BABY soft. And my skin everywhere feels like, loose from my skeleton or like more plump/saggy(?), my nails feel thinner, my hair seems thinner, my hairs pluck out easier.

Again, my weight is still 147ish, waist pretty much the same, I have had diarrhea off and on, my appetite also is off and on, and is highly dependant on how nervous I am and time of day (for example, I wake up anxious, food is a struggle, feel confident towards dinner and starving, gobble 4 slices of pizza). I FORCE MYSELF TO get to 1200 calories a day so the appetite thing shouldn't matter fyi.  

My BF, who sees me every day says I'm losing my damn mind and he's felt and looked at EVERYTHING I'm worried about and always says ""it feels like it's always felt' or ""it feels normal"" or ""you're hyperfocusing on things that were always there that you never paid attention to before"". I took photos of my face, same angle, place, lighting as a photo from 4 months ago and my face looks pretty much exactly the same, lips, nose, folds, shadows, etc...but every part of my body FEELS different, and I know for a damn fact my stomach is flatter and weirder.

I've pretty much had to budge on going to a doctor now (even though I have white coat syndrome) cause I've never been this paranoid and concerned about pretty much any disease in my life, and I am someone who was diagnosed when I was 17 with a hypochondriac disorder. That being said, all because I am a hypochondriac doesn't mean I am impervious to disease, and that's what keeps my up at night. 

I'm worried about Cachexia, << this is like my kryptonite rn, I'm deathly afraid that my body is wasting away and I have undiagnosed cancer. Cachexia is often the FIRST sign you have cancer, and is associated with terminality. It's progressive muscle and fat wasting WITH OR WITHOUT WEIGHT LOSS, and regardless of eating, causes appetite loss, loose skin, body changes, skin changes, nail brittleness, etc. 


Again, I have a scheduled appt, I'm freaking out tho in the meantime. After reading this, and what I am worried this is, does it seem like I'm dying? Is there any reason to think this is NOT cachexia? Any reassurances? ",2024-11-09 23:54:23

I have barely slept - maybe 5-6 hours total over the past 4 nights. 

Given how intense my feelings have been, I’ve been looking up therapists and sending out feelers to see who’s accepting patients.

However, I can’t get over this sincere feeling of guilt about sharing my specific anxieties - because they’re issues that may impact the therapist as well. It’s not like I’m having marriage trouble or something and the therapist can remain completely impartial. I’m worried that I’ll “infect” the therapist with my anxieties, if that makes sense.

Looking for advice.

Basically I decided to do something about my anxiety and went to a doctor, they recommended Zoloft. I took a 50 mg pill 2 days in a row and wow was that the worst decision of my life. I had crazy side effects, I won’t list them all mainly heightened anxiety and paranoia but I stopped cold turkey after 2 days. 

The worst was my intrusive thoughts went wild. I’ve always had a fear of death where a lot of my anxiety comes from, you know my chest gets tight and I think I’m dying from a heart attack. This is different though, I’m thinking about how death is inevitable and how life is meaningless, it’s terrifying me. It’s been about a week since I stopped.

Anxiety,1gnjfh5,Fit but Always Out of Breath: My 9-Year Struggle with Unexplained Shortness of Breath upon exertion,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnjfh5/fit_but_always_out_of_breath_my_9year_struggle/,0,"
I’m a 23-year-old male with an athletic build and an active lifestyle. I’ve been into fitness and football for years, but I’ve struggled with shortness of breath upon exertion for as long as I can remember. This only happens during exertion and not when i am at home for a example in a rest state.—this started when I was around 14 or 15. Despite being in great shape, it’s always felt like my stamina hits a wall, and I can’t catch my breath as well as I should.

Over the years, I’ve been to numerous specialists: my primary doctor, a cardiologist, a hematologist, and even other consultants. Each one ran tests and ultimately said everything looked “fine.” The responses were all the same, and I kept hearing that there was nothing wrong with my heart, lungs, or general health.

As someone who takes my health seriously, I started diving into my own research and looking at things from a nutritional angle. I found that my hemoglobin and red blood cell counts tend to hover on the low side of normal, and I have also tested low for intracellular copper. I thought iron might be an issue, so I tried heme iron supplements for a while, but they didn’t seem to make a difference.

I’ve even tested for B vitamins that affect oxygen transport—like B12, B9, and B6—by checking my homocysteine and MMA levels, and all of that ruled out deficiencies in those areas. And I’m sure this isn’t a breathing technique issue; it really feels more systemic than that.

So, I’m stuck trying to figure out what nutritional deficiencies or imbalances could be contributing to this unexplained shortness of breath. I can sometimes also feel
Anxiety related feelings but not severe. I’m wondering if there are specific amino acids or micronutrients that I haven’t explored yet that could affect my oxygen levels or red blood cell efficiency.",2024-11-09 20:41:10

How am I just figuring this out?!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnj9sa/attachment_anxiety_how_am_i_just_figuring_this_out/,0,"Although I was previously in therapy for 3+ years, it wasn't until this past month that I have connected the dots. My early attachemnt (or lack thereof) is the contributing factor of a decade long battle with anxiety, sadness, fear, and mood dysregulation.

It wasnt until I was recounting an early memory, what I thought was a rather silly story from my first day of Kindergarten at 4 years old, where I remember feeling so terrified to my core of going into the scary big world of school. Once the bell rang, my new teacher had to pull me off my mothers chest and I screamed and begged and cried to make it stop. To my 4 year old brain, it felt like I was going to die. Coming from a home and mother with already minimal attachment, that was the last bit I was holding on to.

Throughout the following 20+ years, coupled wiht feeling unsafe at home from authoritatian and critical parents who did they best they could when trying to show love, I struggled and now I can look back and see why.

My root of disregulation, CPtsd, and up and down mood now all makes so much sense. For 3+ years I was in psychodynamic therapy which I can see now was not helpful. It recreated my attachement issues becuase I felt good when I was there with her, but terrible the days apart. All we did was talk abou the past, which offered me clarity, but I didnt lean tools like DBT or CBT like I am doing now with a new therapist.

Somedays I have a little more hope now that I think I have found the cause for the bleeding, but other days I am too overwhelmed. Hoping to hear that this is normal and things will get better as a 27(F).",2024-11-09 20:34:11

Anxiety,1gnizt3,Help in finding ways to cope,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnizt3/help_in_finding_ways_to_cope/,0,"Male. 33. I flagged this as driving anxiety but I fear it may becoming a more generalized anxiety. I have a first appointment with my therapist in a month, and I'll ask him for more counselling, but I wanted to get started on my own.  
Long story short, I always hated driving at night. I don't know if it's because of my car, if it's because of my eyes (strabismus + astigmatism) or anything else, but driving at night was always a tense moment for me. But nevertheless, I always did it (for brief distances, no more than 40km). 2 years and a half ago, after I got covid, I was driving at night and an incredible panic attack hit me, first time in my life, and I had to stop my car in the middle of the street and lie down, but from that day on, I developed severe daily dyspnea. It was like I couldn't do a full breathe without totally ""expanding"", like something got stuck in my throat; every like 5 minutes I had to make a sort of yawn to fully breathe, and it was exhausting. Nonetheless I stuck with this situation for 2 years thinking it was related to my health, and I did evey exam I could (spirometry, cardiologist, tomography) but nothing came up, except some little GERD.  
Then it hit me. I was the problem. Around June this year I started working out, running, I stopped smoking, and I practiced the 6 seconds in 6 seconds out breaths. And I can finally say my dyspnea is 90% cured. Every now and then I still visibly \*sigh\* to catch my breath, but I did it.  
Sadly, now I have to cope with anxiety. Something I didn't have for the last 2 years because I was fully focused on my breath. It's a stressfull period of my life, but it's mostly related to driving and/at night. Premise: I don't fear the dark. When I'm driving I get anxious. It's not in the form of tachycardia or trembling, my resting bpm is usually 70, 80/85 if I'm walking, and when I get this anxious it gets to like 95, but it's in the form of dizziness while driving, vertigo, knot in my stomach, etc. And it's awful if I'm driving, it's like I have motion sickness. And obviously it builds up, because it's unsafe driving like that. That led to me thinking I have some issues related to my eyes, my blood pressure or my blood sugar concentration (spoiler: I checked it this morning and it was 73, it should be ok, I guess). So now I keep googling my symptoms and I fully know that it's dumb.  
I still think that it's not fully anxiety, that it may be something related to my eyes + driving that CAUSES anxiety, and not the other way round, but I decided to try to cope with anxiety too.

So, I wanted to start mindfulness like many of you suggested, but people only talk about how they did great by doing mindfulness, and they are NEVER specific about what they did. I get it that mindfulness helped you, but EXACTLY what helped you? Like can anybody post a free guide for starting it? Or some excercises? Or anything else? Like you are in a gym ""Do X reps"" would be way more helpful that saying you did generic mindfulness. Any other tip would be appreciated",2024-11-09 20:21:09

Anxiety,1gniedq,Extreme fear of loosing the baby,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gniedq/extreme_fear_of_loosing_the_baby/,0,"An extreme fear of loosing my baby (TW: expression of fears) 

I'm 36 weeks pregnant and consumed with fear about losing my baby or something happening to her. Since the beginning of my pregnancy, I haven't been able to truly enjoy it because I've constantly felt that something bad might happen at any moment. I'm deeply afraid of carrying to 42 weeks and keep hoping that labor will start around 36-37 weeks. There are no medical indications to induce labor, but I am so emotionally exhausted and extremely scared.

Adding to my anxiety, I have a cyst in one of my teeth, and I'm terrified that this infection could harm the baby. I've consulted with at least five dentists, but none have been willing to remove the tooth, and my obstetrician also advised against any dental procedures until after delivery. Yet, everything I read online warns that a tooth infection could enter the bloodstream and harm the baby.

Additionally, my latest urine test showed 20-30 leukocytes, though the culture showed no specific concerns. My doctor assured me that everything was fine, but I’m still anxious about a possible untreated urinary tract infection. My fear has driven me to take genetic tests for thrombophilia, just in case, and I found I have certain MTHFR gene mutations that may raise homocysteine levels. I’ll be taking additional tests next week to investigate further. 

I'm so overwhelmed by fear every day and feel like I’m losing control. I worry constantly that the tooth infection and leukocytes in my urine could be dangerous, and I don't know what to do. 

Also, this is the first time in two years that I’m not happy living in Spain. I’m originally from Russia, and in Russia, it would be very possible to find a doctor willing to induce labor based on a psychological condition. I could also have had a tooth extraction at 20-25 weeks, which would have given me some relief. Here, I feel powerless; I’m trapped by these laws, and everyone seems to be ignoring my fears. I honestly feel it would be much safer for my baby to be out of me.

I used to be very calm and collected in intense or stressful situations. For example, I have a friend that gets seizures occasionally and I had always been able to deal with it calmly and thoughtfully. I was even told I should be an EMT.

Since my first panic attack, which was caused by something totally unrelated and separate, I get instant anxiety and start going into a panic. I am no longer calm, I have to walk away and calm myself down before I can even think about what I need to do. I am scared that this will happen at a time that someone really needs me. I’m even quite ashamed of it, feeling weak now. 

Can anyone relate to this? Or maybe even explain it?

i have severe anger issues, which have gotten better but back in june i broke down and ended up punching a brick wall as hard as i could a few times. the first punch it went tingly, like pins and needles. next one made it worse. then worse. i didnt care bc i thought it would go away.. ended up fracturing my hand, had a splint for a month or two i honestly cant remember. come now, it got really really swollen yesterday for the first time and the swelling went down with naproxen (i think? maybe some other med ive taken idk) but ever since ive got the splint off, ive been in so much pain in my hand to the point i cant even write in school anymore. i cant hold a pencil with anything more than the lightest grip possible, and i have to use the least pressure possible. this is not viable when i have at least 3-4 full papers worth of notes by the end of the day, usually closer to 6-7.

i have terrible anxiety, im not gonna vent about this but being at my house or even the thought of going to my house is enough to send me into panic attacks. i get extremely sweaty and burning hot to the point my hoodie is drenched and dripping in sweat, and my ENTIRE shirt is drenched. if i walk by my mom or grandfather are even in my vision or i hear their voice it sends me into panic attacks. im only mentioning this as my physical anxiety is constant, as in i can feel how tense every single muscle is in my body and the only relaxation ive ever felt was on substances, and not even things like alcohol or weed that used to calm me down and loosen my muscles up help anymore. instead, nothing does.

i need help. im 15 and had issues of substance abuse in the past/somewhat recovering, and i cant handle how much pain im in. i told my neuro, and my mom was in the appointment, and my neuro suggested physical therapy (apparently not really caring that my hands were trembling more than they almost ever do, even in panic attacks, and they only were bc of my mom). my mom just nodded her head and “mhm” until the neuro stopped. the second we’re away from the neuro she told me we arent going to physical therapy, and to do some stretches if i feel tense… and now she wants me off my meds like adderall bc she thinks its causing it, but its been like this since before i even started it. if anything, it got better after the adderall somehow, i only take 10mg for reference bc thats all im prescribed and i also dont want to be too stimulated. im just constantly in so much pain and i dont know what to do.

heres my question - i see my psychiatrist tuesday, and my neurologist i have to move the appointment up as its in like 6 months. i dont see a different doctor for god knows how long. i cant tell any of my doctors ive done this i dont think, but my friend was prescribed gabapentin and i vented to him about this and he gave me a 300mg capsule (i made sure  i saw the bottle & bag it came from, and ive seen it in his house before so i know its real gabapentin). i took it at night, and i was able to relax my muscles, my pain in my hand was gone, my panic attacks werent even panicky. instead, i went and laid down, and slept before 3-4 am (i was only up until 11 pm) for the first time in months. is it possible for my psychiatrist to prescribe me something like that or similar, for an off label use like anxiety or hot flashes or anything like it? i also am already prescribed depakote as it treats my bipolar and seizures, and i know it can treat seizures. ive also had family on gabapentin before and its helped them too. the other thing is my mom tells everyone i fake it to get a prescription. i was up until 5am last night bc i was so terrified, and all she did was just go to the bathroom a few times. ive slept 12 hours in the last 7 days because of things like this, and its affecting everything i do. i need medication, but she says i fake it or dont need it, and if she hears something is a controlled/addictive substance (my psychiatrist hasnt had issues in the past, he’s been my psych for years) then she immediately hates the idea of it.

tl;dr: chronic anxiety leading to constant tenseness and pain and extreme trembling, (i think) nerve pain in my hand that i fractured a little back from punching a brick wall too hard, but dont see neuro for a long time. can a psychiatrist prescribe me something for anxiety (even if off label) that also helps with the pain in my hand, such as gabapentin, if i have a history of substance abuse (not dependence, but abuse. i havent been fullon physically dependent on a substance before)? and, if i do end up getting prescribed something but my mom doesnt want me having it… what do i do?",2024-11-09 18:50:43

We got a new puppy in April and becoming a dog mom has been both the most amazing thing and also the most triggering thing for my anxiety. So yeah, he’s right it has gotten worse!

Also the Holidays are coming up which always makes me a bit more anxious

But also…he just doesn’t fucking get it!!! Like it’s not something you just “solve” like a problem. 

It’s a part of me…always has been. Runs in the family. 

It makes me feel like a burden. Like should I take CBD to mellow myself out?? I don’t want to take prescriptions. 

I guess I just didn’t realize how overdrive I’ve been lately. 

Makes me want to break down and cry and also makes me want to throw shit and break things because like excuse me for being such a fucking burden.

I will say my situation is somewhat unique in that I grew up with a single mother who became a hoarder after my dad died when I was 6.  It was just me, her, and my younger brother, and we lived a very secretive, us-vs-the-world kind of life, still do.  I've never really been away from my mom for long periods of time,  and always found it upsetting when I was.  It's definitely not the most healthy attachment, but she is all I've had.

I finally came up on a list for a rent controlled apartment near my job, and signed the lease last Friday.  I've been taking the move in bit-by-bit because I don't have a deadline, and I have always had anxiety around being alone and leaving my mom.  If I'm not careful, it tends to be a trigger for me.  For instance, if I'm pet-sitting for someone and I'm alone in their place I may spiral and have an anxiety episode that lasts weeks.

I've been very emotional and on edge.  I'm constantly thinking about what my new routine will be like, what it'll be like to go home from work and be alone most nights, being alone on the weekends. The apartment is so quiet.  I haven't triggered one of my out-of-control anxiety episodes yet (with the constant flood of adrenaline/panic), but I have to be SO vigilant about it.   I'm so afraid it'll be like this all the time, planning my schedule so I always have people around, running from my loneliness, rather than just LIVING.  I know I can invite my friends or my family around, but realistically I won't always have someone there.

I want to get a cat eventually, but I'm still mourning our previous cat who died in September, and it won't be financially viable for a while.  

I'm now dragging my feet on making the move, leaving me in this awkward in-between place. Does anyone have their own experience to share?  Advice? ",2024-11-09 18:37:57

I've run out of 'normal' topics to discuss.... please help. need advice!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gng1bx/dating_with_anxiety_due_to_cptsd_and_loads_of/,0,"I'm dating again, and recently this thought came over me... How long will it be before I run out of 'normal' things to say? It's hard enough being on the high functioning side of the autsim spectrum, but when you've been through so much abuse in your life too, I feel like it's extra hard to not scare away the person you're dating during those initial dates. I know the whole thing about if a person can't like who you really are, then don't be with them, but let's think about this in depth a bit:

  
1) when you go on a first date you shouldn't bring up any trauma you've been through or it will scare the person away. It's just not socially right to talk about deep dark things you've been through on a first date.

2) How long do you keep the conversations away from your trauma? In how many dates / how long of a time do you wait to start sharing and how do you start to share it, in a healthy 'normal' way?

3) What if you find yourself in a position where you've run out of the normal topics or are in a position where it's really hard to dodge telling the person at least a little bit about what you've been through?  
Examples:  
I) I don't have my family in my life because they're really toxic. Talking about family is a normal thing to do on the initial dates you have with someone... What does one do in the event that they don't have family? How do you talk about this with someone you barely know who you're trying to date / have an eventual long term relationship with?? Last night I just got done with date 2 and it's gotten really hard to not let the guy know about my situation.  
II) I had to get a restraining order against someone. This topic came up somehow. It was really hard to like, talk about it without getting too much into the details... I tried to 'censor' myself as much as possible. It basically stemmed from us talking about reasons we don't like all of our information online and why we value privacy. I didn't know what to say besides the truth, but I tried to keep it as 'light' as possible... I don't know if I said too much. Haven't heard from him yet...

  
4) I'm finding myself in the position where it's like I have to tell him some of the shit I've been through, because the surface topics have run out, and I don't have a lot or 'normal' experiences to draw from. I honestly don't know what to do from here... my life has been full of multiple instances of all kinds of trauma...  
  
Who here has navigated this successfully in the dating world? What did you do to result in being successful in this? What are the 'rules' I should go by?

I honestly am hoping for some advice here because I really like this guy and I'm afraid of scaring him away too soon. :(

Extra Question:  
5) How do you know that the person you're on these first few dates with is a good person and not a person who will just be another individual that will do you harm? What are the rules you can go by? What are the flags to look out for?

I saw a psychiatrist about a month before, was prescribed Zoloft but didn’t really felt I needed it (anxiety was only really happening rarely). I also had Ativan, which I took maybe twice over the month prior to the surgery.

Anyway so forward to the surgery, I woke up in recovery basically in the middle of a panic attack, one of the worst I’ve ever had. This was 18 days ago, and it’s been a really rough time since. I had some residual pain, so my recovery has been slowed by that, but the worst part by far has been the anxiety. I get crushing back and chest pain along with unrelenting restlessness.

I started taking the Zoloft almost two weeks ago at a low dose (12.5). I know this is very low, but I’m extremely sensitive to meds, and even this amount is causing side effects, like night sweats and insomnia. I take Ambien to sleep (again I know this isn’t a good idea but I’ve had serious sleep issues for other reasons). 

I’ve tried not to take the Ativan everyday (max dose I take is .5mg), although it’s really the only time I feel normal. My psychiatrist now wants to add Buspar, presumably to take place of the Ativan. I’m getting a second opinion, because I think the Zoloft might actually just be making things worse, and I’m really nervous (shocker) about adding another drug to this cocktail. 

Things feel pretty hopeless right now, and I feel pretty adrift in terms of how to attack this. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",2024-11-09 11:57:08

Growing up I was abused by my alcoholic step father. He basically made me scared for my life growing up everyday. Everytime I heard footsteps in our home, I’d panic. Especially when I heard him coming downstairs. 

I had a lot of anxieties growing up, being afraid to approach people, being too afraid to go out in public for a long time. I had lots of therapy and counselling. 

In school I was permitted extra time to do tests because I talked to a doctor about my anxiety and time stress, and how it makes my mind go blank.

I get these intrusive thoughts constantly when I’m anxious and it’s almost like my brain is on repeat, focusing on one part of a song or focusing on one type of anxiety. 

I feel there is “noise” in my head when focusing talking to others.. things like when they talk to me my brain trials off and I keep reminding myself to focus. 

Whenever anyone touches me I jump, and every time I get anxious about anything my body heats up and I sweat a lot, if I’m wearing a jacket I always need to take it off for a moment. 

Most nights my heart rate will not rest and feels like I went for a run, beating so much in my chest. 

Now I’m really second guessing myself.. do I have permission to say I have GAD? Am I trying to convince myself I have a problem? 
I was diagnosed in school but I feel this isn’t just related to school itself. And I wonder if this gives me permission to say I am still dealing with this.

I feel I have a hard time allowing myself to take this label or diagnosis because I grew up being told I was a baby for complaining or speaking up. 

Anyone relate or have any of these symptoms?

Maybe it was because of accumulated stress, but I had a sudden fear of dying from a heart attack or having a stroke. I felt pain in my chest, my arms were numb and I was hyperventilating. That happened 2 more times.

Although it has been a while since it has happened to me, I was left with the fear of having one of those attacks again. I usually feel pins and needles in my chest and I'm overcome with fear.

I'm sorry if my story isn't that coherent but I tried to express what I have felt in one way or another. I'm not asking anything specific, I just want to vent a little and maybe get some support, thanks for reading.",2024-11-09 17:26:55
Anxiety,1gnf4cy,Was this a seizure or panic attack? Weed related,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gnf4cy/was_this_a_seizure_or_panic_attack_weed_related/,10,"I’ve had bad panic attacks all my life, light headed, sweating, vomiting, gagging, heart rate the normal stuff.

But occasionally, when i smoke my first time of the day, it triggers an effect similar to panic attacks. High heart rate, and light headed mostly. Also this feeling like all my muscles are tense and firing

This time i had it much worse. I was fully aware and still mostly able to control myself and bring myself to my bed so i don’t think it was a seizure. For 10-15mins while conscious all the muscles in my entire body was just tense and firing all at once. It was extremely painful but i was still in bodily control. It felt so bad i wanted to d*e . My arms legs and core all “involuntarily” tensing but i wasnt swinging around or anything. Still pretty coherent . As if i was flexing everything at once. 

It felt more like an intense panic attack but the muscle tension freaked me out.

Or socially related for example at work : I work as a cleaner in a school and for some reason get worried about the teachers seeing me and getting mad at me even though I literally work there and they are all nice to me when they see me.

Anxiety,1gne4cl,Battle of Medications,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gne4cl/battle_of_medications/,0,"Hello all, I’m a 24 year old with a history of GAD / minor OCD. Throughout high school I was on Prozac (an SSRI) for my anxiety and it worked with getting through my symptoms of anxiety (would get light headed and stuff). From 18 to now I’ve had little to no anxiety issues and have lived a stable life…

Well, 3 months ago I was put on a week long prednisone prescription for an allergic reaction. 2 days into it I had the first panic attack of my life, and stopped taking the prednisone immediately. However, the panic attacks didn’t stop, and I started to dwell / anticipate having them a lot. This led to me (I believe) developing an anxiety disorder again.

Because of this, I took the easy way out and hopped back on Prozac (20mg) via my PCP. Was on it for two weeks before ending up in the ER - Derealization, worse panic attacks, brain fog, deliriousness, etc..

 Been of Prozac for two months now and still dealing with derealization and brain fog which I didn’t have an ounce of before the Prozac. Not sure why it did so much damage my second time around, but either way after two months of no SSRIs I’ve become separate enough to try another…

My psychiatrist I started seeing prescribed Lexapro at 5mg. And the plan was to take half pills (2.5mg) for a week and then up to 5 and see what happens. Well I’m two doses in on 2.5 and I’m loosing my mind. I feel like I’m going to pass out, my derealization is worse, brain fog much worse, and feel very irritable. 

Not even sure what I’m asking at this point but what’s going on? Is it the meds? 2.5mg is such a low dose apparently. Am I psyching myself out? The feeling of passing out was very real and didn’t feel anxiety-induced. 

TLDR: is two days of 2.5mg Lexapro enough to cause worsening anxiety / brain fog / passing out feeling? ",2024-11-09 16:41:58

Anxiety,1gn7472,How your diet can influence anxiety,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn7472/how_your_diet_can_influence_anxiety/,4,"Hey everyone,

I just want to remind you how crucial your diet is for your mental health—especially when it comes to anxiety and panic. Our gut is often called the “second brain” because it plays such a big role in how we feel emotionally. The saying “you are what you eat” really holds a lot of truth.

I’ve struggled with panic attacks myself, but when I pay attention to my diet, focus on healthy foods, and drastically cut down on sugar, I find that in situations where I’d usually feel anxious, I’m much calmer and more relaxed.

Unfortunately, the gut’s role in mental health is often overlooked, even by many psychologists and psychiatrists. The science around this connection is still developing, and many mental health professionals were trained before this became widely known.

So give yourself a boost by learning more about the gut-brain connection—you might be surprised by how much better you feel! ❤️",2024-11-09 10:17:37

Refuses therapy because “what would he get out of it when nothing is wrong?” and gets defensive when anyone has tried to talk to him about it. 

We have an uncle who is obsessed with doomsday and the idea of prepping. He has no survival skills and it’s more like anxiety purchases of survival items or extra food supplies which have inevitably gone bad because it’s generally more perishable goods of what he typically buys vs. longer shelf life items. 

He believes he will be in the first wave of people “taken” due to being neurodivergent (self-diagnosed autistic). We live in california outside of San Francisco and have tried to reason with him that the state is generally safe compared to the rest of the country and he’s well-positioned to leave the country if signs point to things going bad.

Our grandparents were also wealthy and left him enough to live off of (combined with his own investments) so right now he doesn’t work but lives comfortably. His kids are spread over the country and I’m the closest to him. Point being: all he needs to do is sit at home and watch the doom spiral of social media with no one and no animals to care of and no other responsibilities to worry about. 

We’re all very worried about him and we don’t know how to help. He has even started making excuses to not have our weekly dinner and we haven’t seen him in weeks which is concerning because he has no friends either. 

We believe therapy is the best option, but he refuses. He wants to move to another country where it’s “safe,” but given how much worse his paranoia has become with even some family connection, as he isolates more we fear it’ll get worse. Additionally, anytime he visits another country (in the states as well actually), he gets anxiety about the unknown of that place and ends up coming home early. ",2024-11-09 14:56:50

My therapist suggested that i come up with a mantra to tell myself in times of anxiety whenever I cannot immediately address the problem. I tend to obsess and over-research whenever I am having anxiety about something (usually health-related). I struggled to think of one, and googling didn’t help. 

I wanted one that was:
- Accepting of the problem,
- Did not dismiss it immediately or directly procrastinate it (like ‘It is what it is’ or ‘I’ll deal with it later”
- Did not make me feel egotistical/egocentric/self-absorbed (like ‘I can do it’, I have low self worth and confidence)
- Emphasized my capacity to handle the issue in the moment (with “as i’m able”)
- Focused on the process instead of the result (“with patience and care”)
- And was easy to remember and flowed well. 

I will admit I used ChatGPT to help me with this, and with my requirements we settled on “With patience and care, as I’m able” and I thought that worked well, and figured i might share it incase it could help others, and see if anyone had any other suggestions. ",2024-11-09 14:45:24

First time posting here.
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. It's 3am, once again I'm restless, anxious and can't fall asleep. For a year, I was smoking pot nightly, right before bed, to help calm me enough to rest, otherwise I couldn't stop thinking and my legs felt like they were full of trapped energy, which made me either violently slam my legs into the bed, disturbing my partner, or I'd get up and pace the house, frustrated beyond belief.. pot was the only thing that really helped. More recently, I've been feeling like I can take the biggest, deepest breath, and it feels like I am still out of breath, it's not satisfying at all. I've read this is sometimes referred to as air hunger and can be an anxiety side affect. But, my brain is telling me I've got lung cancer, as I vape, too. Panicked, I stopped smoking weed entirely and cut nicotine or of my vape juice in hopes of stopping altogether ASAP, about two weeks ago. 

I've hardly slept more than 3 hours at a time, or in a night, since. Still getting the ""gasping"" feeling, though there were a few days where it was almost not there at all. But my legs are back to buzzing, the sleep deprivation is beginning to affect my emotional responses at work, so last night I broke and smoked a small amount before I went to bed. Slept through the night no problem. It was glorious.

All day today, the ""shortness of breath"" feeling has had me totally freaked out. I also got written up today, the first time in the entire 4 years of my job. I'm starting to lose control of my life, there's a lot of other stuff happening behind the scenes that would make this post WAY too long .. I've been trying to get a therapist since March. Leaving voicemails and emails, with public AND private clinics. I never get a call back.d But I'm so scared that I've got something wrong with my health as a result of smoking and I dont want to touch it anymore. But nothing else works. Not sleepy teas, or OTC sleeping pills, or even alcohol (unless it's in a very large quantity, which I can hardly stomach... I hate the taste of alcohol), or meditation. Walks before bed can't really happen duev to the neighborhood I live in being quite dangerous. I've also tried prescribed trazadone, Nada. I want to scream, or die, or something. I don't really know what to do anymore. My legs are buzzing, I'm sweating, short of breath, my whole body feels coiled up under pressure. What if I can never breathe right again because I didn't stop smoking soon enough? But what if I can never sleep well again, because I'm not smoking? 

Our healthcare system has failed me more than I can count in the last 3 years and I'm scared I'll be stuck in this loop forever. But I don't think they'll even entertain my worries if I go in asking them to check my lungs to make sure it really IS just anxiety. We hardly have the doctors to deal with ACTUAL cancer.

Anyone else gone through something like this? I need help, I feel I'm going to break soon. I just want to sleep like a normal person.",2024-11-09 10:44:05

ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO KIDS AND DONT KNOW IT?????” 

now I’m no stranger to intrusive thoughts and I’ve had them since I was a kid (worrying about the inevitable heat death of the universe, panicking that I didn’t know what happened to my consciousness after I died, worrying that I was secretly somehow attracted to my brother etc) but this one really punched me in the stomach with the dreadful feeling it inspired that I was secretly this horrible monster waiting to happen.

Now of course I know that these are just intrusive thoughts that have no bearing on reality but I was just wondering if anybody else has had this happen to them? I guess I just don’t want to feel completely crazy lol

All my live I have been riddled with anxiety and it really has had me in a chokehold for many, many years. The last 3 years of my life had been the darkest and it truly seems surreal I can look back on it and SEE it and am starting to understand it for what it is. It really had full control of me, my mind, my body, my thoughts, my voice and the choices I made. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I’m starting to really see it and most importantly feel it. Medication and therapy did kickstart this for me and the most awful times turned into just about bearable but life still wasn’t enjoyable, it gave me that tiny bit of mental strength to begin questioning “what is happening? Why is this happening? Is this really me?”. These questions initially scared me and my mind was telling me all the wrong answers to them, trying to instil false reasoning like… Im just born this way or it’s because of what I’ve witnessed, how I’ve been treated, there’s nothing I can do I’m stuck like this and I’ve just gotta bear with it for however long till I meet my demise. This is all not true and I’m really starting to realise and believe all these reasons of “why am I like this” was all something in me that was bigger, stronger and something I was simply identifying with involuntarily. My mind had tricked me for years controlling my emotions, reactions what I think, how I see things and how I should represent myself, I just wasn’t the real me that I was tricked into believing. It took me a very long time to reach this point but there is a you that’s in there, it just needs to be accessed. A major factor in this turning in a more positive direction has been reading and talking to people who have unlocked their real ‘being’. A book I can massively thank and couldn’t suggest more is ‘The Power of Now’. Reading many posts on here I can whole heartedly relate to the many of people that are struggling with their own battle with anxiety and depression. I wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone like its begging to help me, I’ve still got a long way to go but I’ve finally started to get on a road that I’m moving down and wouldn’t wish any of what I’ve experienced on a soul in the world. I realised it was only me that can change this and no other intervention was just going to solve any of my problems. It starts with you. Thankyou for taking time to read and I hope you’re doing well!

I’m extremely paranoid since some time already. 

I was in Istanbul 2 months ago and 2 cats scratched me, one which didn’t bleed and one who showed a bit of blood but like superficial blood. I was feeding them, they didn’t attack out of the blue, they were asking for more food.

I got the tetanus vaccine.

Been having weird throat sensations like random sharp pains and lots of neck tension since getting back from the trip which now accentuated. Throat Doesn’t hurt in general or when I swallow, and no fever.

Brain zaps and ofc the typical muscle twitches around the body although it’s not the first time I had these ones. 

Now I woke up and part of my lip is somewhat numb of our the blue. I’m extremely scared this may be the paralytic one 😭😭

In the area of one of these cats there was 1 kitten and 1 cat who didn’t look in good shape, one was drooling but definitely looked older and I saw him drooling for some days, being quiet and not agitated or weird, I think dental problems.

I felt like it was indicative that it wasn’t my time. They went with someone else. I had moved on and was content with at least putting my name in the hat.

Everything changed on Wednesday.
I got notified I moved onto the next stage of the interview process and was given the pre-interview assignments. Suddenly, I felt the biggest pit in my stomach. I didn’t understand the questions. The more I thought about the job, I delved into a panic attack. I didn’t eat much. I cried so much. I felt like my world was ending. I got feedback from a few other upper managers at my job and I got a variation of ‘do what’s right for you, but what’s the harm in doing the assignments?’… and after a while I started to agree with them. I thought to try to do the assignments, but when I tried all the panic attack feelings came back. I felt so much dread. I just couldn’t do it. I think there’s something to be said about feeling this way about a job I don’t even have and there’s no guarantee I would get it. 

I don’t think it’s wrong acknowledging that it’s not the right fit, that I’m content in my current position, and I don’t want to move up the ladder at this moment in time. But I struggle with being a people pleaser and the feeling like I let people down. And that’s what I felt like, I felt like I was letting those around me down for not going for it. But I had to do what’s right for me. 

I let the proper personnel know that the job was not a good fit for me, I thanked them for the opportunity, and I wished them all the luck in finding the best candidate. I got a response from a top management telling me they understood, but they really encouraged me to do the assignment, that my background would help me and it’s supposed to be difficult. 

And all those feelings of feeling like I let someone down came back up. I don’t want to leave this place. It’s not perfect, but I don’t hate my job. I’m content, I have a good group of people around me. It just doesn’t feel right to change jobs. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. My biggest fear is what if I get this job, but six months in I realize it wasn’t a good fit, but I can’t go back to my old job. 

Deep down I know I’m doing the right thing, but that weight on my chest just won’t leave. ",2024-11-09 03:21:54
Anxiety,1gn0w7u,Trouble dealing with constant anxiety,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn0w7u/trouble_dealing_with_constant_anxiety/,4,"these past few months my anxiety has been getting worse by the day and it's getting scary. It's gotten to the point now where I'm anxious as much as I'm awake. to deal with the anxiety I had a year ago I started smoking weed and I've been doing so every single day for about 10 months. cannabis has been the only thing that truly helped me deal with my anxiety through daily life. however I clearly depend on it and I have enough reasons to believe it's bad for me but I just don't know how to fill the gap. I feel like nothing I'm trying is helping me, not the 5 different antidepressants that were supposed to help with anxiety nor the xanaxes or other benzodiazepines that I just hate taking, not the CBD, not the therapy, not the people around me doing so much to help me , not me, straight nothing.

Anxiety,1gmx7f3,Responsibility Phobia,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmx7f3/responsibility_phobia/,2,"Please be gentle - I know the following might sound ridiculous and pathetic.

I have started university but just the concept of the responsibility alone has seen me not sleep for days, relying on benzodiazepine use and waking up with a racing heart and gasping from stress-induced breathing pauses.

This then manifests as health anxiety. I believe it’s my minds way of making an elusive problem more tangible. I am in hell.

I am basically a recluse, and I have no friends and no direction, and I was hoping to give myself some direction by doing what I have always wanted to do via a university degree.

I used to work at a job that put immense pressure and responsibility on me alone, without providing sufficient training or support, enforcing up to 16hr shifts, and if things went wrong it was all on me.

This was three years ago. Since then, I have been unable to work, and I have battled immensely to find a new path.

I also went through psychological abuse throughout my childhood and currently, and I have a history of “Pure O OCD”.

I’ve always wanted to study at university, and I have always had a relevant interest, but I tend to get a lock on type thing, where I obsess and tear myself to pieces over the concepts of expectation and responsibility.

The paradox is that if I was mentally able to grapple with the course, it might change my life and provide direction and fulfilment.

I am shattered from no sleep, and I am angry with myself for being so weak and unable to see it for what it is, and take it day by day.

I feel as though I might have to postpone my degree until this rough patch eases (if it does).

Has anyone else had a similar experience, and how does one deal with the feeling of worthlessness and weakness?",2024-11-09 00:10:43

Anxiety,1gmqsp0,"What it means to sit with our anxiety, my take",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmqsp0/what_it_means_to_sit_with_our_anxiety_my_take/,3,"Hi everyone, been lurking this sub for a bit. Like many of you I found this sub while looking for answers, guidance, and support. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, it is something that started years ago for me. I went through an experience that I didn’t think was traumatic at the time but over time became the focus of my anxiety. I was able to live a pretty normal life though, but suddenly this year it began to seep into my day to day life and activities. Don’t know what caused it but it scared me, enough that I finally decided to do something about it and so I began the journey of learning about anxiety and how to truly address it. 

I have found many good resources over the last several months that have really helped me to understand anxiety a bit better and to develop a plan for tackling it. As many resources suggest I am choosing to face my anxiety which entails exposing myself to anxiety inducing things/places/events and sitting with and through the discomfort. I did not understand what it meant to sit with the discomfort, I understood the words but I just didn’t know how it would actually work. I tried it anyway and slowly but surely I think I kinda got it, but I wasn’t sure. I still couldn’t explain it or conceptualize it. Then it came to me while trying to explain to my wife and I think it may be helpful for others.

Think about a time you ate something spicy, remember how it slowly build up until your mouth felt like it was on fire. Remember that no matter how much water you drank it provided little relief. All you could do was pant and sit there wishing it stop. It was uncomfortable. But soon it enough you felt it subside, still burned but definitely peaked and was coming down. Eventually you would just go back to normal. Now the next time you eat something spicy you know what feeling awaits you. If you are like me you kept eating spicy and eventually you built a tolerance. You still felt the tingling in your mouth but now you kinda enjoy it. Food didn’t taste the same without it.

The feeling of anxiety can be overwhelming but it just that, a feeling, just like when your mouth is on fire. You sit with it letting it burn but it will peak and will begin to subside. It’s terribly uncomfortable but again just a feeling. I have noticed an improvement since I started this plan of exposure. What helped me too was realizing that the world was feeding me spicy food (metaphorically) regardless if I wanted it or not, so I decided that if I was going to eat spicy that I better learn how to use it to my advantage and learn to sit with it to build my tolerance. Hope this helps someone make sense of what it means to sit with anxiety like it did me. 

EDIT: If it was not clear, the spicy food reference is an example/metaphor for understanding what sitting with anxiety can feel like in terms of emtions, feelings, and sensations. Eating spicy food will not help cure anxiety nor have I ever seen any scientific source say as such.",2024-11-08 19:26:43

Anxiety,1gn4k2o,severe anxiety episode & ready to quit zoloft (sertraline) after the first dose,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn4k2o/severe_anxiety_episode_ready_to_quit_zoloft/,0,"hi everyone, this is a bit of a long one i apologize. i've been going through an extremely bad week with anxiety/panic and just need to vent (i think, but any personal experiences are also greatly appreciated and so helpful!).   
  
it all started with a spiral about dental treatment i need that i haven't been able to afford, and i had convinced myself i was going to lose all of my teeth. i spiralled so hard that it sent me into a horrible trauma state that i haven't been able to shake. i've been shivering, sweating, not able to eat or barely drink, uncontrollable crying, and feeling absolutely helpless with no way out of this feeling. the only thing that has helped me is by bundling up under multiple layers with a heat pad and warming up, and half of a dramamine if it becomes unbearable. i've had this happen many times throughout my life as a result from various traumatic events, but nothing lasting this long/worsening. i even reached out to a helpline it got so bad.

i decided to make a virtual doctor's appointment yesterday after 4 days of hell and could no longer handle it, and asked to try sertraline. i'd been on a few different SSRI's and even a mood stabilizer as a trial in the past for potential bipolar type 2 (i know now that isn't what i have) but never tried sertraline, and after some research, i felt like it had good reviews as well as little side effects. the doctor was absolutely lovely and even gave me her number if i needed (which i didn't get a chance to write down and i'm kicking myself for). she prescibed me sertraline 25mg for 1 week with the option to increase if i felt i could/wanted/needed to and to check-in in 2 weeks. i took it last night (my sleep is quite backwards right now), and within an hour i honestly felt so much better. my anxiety had calmed down, i felt sleepy and contently out of it/spaced out. this made me feel so hopeful that i was going to finally have something to help me feel okay again. then, at about 12 hours after taking the first dose, i began what was going to be a horrible next 12 hours to follow-- extreme irritability to the point i wanted to climb out of my skin, so i forced myself to sleep and when i woke up, my stomach felt weird and i was nauseous which then sent me into a full-blown panic attack (i have a severe phobia of throwing up thanks to my mother). i shot out of bed and took dramamine and started pacing to calm down, feeling extremely lightheaded and as though i was going to faint. i could feel my heartbeat so intensely throughout my entire body. my husband had just gotten home thankfully and was there to comfort me, but it was horrendous. this experience was obviously extremely traumatizing, especially as i was already struggling with my anxiety (funny how that works), and i am now absolutely terrified to continue this medication. as i said, i've been on quite a few different meds in the past and i don't ever recall feeling this horrible and especially this quickly.

it's now past 24 hours since i've taken the dose and i think my body is slowly starting to feel a bit better, but it's still lingering with bad depression symptoms as well now, and i just don't know what i want to do. i contacted my doctor but a nurse promptly replied and told me i need to make another appointment, but i just can't afford another $130 appointment right now. i have considered taking half the dose (12.5mg) and trying that but i genuinely don't know if i can get through another 24 hours of feeling like this, let alone potentially weeks until it levels out (doom-scrolling and reading other people's experiences was definitely not a good idea for an anxious brain, either lol). i feel like right now i'm going to take the weekend to see how i feel and then potentially schedule another appointment to try something else? i've been recommended buspar (busiprone) by a few friends and other people online so far, it seems to have little to no side effects so maybe an option.

anyway, that's about it. if you've gotten this far, thank you so much for reading and for allowing me a space to vent. i honestly don't even fully know what these ""episodes"" are at this point; whether it's my anxiety disorder, ptsd, or panic attacks/disorder (or all of it mixed together) and i know being reassessed would be best, but unfortunately that's just not an affordable option right now as i've just recently moved from canada to the us. i also wondered if i even actually need medication or to just allow these ""episodes"" to pass as they have in the past, but i just want to minimize the potential of having them at all if i can, because they are so incredibly traumatizing each time when they do happen and that is why i felt so desperate to try something. 

i'm afraid i'm ""too"" traumatized that there just isn't a treatment out there for me, or that i won't be able to figure out what's ""wrong"" with me or ever feel better...

thank you again, i hope you're all doing okay ♡

The problem is, she's going out of town tonight and I am so anxious about what's gonna happen and how will I handle my attacks without her. My parents are also out of town so it's just me and my sister and I can't really run to her during panic attacks 'cause she's diagnosed with GAD and seeing me having an attack triggers her.

Tonight, I was trying to sleep and closed my eyes but opened them because I wasn't able to fall asleep. When I opened them, everything was insanely blurry. I could barely see. I started freaking out because my vision was all blurred and my surroundings were hard to make out, so I started crying and hyperventilating. After about 5 minutes my vision was alright. Does anyone have any idea of why my vision was that blurry when I opened my eyes (my vision gets blurry sometimes but not to the point of feeling like I'm going blind). I'm afraid that I'm suffering an eye stroke or something is wrong with my health, but google says it's just dry eyes while I was trying to rest. What do you think? ",2024-11-09 05:44:32

As a teen, my anxiety just gave me momentary heart racing, feeling of nervousness. Really just normal sensations.

Now, especially around my cycle, I tend to get manic almost. And my health suffers from it. And if I am happy, it feels so odd. Which increases the feelings of mania. Happiness does not bring me calm, only indifference does. 

When the anxiety passes, I have fatigue, headaches, weakness, weird bodily sensations I can’t quite put my finger on. Indigestion, heart palpitations, dizzy. Blood sugar issues even.

When I am in the middle of my anxiety, I feel very alert, lots of energy, like I can do anything (physically that is). I start getting really anxious about my health, and have not tried medication for those reasons as well. Been to therapy, I understand all my thoughts too well unfortunately.

What changed? Why does my body not tolerate stress anymore? Why is it not used to it when I go through this everyday? And I always seem to crash afterwards or is it something else healthwise? I’m just.. anxious lol I’m actually slowly destroying myself with my own thoughts and by the time I’m 35 I’ll be a goner

So, I generally struggle with anxiety, OCD and insomnia. The past 2.5 months my sleep has been a lot better, same for my OCD and anxiety but since the past week, I've started to struggle again. Today specifically was a very stressful OCD day and I was having intrusive thoughts on a massive level all day and I could not deal with them as well as usual.

That's where I'm still at. I'm laying in bed, trying to sleep and distract myself but my mind is not shutting off. I've been trying my coping methods to think about something positive, or distract myself by watching a show and do my usual bedtime routine but I'm still clearly affected by my ongoing anxiety today and now don't know how to shut it off for sleep. 

My sleep anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked in an hour or so before bed, too, which is why I presume I can't fall asleep right now. It's only 12:30 right now and I don't mind sleeping in longer so I can calm myself down that way but I desperately need my mind to shut up for that. 

What can I do to distract myself right now? I just want my mind to calm down x-x",2024-11-08 23:28:26

27, overweight. On 10mg per day of dexamphetamine (ADHD medication). Have been on adhd medication for a month or so. Before starting medication I would smoke marijuana on and off periods. Since starting the ADHD medication, I found giving into my addictive tendencies heavily reduced.

2 nights ago I had a little bit of weed. Had been almost 2 months since last smoking weed  which was a long period for me. Felt good. Went about my night playing some video games. Last night I intended to do the same thing, except I smoked a little more than the previous night. After about 20 minutes I started to feel disassociation. Like I was losing my mind. I went to lay down and bring with my own thoughts laying down just made things worse.
I started to freak out, breathing heavily, heart racing. My heart started to feel like it was going to burst out of my chest. I thought I was dying. I honestly feel like it was the closest I've ever been to death. Started questioning my life, wa so upset and ashamed that this is how I was going. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving my pregnant wife behind.  Felt like my life was flashing before my eyes. Eventually it settled, I calmed down. I was worried I was having a heart attack, and debated calling an ambulance. I convinced myself that how I'm feeling is just amplified due to the weed, so decided to wait it out and think about wtf happened coherently the next morning. 

It is now the next day, about 18 hours since. I still have chest pain but feel like it comes on more when thinking about last night.

I'm scared. Was it a panic attack? I think it was but what if it was a heart attack?  I just feel like my brain is all over the place and don't know what to do.",2024-11-09 04:18:34

Anxiety,1gn1slb,First timer anxiety / panic attack,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn1slb/first_timer_anxiety_panic_attack/,0,"I would like to go see a doctor - but it’s Saturday morning and my usual GP I go to only opens on Monday. Should I go to a different GP just to get help or should I wait it out to go see a doctor that knows my history? 

A little backstory. I have been suffering with chronic muscle pain for years. (12 years to be accurate) I have seen multiple doctors and specialists regarding this and they’re still trying to pin point what exactly is the matter. Note that I have only actively started looking into/treating the muscle pain for the last 5 years. And I can only afford to see a specialist once a year max so it is a slow progress.

Now these passed three weeks I have been noticing signs of anxiety. Tight chest, numb feeling - which are also symptoms of my chronic muscle pain. Buttt I also started getting really angry and irritated for no reason, I started feeling dizzy all the time and the tight chest felt more like a tight heart than the usual tight chest I get from my chronic pain. 

So last night, my fiancé wanted to go shower, and I switched off the geyser to save electricity. This is a common thing for us to do. He got a little irritated because getting out of a cold shower, even if it’s a common thing for us to do to switch off the geyser, you really hate yourself a bit for not checking if the geyser was on. When I say he got a little irritated, I really mean a LITTLE, his reaction was minor and it completely tipped me over. 

I started with a cramp to the side of my rib cage, which is also common with my chronic pain, however this cramp/spasm felt minor to what I’m usually used to. Shortly after the cramp/spasm my heartbeat started rising and I got even dizzier and a bit more shakier. I immediately started crying and I didn’t understand why I was crying. I started getting irritated for being silly for crying for no reason and then I started to struggle to breath and this set off another sense of panic and overwhelmingness.

A little while after I realised this may be a panic/anxiety attack and I need to calm myself down. I tried getting my breathing under control and I would eventually start breathing fine but still left traumatised. A little after that the breathing situation would flare up again and then I had to try and relax and focus on my breathing. This happened approximately 9-11 times within the next 90minutes or so… I was obviously not concerned about time or keeping a tally during this time. 

I obviously spent a bit of time on google after I managed to stay calm and breath normally again and most articles recommended seeing a doctor to make sure it was in fact and anxiety/panic attack and not some other underlying issue. Now the problem is that I know I have chronic pain and a different GP that’s not familiar with my personality nor my history might request a bunch of tests which could potentially lead to a delayed diagnosis and/or unnecessary expenses (the unnecessary expense part is pretty important for me right now, I mean we’re getting married soon and we’re paying for it ourselves). But also, Monday still feels pretty far away and I’m not even sure if I will get that appointment on Monday - there’s a possibility my doctor may only have an opening Tuesday or Wednesday. So what do I do? And if anyone has any helpful tips please send them this way, I’m scared to go back to that place of pure panic and I still don’t feel 100% comfortable to go by my day.

I’m not sure if it was the fact that my fiance’s nephew was crying, the parents arguing, or the driving around in circles trying to find a spot to eat set me off but I had a full blown panic attack back there. I needed to get out asap and ended up pulling myself forward into the middle row. We ended up walking back to the house after dinner because there was no way I was riding back like that.

Anxiety,1gn0hw9,19 years on Zoloft ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn0hw9/19_years_on_zoloft/,0,"I, 36F was disagnoized with generalized anxiety disorder and depression when I was 17. Since then I've been having regular treatment, have been medicated, had therapy and have lived a relatively normal life. That's not to say I haven't had triggers and that I never feel anxious. I definitely do, but I've learned to deal with it, or live with it.

Until lately. I'm not sure what the trigger was, if there was one. There were a few stressful things going on in my life, but nothing that I can look at as a tipping point. But all of a sudden I'm dealing with crippling anxiety pretty well 24/7. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't go an hour without having to cry or have a panic attack.

My main issue is my Catastrophizing - I can't seem to stop this self distruxtive behaviour.

To give you an example - my door started leaking. I immediately go to: the house is going to flood, the water is going to damage my home so bad that it's going to cost so much to repair everything that we are going to lose our house.

I've cried over this door, had panic attacks over this door. From a DOOR. If you're friends with me at all you've heard about this fucking door.

And when I have a moment of clarity, I know that my thoughts are irrational. I realize that some people are going through way worse times, and both myself are working professionals with steady incomes. THEN I'll start thinking about what happens if one of us loses our jobs and the spiral continues.  

I have an appointment with my doctor as it's seeming like I either need a medication adjustment. (Currently taking 200 mg of Zoloft, and 1mg of Ativan when needed). Or my medication has compelty stopped working - which sends me down another hole. When I've had flare ups before I've had medication adjustments - generally increases in dose. I'm now at the maximum recommended dose, although I know my doctor can increase it if she feels it's necessary. 

This doesn't feel as bad as before I actually started medication, but it's certainly one of my worst flare ups.  So Im thinking the Zoloft is still somewhat working, but it needs to be increased or tweaked or something. 

I'm wondering if anyone has had this experience, and if they've had any success with increasing Zoloft more than 200mgs or if their doctors added something else. 

I would also love to hear other people's examples of them catastrophizing, and anything you found that helped.

I'm currently out of Ativan until I meet my doctor. So any advice, kind words, or stories about your castrophiing would mean the world to me.

Anxiety,1gn088r,I went from loving my job to hating it,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gn088r/i_went_from_loving_my_job_to_hating_it/,0,"So I got a job last year at a retirement home working in their kitchen, and it was a wonderful change of pace from restaurant work. 
All the equipment was in great shape, my manager kept everything sparkly clean, and I was working with two older women, who I got along with pretty well.
One of them had some kind of learning disability and she and I clicked on a way I didn’t with the rest of the staff.
Well, a few months ago my manager left for her vacation which she had been planning for six months and she was out of the country.
Both my coworkers quit the week before her vacation and she had to bring an ex employee back who was an older man, very backwoods blue collar guy who definitely makes an effort to be positive and he is nice to me, but he’s a lot more easily stressed by the lunch rush and sometimes he goes on really bigoted rants out of nowhere.

So my manager left for vacation and it was just me and him alone together for nine days straight. 
During that week, the hurricanes hit the area we’re at pretty hard and we lost running water for three days.
His cousin died in the flood. 
We both continued to show up for work but I could tell he was losing his grip and one day he went off and started screaming at one of the nurses.
I started binging weed just to get through everything and when my manager got back, she seemed totally clueless about the kind of hell we’d been through and asked me about my new girlfriend and I had to remind her that I hadn’t seen her at all in two weeks because I was locked away in that building. 
My manager gave me an extra day off that week to recooperate but ever since then I just hate my job. I don’t wanna look at that kitchen anymore.
My girlfriend left me and I’ve been a depressed anxious wreck.
I got put on SSRIs this week, and I’m getting better but I still fucking hate my job.

I felt this way about my old job after Covid hit and screwed everything up and I was there for four years.

Anxiety,1gmzhad,Therapy is not working?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmzhad/therapy_is_not_working/,15,"Hi there. This is my first time seeing a therapist in person, after jumping around tele / virtual therapy for a couple of years. I’ve been going this therapist for 5 months but I feel I am not making any progress, and feel I am getting worse? What do I do?

I left a stable but stagnant job I had for 7 years at the beginning of the year. Got rid of my apartment, went to a new city to take a chance on a role potentially . However it was bait and switch and didn’t work out. I was essentially humiliated on the way out despite all the positives I accomplished. 

Now I am stuck somewhere where I don’t want to be with no friends, stuck in my families house helping their family business that brings me no joy or is challenging myself. Trying my best to rebuild my finances. I’ve never dated and incredibly lonely, but no making any progress there. 

I’m not getting tangible next steps from my therapist. Everytime I go in to the session I feel like I am going though a LinkedIn Job page with him, and not actually getting better.

What do I do?",2024-11-09 02:04:23

Anxiety,1gmzdsk,Im lost,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmzdsk/im_lost/,2,"So heres the thing.

Over the last couple of months, i've been fired from a job, misdiagnosed with High blood pressure, anxiety and a week ago my granphather die.

It all started in July, when they fired me from my job, because they couldn't relocate me to another place. And after a month my anxiety attacks and accumulated stress began, i went to the doctor and he told me i had hypertension. I Quit smoking cigarettes (after more than 10 years of smoking), quit soda and salt all together)

I spent 2 months taking Enalapril without feeling any physical improvement, but my blood pressure was always perfect. My aunt and uncle, who are hypertensive, told me to stop taking it because it was lowering my blood pressure too much.

I realized that it was not Hypertension and that it was stress. To all this, I have had shoulder pain for more than two months, I don't know if it is due to anxiety or because I sleep poorly. And honestly im so tired of feeling this pain, i really dont know what it is. And im so scared of going to the doctors.

After that, my grandfather had a stroke and I had to take care of him alone since my entire family was out of the country he sadly passed away 5 days latter

Now I have become more anxious than ever, I am afraid of dying, I am afraid of everything. I'm afraid to go out into the streets and feel like I'm going to die right there.

Any pain I have I feel like it's because I'm going to die, I'm tired of thinking like that.

Im having palpitations every night and everything is getting worse, you know?

Can you give a suggestion?

Thank you",2024-11-09 01:59:34
Anxiety,1gmzapf,Put on meds without being told they’re beta blockers?!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmzapf/put_on_meds_without_being_told_theyre_beta/,20,"I was diagnosed with anxiety early this year, I was shocked at the diagnosis but after research, I feel like I finally have an answer to A LOT.

My panic attacks and chest pains (what I thought were heart attacks) were the main problem as well as my overstimulation and constantly thinking the worst. 

I have a history with adverse effects on medication and therefore I am always reluctant to take them. When my doctor told me that she had meds to help I naturally had many questions.

The first was whether they would affect my brain chemistry as I didn’t want to feel “numb” and these tablets didn’t. They were sold to me as a dream, they only target physical effects or anxiety i.e. they help with chest tightness and generally calm me down. When I asked potential side effects, I was told “they may cause some stomach upset but that’s it”. Backstory, I have PCOS and suspected endo which causes me to suffer everyday with stomach pains which we still haven’t gotten to the bottom of. So why the doctor thought these tablets were good for me based off my records, I have zero idea. However, I was willing to take the risk and compared to other meds, these seemed a dream.

I was told take them once a day and don’t stop them until you’ve consulted a GP and you’re good to go. After a week, I was suffering even worse with my chest tightness and overall mental stability so I checked the leaflet inside the packaging (I know I should have done this before) and found that these were in fact beta blockers. Since, I have tried contacting the GP so I know I can safely get off these meds but I cannot get through to them for the life of me. 

Bottom line, I’m stuck on this medication that I wasn’t properly informed about and it’s put me in a state of mania and psychosis, not to mention worsening my symptoms. I have filed a complaint with the GP about this and other negligent actions but is this as bad as I think it is?? I know this is a lot but I wanted to give a back story so it’s understood:) 

Any help or advice is appreciated x",2024-11-09 01:55:10

I have been pretty anxious for a few years now, but I knew how to manage it. I even studied abroad for 2 years when I was 17 and I loved this part of my life. When I came back home to pursue my studies, it felt a bit strange but I kept it together and had a pretty full social life. Then I turned 20 and my life became hell. First I started having insomnia, then I just started throwing up randomly and feeling nauseous all the time. My thoughts were eating me alive and I could not tell anyone about it. That's when my panic attacks started. It was almost everyday before going to uni. Nonetheless, my life was perfect on paper. I am a sociable and conventionally attractive woman who just graduated from my country's best university. So I kept pretending for a few months that everything was okay and started obsessing over fitness to the point where I lost a lot of weight. I felt palpitations continuously and could not eat without feeling like I was going to choke on my food. I would feel hot all the time and start sweating excessively, which never happened to me before. I was a complete mess and could not face my reflection in the mirror, but nobody knew. I spent the summer doing all these medical tests to find an answer, then I faced the truth last month and went to see a psychiatrist. I got diagnosed with GAD, PTSD and OCD. I take 100mg of sertraline everyday, it's been 4 weeks now. I don't know how I got there. I used to be a perfectionist and a true workaholic. I was not scared of anything and always felt like I was special. Now I just feel like a waste of potential and a burden. I am screwing everything's up and I am relying on medication to stay alive. If there was a magic pill to come back to who I was a few years ago I would take it, but I know that's not possible. I can't even go out or take public transportation without feeling threatened by others. I kinda figured out how I got there, people were harsh with me for years because they thought I ""could take it"". Well, turns out I can't anymore. The thing is, I don't know how to get out of that place, and it's killing me. It's such a pity for me to say that my physical appearance is the only thing I have left, and I keep thinking about how it will one day fade away and how lonely I'll be. Maybe it's the side effects of my medication making my anxiety worse for a while, but I really don't want to turn 21 with such little hope for the future. No one around me seems to understand what anxiety is really like, so I guess I wanted to reach out to people who might understand my situation or who have had similar experiences in the past. Is there any chance for me to get better ? Is there anything I can do besides taking pills and hoping for the best ? ",2024-11-09 00:40:22

I swallowed a 100mg Viagra pill for the sake of experimentation. At first, the symptoms that appeared to me were a headache and I started seeing blue and green colors and my heart started beating rapidly. The symptoms lasted for two hours and I did not ejaculate. At that moment, I had a scary feeling. I felt that the left side of my body started to tingle or feel like chills and I felt that my soul was coming out of my body. I do not know if this was a case of fainting or death or high blood pressure. I went to the hospital immediately. They measured my heart. I had palpitations and my blood pressure was high and they gave me heart palpitations pills. When I took them, I felt better, but the next day the heart palpitations returned and I became more anxious and afraid for no reason, especially when I went to sleep. I went to the cardiologist and he put a holter device on my body for a whole day and took a blood test and my vitamin D level was 8. I do not know if this was the reason. After that, the holter device was checked. My pulse was 164 beats when exerted and 43 beats when relaxed. Then he gave me pills.  For the heart, including vitamin D 50,000, I started taking pills and the situation was getting worse. The anxiety and fear increased for no reason, as well as depression, and I had a feeling that I was dying. I was crushed from the inside, and the thinking, fear, and obsessions increased. Then I stopped the medications that the doctor gave me, called (ivadin), except for vitamin D 50,000. I am still taking vitamin D. It has been 3 weeks since I took vitamin D weekly. During those days, I feel dizzy immediately after eating, and when I go to sleep, my heart rate slows to 55, and I have shortness of breath and a feeling of fainting.

Anxiety,1gmn63n,I've never been anywhere more scary than my local walmart,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmn63n/ive_never_been_anywhere_more_scary_than_my_local/,2,"Sorry, this might be a long post,, but I really need advice. I have had alot of anxiety issues about our walmart. Let me give some context-
I have always had anxiety over walmart ever since I was a little kid. When I was about 6, my grandma made my older cousin and I go to the back to get something, as we were walking, a man flew around one of those shorter square shelfs, and hit me with his buggy so hard that the corner of the shelf stabbed into my side, he ran away and didn't apologize as I was gushing blood out of my hip. I still have a scar from it. 
So now I'm 25- I still unfortunately have to go to the same exact walmart and I feel like it's only worse... 
-We live in a city of 35,000 people
-Walmart is the most affordable grocery store in town (besides HEB, I live in Texas, but HEB is in an even SMALLER building  than walmart, and twice as packed because of the good deals)
-this walmart not only has our whole towns population at times, it has everyone who is traveling the major state highway that is right in front of it, and people who are from smaller towns like 20 mins away. 
- we live in a retirement city, there are alot of older people on electric scooters and alot of families who come in together and it makes it really hard to get around. 
-everything is always out of stock and I feel like the grocery pickup has alot to do with it (and also contributes to the crowds when they push around their ginormous carts) 

When I turned 18- before pandemic times, I had no problem with shopping in the middle of the night because at least thats an option for people who don't like crowds. Now that walmart isn't 24 hours anymore, my best bet is going at 6am, which isn't possible anymore because my boyfriend and I are sharing a car and he gets off at prime time, 5:30 pm and unfortunately, he hates it as much as I do, so we end up sprinting out of there with barely anything.

 We have used the grocery pick up before, but it's really frustrating when we plan out a meal and it's out of stock and they replace it with something that doesn't work for our recipe, or they just entirely mess up or order, causing us to have to go inside to fix it. 

I'm not delusional when I say they are so busy, I've looked up reviews for our walmart and others say it's so crowded or the layout is bad. Please any advice that can help me get through this. A walmart shouldn't be making me want to pack everything and leave this town because it's my only option to shop at, but it is because it's affecting my everyday life and I'm tired of being hungry because I don't have the strength to push through in there. It feels like someone is constantly on top of me or in the way or about to hit me. Please help",2024-11-08 16:54:21
Anxiety,1gmkw2a,Does anyone find time moves differently with their anxiety?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmkw2a/does_anyone_find_time_moves_differently_with/,6,"I (27M) have newly been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks, for the last couple of months. First attack sent me to A&E, have had several blood tests since, started therapy, medication and a plethora of other things. I jumped on everything straight away, and it all feels like yesterday. 

Here's the thing though, looking to tomorrow, later today, or even 10 minutes time feels like a lifetime now. Where time used to fly, I now feel like everything is taking too long. This is especially bad when I'm waiting for a phone call, for dinner to cook, or just trying to pass the time.

Anxiety,1gmvf74,Fatigue/energy spells? Can anyone relate?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmvf74/fatigueenergy_spells_can_anyone_relate/,4,"I notice, especially recently, some days I’ll be so tired and fatigued that I can barely think, barely brush my own teeth, and want to sleep all day. 

Then sometimes, I have a burst of energy or adrenaline for a day or a few and feel on edge, and the sense of having energy itself feels so strange & bizarre and triggers my anxiety. I start wondering if I’m going crazy, sick, about d*e, because I feel so strange.

The weird back and forth is so exhausting. I feel like my anxiety never presents itself consistently. 

For example, last week and especially yesterday, I was so fatigued that I didn’t go outside for days. Finally went out to get groceries, and boom, panic attack. I had to sit on a bench and cry it out. 

Fast forward to today, I feel like an internal energy/buzzing and I hate it because it feels wrong. It also doesn’t feel like genuine or “good” energy. I don’t even know how to explain this phenomenon. Can anyone else relate? ",2024-11-08 22:48:04

I got a double eyelid suture procedure done - a cosmetic non-invasive way for monolids to turn to double eyelids. It is generally safe because a lot of people have had it done with 0 complications. However, I am so afraid because I got the suture removed on day 4 of recovery, because I hated the outcome. Now I am fearing every single thing - infection, sepsis, dying, fevers, etc. Im so scared symptoms will appear like a week later (if its delayed or something.) 2 days have passed and I really don't know what to do. I cleanse the wounds with the saline solution and gently wash my face. (didn't touch it for the first 24 hrs) I know it is all anxiety but the fear that it is possible makes me sick to my stomach.

I'm struggling constantly with this. 

I recently was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Some days, like today, I don't know how to handle it. 

When I try and talk to people about it they always point out how other people have it worse than me. I know that, and it makes me feel like I'm pathetic or weak. 

I'm not sure how to explain to people that haven't had anxiety or a panic attack what it's actually like. I'm exhausted, and don't know what to do.

Like a pressure headache, buzzing in my head, dizziness, light sensitivity, shortness of breath, full-blown panic attacks.

I literally only have $200 in my bank account. I need to save at least $1,900 by the end of the month to pay the mortgage and HOA. I only make about $800 every two weeks from my usual job after health insurance and taxes. On top of that, I have to take multiple days off a month because of severe anxiety. I supplement my income with freelance work online, but sometimes I only have enough work to make $100 a week. Then Christmas is coming up, and I have to save around $400 for that just to get my family decent gifts and bring a few dishes to upcoming parties. Then 5 family birthdays are coming up from now until early January so that's around $20 minimum per gift for money I really don't have.

Or is it just me?,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1glw7yx/does_anyone_else_feel_like_talk_therapy_has_gone/,110,"I feel like when I was in my early 20’s, therapy was a much different experience. Therapists seemed way better at their jobs than they do now. 

I would have sessions that seemed to be “threaded” together better.. we picked up where we left off.. therapists seemed better at digging deeper. Idk.

I’ve been noticing lately that those things are harder to come by. I have cycled through so many therapists over the last six years because I’ve noticed that we were just shooting the shit.

I’d open up about some pretty big things in previous sessions and in the following session, it’s like I never said it. 

I feel like I’m doing A LOT of work to start and steer the conversations and give them something to talk about. I get that in the beginning, I have to do that but after 3-4 sessions, meet me halfway!

Also.. I do WEEKLY sessions.

And yes, I am very upfront with therapists in the first session.. I explain what I’d like to work on specifically and what my pain points have been with therapy lately. 

Idk, it’s just really discouraging when I really want to do the work and build on my sessions but oftentimes I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. 

I’m about five sessions in with my new therapist and she’s a hoot but she’s very unprofessional.. late, too chatty about her business and other peoples business, minding her phone during our sessions, and I’m prettyyyyy sure she’s a little high lol (not funny but wtf).

I’m gonna keep the faith and keep searching (I’ve tried different platforms, private practices, services through my employer, etc). 

Anyone else notice this lately??? Do you feel like therapy was a little more helpful and effective in the past?

TLDR: therapy has been shit lately. Can you relate?

it seems a panic attack after not having one in a while triggered my anxiety and took me to a state where my anxiety, for the past couple of months, has started to become almost debilitating. i can’t do any of the things i did easily before because i am followed by this anxiety cloud over my head at all times.


one thing that has been bothering me is how i see the people close to me reacting to this, especially my family. i honestly feel terrible because i can see my close family being worried about me because they see i’m struggling. i suffer from pretty bad panic attacks and my dad has seen me numerous times while having a panic attack and i know he’s worried. i started taking lexapro about a month ago but my mood still is very up and down and i have days where i feel okay and others where i get a panic attack and then cry for two hours because it feels like i will never be okay again. they haven’t seen me in a state like this since i had just experienced my childhood trauma.


what i want to ask is: how do i cope seeing the people i love suffering because they see me suffer? how do i reassure them that i’ll be okay when sometimes i can’t even believe it myself?",2024-11-08 22:15:33

I think I don’t want to be judged if I make a mistake like driving the wrong way. Because she got her license at 16 and has much more experience driving. I’m also horrible with directions and will probably need to have google maps up. While she has a great sense of direction and can always figure out how to get somewhere.

Anxiety,1gmu2uw,Therapists validating anxiety/intrusive thoughts,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gmu2uw/therapists_validating_anxietyintrusive_thoughts/,2,"Hiya,

I've been through a fair amount of therapists throughout my life and I haven't been able to find a therapist or style that fully clicks. I saw a comment on /r/AskReddit the other day about having OCD and ensuring therapists do not validate the anxieties/thoughts from OCD. 

I was thinking about this and I recall a therapist I had several years ago. I told her that I had some anxiety about eating in a restaurant alone, especially sitting in a booth and seeing the empty chair across from me. She told me that if it were her, she would have booked it out of the restaurant immediately. 

I think her goal was to validate my feelings about being nervous but reflecting on this, I have not been able to eat alone since then. What she said affirmed in my mind that my anxieties about eating alone were justified. 

I can't recall too many other examples but I've seen a couple of other therapists after her and I must have shared similar anxieties about other situations. 

I don't want this to say I am pointing the blame at these therapists, these anxieties are my own and my own to deal with. But I do wonder if these therapists have worsened these fears? If they were maybe at a 5/10 on the anxiety scale, talking to these therapists and having these fears justified bumped them to a 7/10. 

I apologize for the wall of text. I've just never been able to really reap benefits from therapy and I'm starting to wonder if I need to seek out a therapist specialized in OCD just based off that /r/AskReddit comment. I do have some OCD tendencies - obsessing about locked doors, the oven, the placement of objects. I am just now starting to question if these OCD tendencies extend into my general anxieties.

Does anyone else relate? Any thoughts?",2024-11-08 21:48:49
