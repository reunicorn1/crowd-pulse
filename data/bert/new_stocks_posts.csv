(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

The joint venture will use Rivian's existing tech to launch Rivian's R2 in the first half of 2026 and potentially debut Volkswagen Group models as early as 2027.",2024-11-12 22:01:38

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.”

**Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024.**

**Electron:**

* Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world’s third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States’ second most-frequently launched rocket annually.
* Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket’s debut launch.
* Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron’s most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5 ^(th) , 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch.

**Neutron:**

* Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation.
* Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force’s Research Laboratory.
* Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab’s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company’s Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing.
* Significant progress made across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket’s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia.
* Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

**Space Systems:**

* Completed production and delivery of two spacecraft on time and on budget for NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars.
* Selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth, a first-of-its-kind mission.
* Completed two new spacecraft for Varda Space Industries to conduct the 2 ^(nd) and 3 ^(rd) missions to return in-space manufacturing capsules to Earth.
* Executed on schedule against the Company’s $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency to build 18 spacecraft for its Tranche 2 Transport Layer program.",2024-11-12 21:22:44
stocks,1gpoc5u,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet",421,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpoc5u/waymo_opens_robotaxi_service_to_anyone_in_los/,106,"Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

But they’ve also had many huge successes partly driving this rise.

I’m wondering from someone who understands valuations whether the current price is still undervalued for the profit the company can make, or whether it is now massively overvalued 

See this article for example:

https://www.01net.it/rocket-lab-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-posts-55-year-on-year-growth-and-guides-to-record-revenue-in-q4/

I bought shares at 4.2 and I’m up 350%, but I bought the stock for a long term hold, but I’m now wondering if the hype will cause a huge drop and I can sell now and buy in after it drops for the true long hold.

But at the same time, I’m unsure if all the good news means that it isn’t just hype driving the price, it’s actually valued at 20$/share and was previously massively undervalued

stocks,1gpodss,Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpodss/netflix_adsupported_tier_has_70_million_monthly/,62,"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.

The company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”

Netflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.

Recently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.

Beginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

When Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.

Netflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.

Netflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.

Media companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.

Netflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.

Netflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.

stocks,1gqa9ht,Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqa9ht/supermicro_hold_or_sell_my_strategy/,3,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/4OEM4c1Bq9

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/bKcUEjlglR

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day. 

NOTE: Earnings release can be found here

stocks,1gpqebe,"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpqebe/deep_dive_into_ebay_the_rise_the_decline_and_the/,8,"**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",2024-11-12 17:38:12
stocks,1gplak6,TSMC Predictions,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gplak6/tsmc_predictions/,24,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis:

  
1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

First thing I did was buy some MCD during the Ecoli thing and sold it when it went back up (made $10) then I found this company Tetra Tech (TTEK) and bought 8 shares at $46. I did this because I saw they recently won a 12 billion contract with DLA as well as a couple other multi million dollar gov contracts. 

  
Price has gone up a little its only been a week or less but I'm confused am I totally misreading how stocks work. I would assume when a company starts making a ton of money the stock goes up. 

Obviously they havent earned that 12 billion yet but are these contracts not as concrete as they seem? Am I thinking stupidly about this? 

Another red flag is that in the last year it looks like the CEO and CFO have sold millions worth of shares.

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.

Boatwright, who has been at Chipotle since 2017, takes the helm as restaurants across the United States battle weak consumer demand in the face of higher menu prices.

In a surprise announcement in August, Starbucks named Niccol as its new CEO, leaving Chipotle under Boatwright, who has vowed to push the burrito chain to be a “global lifestyle brand” and expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America.

A veteran in the restaurant industry, Boatwright spent 18 years with Arby’s Restaurant Group before joining Chipotle in 2017.

He was named CEO following “a thorough and rigorous external search process,” Chipotle said in a statement on Monday.

Boatwright worked closely with Niccol to also steer the company out of a crisis following a severe E. coli and salmonella outbreak in 2015.

“Boatwright was by far the most logical choice given his instrumental role in leading Chipotle’s efforts to improve operations, integrate new technology, reduce employee turnover, and bolster customer satisfaction,” said Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair.

His appointment as CEO comes amid a slew of changes to the top brass at Chipotle following Niccol’s exit. 

In August, Chipotle also accelerated the appointment of Adam Rymer as its chief financial officer, and named Rymer’s predecessor Jack Hartung as chief strategy officer.

Hartung was originally set to retire in March next year after a little over two decades as the company’s CFO. Rymer has been at Chipotle for 15 years, last serving as vice president of finance. 

“Boatwright as CEO should build confidence among investors in Chipotle’s management,” said Jim Sanderson, analyst at Northcoast Research. 

Chipotle’s stock lost $6 billion in market value immediately after Niccol’s departure. Since then, shares have risen about 14%.

(2) Through new media and netizen cooperation, it is very influential on social media like Tiktok and Instagram, and develops marketing content and so on separately according to different social media attributes;

(3) Pushing new products by cross-branding with many brands (jeans, fast food restaurants, etc.);

(1) The U.S. and Canadian markets are very close to saturation, ELF is certain categories have been ranked one or two, like the previous substantial growth is unlikely;

(2) The international market is a vast space for development, but it is estimated that the U.S. market can not be achieved as high-speed expansion;

(3) industry EV / EBITDA valuation, for those with growth, generally at 25 times, ELF in 22, 23 years, respectively, 37, 46;
2, multiple parties:

(1) international market has great potential, by FY27, revenues will reach 1.8 billion (now 1 billion), should be given a valuation of 71 times the P/E ratio, the target share price is $250

 Summary:

ELF was founded in 05, fast fashion beauty brand, with the success of the new media marketing in the past few years, the brand influence has increased greatly, after 21 years, the average 50% increase in revenues, the market capitalization is also soaring, soaring from $500 million to $12 billion, back to $7.3 billion now.

The biggest problem with fast fashion brands is that they tend to rise fast and fall fast; to form a brand moat, they still need more than a decade of precipitation.

So the observation of ELF is mainly to see whether its hotness in the United States can be sustained, as well as the development of overseas markets;

Overall, fast fashion beauty, because of its low technology and high profit, belongs to the products that need strong marketing, and it is considered a good idea to use new media + Netflix as the main marketing method.",2024-11-11 15:39:20

Long time lurker here (26M) who is looking for some general advice.

I do quarterly rebalancing for my personal portfolio, though I offset it slightly (mid-Feb, May, Aug, and Nov rather than the standard end-of-quarter timing). This past quarter was a strong one—I realized significant gains thanks to the market’s recent surge (up 98% YTD), which leaves me in a unique position as I plan my next moves.

Right now, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. The market feels extremely saturated, yet I also hesitate to sit on the sidelines or try to time a correction. I want to be thoughtful about redeploying my gains, but I’m not seeing many places to confidently put new money to work.

How are others in the community building conviction in their holdings? It feels like I keep hearing two extremes: either people are incredibly bullish, riding the wave, or they’re wary of a correction—yet staying fully invested in names like Costco, which is trading at a 56 P/E.

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

Of course, these ups and downs due to the Gamma Squeeze won't change a company's long-term fundamentals, and with a share price below $300 TSLA is certainly a position to add to",2024-11-12 15:11:24

If you've listened/read anything from the most successful investors, all the red flags they bring up are being seen now.   When EVERYONE is so optimistic is now whats making me most nervous.  If you read about major crashes and recessions of the past, they are always precipitated with quotes from investors about how if you're not in the market you're losing out and everythings looking great, future is great,

Tariffs will be inflationary.  Tax cuts will disproportionately favor big businesses.  Interest rates are going down because the fed is reactionary. All of these have the recipe for inflation to increase again but this time squeezing americans to the point where buying stops.  It will also induce a panic in the market that might trigger a large correction.   Trump wants to increase local production which will help in the short-run, but his foreign policy is unpredictable so hard to say what oil imports will do.

stocks,1goqxi9,Is there still runway for $TTWO?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1goqxi9/is_there_still_runway_for_ttwo/,23,"For disclosure: I bought in TTWO at a cost basis around 140 last November after the official announcement by Rockstar about GTA 6. I am not looking to hold the stock long-term, but rather capitalise on the short-term wave brought about by GTA 6. My initial exit was 180, but the stock has reached this level almost entirely by the post-election rally, without much accounting for the catalyst I initially had in mind.

I am extremely bullish about the materiality of GTA 6's release on TTWO. Investors were likely anxious if GTA 6 was still able to draw the same hype as its predecessors did, but the official trailer on 6 Nov last year proved so. It broke the world record for highest number of first-day views for a non-music video, and is now the most-liked game trailer of all time. In response, share price increased by 20% over the next month as the market geared for more news. I continue to believe GTA 6 will be wildly popular with the general public - drawing milennials for nostalgia's sake and Gen Z (and onwards) who finally have a GTA title of their own generation.

For comparison, GTA 5 sold 11m copies and 800m in revenue within the first 24 hours. Analysts expect GTA 6 to eclipse 1B revenue in the first day, which already equals an entire quarter's worth of revenue. I believe these estimates are rather conservative, given how far the console/PC gaming market has advanced over the past decade. It is reasonable to expect GTA 6 to be a complete sell-out given all the reasons above. 

Last week, management finally gave us visibility of a GTA 6 release in Fall of 2025. This is already a bit of a delay given that management had previously hinted at a ""significant inflection point"" in 1Q25 which I had read as at least a pre-release. Therefore, there is a material risk that the company further delays the launch again; or worse, the product is a let-down.

I am wondering, if you think that the GTA 6 momentum has already been fully priced in on fundamentals, or if there is still further upside. ",2024-11-11 12:21:55
stocks,1go2cjl,SAAB - Swedish arms manufacturer,228,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1go2cjl/saab_swedish_arms_manufacturer/,51,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive.   
  
What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.  
  
I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet.  
Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products.

stocks,1gnos5a,Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications,482,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gnos5a/reuters_exclusive_us_ordered_tsmc_to_halt/,144,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",2024-11-10 00:57:47
stocks,1gnqxb5,Future of Energy Stocks ,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gnqxb5/future_of_energy_stocks/,97,"So I've been doing some research about energy stocks, here are some of my thoughts:

Clean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst. 

Any other thoughts? ",2024-11-10 02:53:52

> Wendy's supply chain purchases are handled by an independent co-op group that first tested Palantir's technology last year amid tight profit margins and increasing pressure from inflation, according to a Bloomberg report. The group is using Palantir's system to spot shortages and suggest solutions like placing an order from a supplier. Pete Suerken, who leads the purchasing co-op, said the system's AI learns over time and can suggest a specific warehouse, after considering factors such as cost and the probability of the items arriving on time. The software can predict when specific products will run out by analyzing current and historical sales figures.

> Suerken praised Palantir's platform and said it was ""so much better"" than spreadsheets and other customary inventory management methods. He also said the return on investment is ""significant."" Wendy's recently asked the supply chain program to identify shortages restaurants could face over the following three weeks and then staff trained the model by showing how the shortages should be solved. Wendy's purchasing group plans to eventually allow the AI model to manage smaller inventory and ordering tasks autonomously and without human intervention.

stocks,1govegm,US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1govegm/us_tech_stocks_will_push_back_against_eu_pressure/,61,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

I am looking at a company stock ticker CE. They are a chemicals company. The recent crash in share price is what prompted me to ""kick the tires"" on this name.

I am looking specifically at their balance sheet.

This year, they did not make enough money to pay off their bonds so they drew down 1B from their cash to pay off their bond. Now they only have 800m cash left. They anticipate that they cannot pay off their 2025 bonds and have already arranged short term financing to pay it off. Their debt coverage ratio is 1.4.

They are shutting down plants left and right to save money. They cut their dividend by 95%.

stocks,1gnaa1p,Diversifying my Portfolio (ASX),6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gnaa1p/diversifying_my_portfolio_asx/,1,"Hey all,

I recently got into Stocks last week

I deposited so far $10k into VAS Top 300 AU, $10k into VGS International (This one has been underperforming also tempted to sell it for another international ETF which has less companies in it any recommendations on ETF's of this type to look into?, $10k into NDQ Tech 100, $2800 into CSL and $67k into the S&P500 (IVV)

(Made a mistake with the CSL because it hae a weighting of over 5% in VAS but I am not sure if its bad to sell it for another stock because Tax reasons? Can someone advise me if I should just leave it?

I constantly hear some people talk about just putting all or 99% into S&P500 and then I hear the opposite argument of needing to be diversified in not just US and AUS but also WW and also even at what percentages you should have in each Stock

Personally for this reason I did put some of my Stocks into AUS and WW (As per above) but because of the past think the returns on the S&P500 will be better hence why I have overweighted it (I know the past does not have to repeat iself) but my risk tolerance is somewhat high being married at 30 with no kids and wanting to make my first million ASAP but I am feeling like maybe I have far too high a weighting in the USA is my main question, and if I do with my remaining 50k is it worth sacrificing potential returns from S&P 500 to diversify more? i'd love opinions on this because current plan is just to go ham on the S&P500

Do you all think this is a good strategy or I should really make an effort to Diversify more? Also I was thinking of buying VHY because I do not have many good Dividend Stocks yet, any advice welcome I only started investing a week ago",2024-11-09 13:38:00

(LYFT) shares this morning at $17.50 following their excellent Q3-2024 results. I had first started buying Lyft last month at $13.50.

Lyft demonstrated remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2024, posting significant gains in both operational metrics and financial performance. The rideshare giant reported record-breaking numbers in active riders and total rides, while substantially improving its financial position through increased revenue and robust cash flow generation.

# STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

**Excellent revenue, EBITDA and Cash Flow growth** 

* **Gross Bookings**: Reached $4.1 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase
* **Revenue**: Hit $1.5 billion, showing substantial growth of 32% year-over-year
* **Net Loss**: Posted $(12.4) million, including a $36.4 million restructuring charge
* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Achieved $107.3 million, up from $92.0 million in Q3'23
* **Free Cash Flow**: Generated $242.8 million, a significant improvement from $(30.0) million in Q3'23

**Solid Operational Achievements**

The company set new records in its core operational metrics:

* Reached 24.4 million Active Riders (9% YoY growth)
* Delivered 217 million Rides (16% YoY growth)
* Maintained strong driver engagement with record driver hours

**Strategic Initiatives In Autonomous Vehicles**

Lyft announced significant partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space, positioning itself for future growth:

* Formed alliances with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar
* Plans to launch autonomous vehicle service in Atlanta by 2025

**Strategic Partnership with DoorDash**

* Established collaboration with DoorDash, the leading U.S. local delivery platform
* Introduced exclusive benefits for DashPass members using Lyft services

# WEAKNESSES AND CHALLENGES

* Secondary player to Uber (UBER) in the rideshare market, only 30% market share compared to Uber’s 70%.
* Doesn’t have the secondary revenue stream of Uber Eats to absorb fixed costs
* Smaller market share and geographic footprint
* Limited brand recognition internationally
* Heavy reliance on incentives to attract/retain drivers and riders
* High customer acquisition costs
* Competitive pressure on pricing

**Wall Street seems to like it as well**

“We think the strong after-hours move is deserved,” Sanderson adds, and think the results will ease concern about Lyft’s ability to grow profitably. “But management’s 15% multi-year \[gross bookings\] target will still be a debate, as will the company’s position for autonomous vehicles.”

“Efficiencies are driving EBITDA ahead of expectations, and the profitability of the rides business model shined, even through increased investment into rider/demand-based incentives,” Morgan Stanley’s Nowak added, raising his FY25/26 adjusted EBITDA estimates by 9% and 2%, respectively, contributing to a higher price target of $18 from $16, previously.

BofA Securities also lifted its price target, now at $19, as the company has “seemingly limited incremental share losses, focusing on core customers and commuters that are still growing order frequency.”

“We have a Buy rating on Lyft as tailwinds from mobility/transportation recovery in urban areas are outweighing risk factors like driver wage inflation, inflation’s impact on consumer travel, and competition risk from Uber and new autonomous entrants,” BofA’s Michael McGovern and Justin Post said in their research note.

**Continuing to accumulate for 3-5 years.**

Lyft has a long way to go, but the first and second quarter of adjusted operating profits in a row and strong cash flow generation suggest that it is a serious competitor to Uber.

I had recommended and started buying Lyft in October around $13-$14, calling it an attractive GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price), and a very reasonable valuation compared to Uber, which is unlikely to have a monopoly in the ride-sharing market.

Lyft deserves a seat at the table and with excellent Q3 results and raised guidance it looks even more compelling. Sure, there was a massive bump from $14 to $17. post earnings but the valuation is still attractive at 1.1x sales for 12-15% sales growth and at 17x earnings for a 15-17% grower.

stocks,1gly6hr,Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point,1016,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gly6hr/federal_reserve_cuts_interest_rates_by_a_quarter/,120,"**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html)

*The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy.*  
  
*In a follow-up to September’s big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.*  
  
*Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first “no” vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision.*  
  
*The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market.*  
*“The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the document stated, a change from September when it noted “greater confidence” in the process.*  
*Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much a priority as arresting inflation.*  
*On the labor market, the statement said “conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The committee again said the economy “has continued to expand at a solid pace.“*  
*Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank’s 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of “recalibrating” policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation.*  
*Powell will answer questions about the decision at his 2:30 news conference. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the presidential election.*  
*There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households.*  
*Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the Q2 level but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed.*  
*Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.*  
*The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop.*  
*President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday’s election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong.*  
*Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair’s term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead.*  
*An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts.*  
*Questions have arisen over what the “terminal” point is for the Fed, or the point at which it will decide it has cut enough and has its benchmark rate where it is neither pushing nor holding back growth. Traders expect the Fed likely will approve another quarter-point cut in December then pause in January as it assesses the impact of its tightening moves, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.*  
*The FOMC indicated in September that members expected a half percentage point more in cuts by the of this year and then another full percentage point in 2025.*  
*The September “dot plot” of individual officials’ expectations pointed to a terminal rate of 2.9%, which would imply another half percentage point of cuts in 2026.*  
*Even with the Fed lowering rates, markets have not responded in kind.*  
*Treasury yields have jumped higher since the September cut, as have mortgage rates. The 30-year mortgage, for instance, has climbed about 0.7 percentage point to 6.8%, according to Freddie Mac. The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost as much.*  
*The Fed is seeking to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy in which it can bring down inflation without causing a recession. The Fed’s preferred inflation indicator most recently showed a 2.1% 12-month rate, though the so-called core, which excludes food and energy and is generally considered a better long-run indicator, was at 2.7%.*

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller.*",2024-11-07 19:02:19
stocks,1gms4ft,Are the NANC and CRUZ tracking ETF’s a good investment you're implementing in your portfolio?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gms4ft/are_the_nanc_and_cruz_tracking_etfs_a_good/,19,"With all the talk this election about congressional insider trading and looking at these various Saas and ETF options that follow US representative trades I was curious what y'all perspective was on these and if you're taking them seriously at all as a diversification play or if they are just kind of meme ETF's.

The NANC ETF aims to track the stock trades made by members of Congress and their spouses, focusing on trades involving Democratic members. As of September 30, 2024, NANC hit a one-year total return of about 40%, Whoa, which outpaces the S&P 500's gain of around 22% over the same period​.

On the other hand, the KRUZ ETF, which tracks trades by Republican members of Congress, has generally shown competitive returns but with less gains than NANC. 

Both ETFs seem to be a part of a broader trend in thematic investing that targets political market behavior which is interesting. Their management fees/expense ratio are both 0.75% which feels super high compared to like VOO (.03%).

These are both relatively new. And presumably could also be made obsolete if certain legislation passes that bans Congressional reps from investing while serving. 

Just wanted to get others take on these. Appreciate your time!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,1gm1b2f,Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm1b2f/airbnb_stock_up_8_as_revenue_jumps/,26,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

stocks,1gm1jo6,Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm1jo6/pinterest_stock_plunges_following_weak_q4_revenue/,16,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

Each customer like Volkswagen is \~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP). MBLY’s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028, MBLY’s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today. Meanwhile the stock is on lows due to near-term noise around weak total auto units industry wide, etc, creating a great entry point.

$MBLY is my next 10 bagger. In 2027, the stock will be $170.",2024-11-08 20:25:53

stocks,1glceac,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1glceac/qualcomm_pops_on_chipmakers_earnings_and_revenue/,10,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

stocks,1gl9i2e,E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gl9i2e/elf_shares_soar_as_cosmetics_retailer_raises/,17,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price rises.

Vanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.

In a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.

“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year. In contrast, SPY has seen $5bn in outflows. The $125bn gap between the two ETFs [VOO and SPY] has shrunk to under $50bn in 2024. Were that pace to continue, VOO would easily be crowned king in 2025.”

*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",2024-11-05 14:05:41

stocks,1gkgqx3,Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,50,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

stocks,1gk57du,Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk57du/oil_giant_saudi_aramco_posts_15_drop_in/,9,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.

View Comments

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

The company added 260,000 digital-only subscribers, compared with 300,000 additions in the previous quarter. Analysts expected the company to add 280,200 subscribers, according to Visible Alpha.

Heightened political advertising in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election helped the company’s ad revenue of $118.4 million beat analysts’ estimates of $116.93 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It reported total revenue of $640.2 million, compared with estimates of $640.8 million.

New York Times forecast subscription revenues to grow by 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, slightly below expectations for 8.2% growth.

Revenue from sports news site The Athletic, purchased by the New York Times in 2022, jumped 29.8% to $44.7 million from $34.4 million a year ago.

stocks,1gjfea0,The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gjfea0/the_overlooked_risk_in_ai_stocks_it_has_to_do/,49,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  
◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  
◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional ""data silos""  
◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  
  
**Investment Framework**  
**Key Questions:**  
◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  
◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  
◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   
◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  
  
**Risk Indicators:**  
◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  
◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  
◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  
◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  
  
**Portfolio Implications**  
**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  
◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  
◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  
◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  
  
**Emerging Players:**  
◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  
◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  
◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  
  
**The Long View**  
◾ The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  
◾ ""Data wars"" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  
◾ AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  
  
**Questions for Investors**  
◾ How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  
◾ What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  
◾ How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?

I hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI. I'm eager to hear others' thoughts on these potential market dynamics and data challenges in the journey towards general artificial intelligence. ",2024-11-04 14:22:37

stocks,1gkbipd,How will inflate your debt away work in a country like US?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkbipd/how_will_inflate_your_debt_away_work_in_a_country/,16,"I am trying to figure out if long term bonds are worth the risk in case future govt in collusion with Fed decides to keep rates low even if inflation is high.

Can anyone write play by play like how it may happen. I am going to try first below:

1. Say in 2025 inflation is still above 2.6% and economic activity points to strong labor market and GDP growth of 3% but still congress approves tax cuts for everyone at the cost of deficit. They also approve infrastructure projects costing trillions in deficit. But Fed continues to cut rates. Fed helps the govt fund it's deficit by buying treasury bonds if demand is low considering real yield is zero or negative.
2. Inflation goes much higher due to higher spending by businesses and consumers but Fed does not raise rates.
3. Say they tolerate inflation upto 5-6% while keeping short term rates at 3% or lower and forcing long term treasury rate below 4% because of fed buying them.

This will have the effect of debt being discounted every year by 2-3% just like how it has happened between 2020 to 2023.

I have seen developing countries like India tolerate inflation level of 10-12% every year resulting in their debt value getting reduced by 90% in 15-20 years, while their GDP keeps growing. Is it wrong to expect this from a mature economy like USA?",2024-11-05 17:02:40

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

stocks,1gi7s8w,SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gi7s8w/snowflakes_stock_buyback_and_shortterm_optimism/,20,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",2024-11-02 22:08:46

stocks,1gi2s7x,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gi2s7x/globalstar_and_apple_expanded_partnership/,9,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180% so far in 2024 as investors have seen the company as the primary beneficiary of the AI boom.

On the other hand, Intel shares have fallen 51% so far this year as the company struggles with manufacturing, new competition for its central processors, and the impression that it has missed out on the AI trend.

The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of the companies total market value.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html)

&#x200B;

*Job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020 as the impacts of storms in the Southeast and a significant labor impasse dented the employment picture.*

*Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 for the month, down sharply from September and below the Dow Jones estimate for 100,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. In what had already been expected to be a downbeat report, October posted the smallest gain since December 2020.*

*The unemployment rate, however, held at 4.1%, in line with expectations. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.7%.*

*In the report narrative, the BLS noted that the Boeing strike likely subtracted 44,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, which lost 46,000 positions overall.*

&#x200B;

*Along with that, the report noted the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton but said “it is not possible to quantify the net effect” of the storms on the jobs total.*

*Elsewhere, the bureau said average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, slightly higher than the estimate, though the 4% 12-month gain was in line. The average work week held steady at 34.3 hours.*

*Markets, though, largely ignored the bad news, with stock market futures poised for a strong open on Wall Street while Treasury yields plunged. The meager jobs numbers along with wages about in line with expectations help cement another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.*

&#x200B;

*The release comes just days ahead of the presidential election in which Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in what most polls show to be a deadlocked race. With the economy at the forefront of the battle, the light jobs number “casts a murky shadow heading into next week,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.*

*The weak October report also included substantial downward revisions from previous months. August was cut to just a gain of 78,000 while September’s initial estimate came down to 223,000. Together, the net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals by 112,000.*

&#x200B;

*Health care and government again led job creation, respectively adding 52,000 and 40,000 positions. Several sectors, though, saw job losses.*

*In addition to the expected pullback in manufacturing, temporary help services saw a drop of 49,000. The category is sometimes seen as a proxy for underlying job strength and has seen a decline of 577,000 since March 2022, the BLS said.*

*Another leading sector, leisure and hospitality, saw a drop of 4,000, while retail trade and transportation and warehousing also reported modest declines.*

*The report covers a month in which hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeast – Florida and North Carolina in particular – while the Boeing strike also hit what had been a vibrant though slowing labor market. Recent developments indicate that the Boeing impasse, which sidelined some 44,000 workers, could be near an end.*

*Prior to the release, job creation had averaged close to 200,000 a month during 2024, about 60,000 below the pace for the same period a year ago through still indicative of solid pace of hiring.*

*Some cracks in recent months have raised concerns at the Federal Reserve that while the year-over-year pace of inflation is slowing, elevated interest rate could impact the labor market and threaten the ongoing economic expansion.*

*As a result, policymakers in September took a step unprecedented for a growing economy and lowered their benchmark short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, double the customary quarter-point increments in which the Fed usually likes to move.*

*Financial markets are pricing in a strong likelihood that the central bank cuts by a quarter point at each of its two remaining meetings this year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision next Thursday.*",2024-11-01 12:35:15
stocks,1ghl0zv,Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghl0zv/etsys_declining_gross_merchandising_sales_from_a/,27,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.

I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.

I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.

I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.

Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.

Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.

The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.

As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!

I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.

Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.

Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.

For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.

I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?

And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.

I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.

Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.

The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.

Etsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",2024-11-02 01:06:14

I have finally been able to stuff over $25k into the Schwab brokerage account. Currently I have about $17k in stocks or ETFs and the remaining $8k in cash. I'm not going to start day trading until my transfer of $2k goes in so I have $27k and never have to worry about going below $25k again. My plan is to day trade a lot with this Schwab brokerage account and you all are probably aware to do unlimited day trades you need $25k in that single account. I read somewhere recently and I do not know how accurate it was that now you also need $25k in margin to be able to do unlimited day trades? 

Will slapping tight trailing stop losses on all stocks and ETFs affect day trading capabilities for other securities? 

And is there anything I need to be aware of going past the $25k mark and being able to now day trade all the time instead of the 3 allowed in a 5 day period?",2024-11-02 16:34:21

> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",2024-11-01 13:09:52
stocks,1ghe8m5,Thoughts on IONQ and SLI?,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghe8m5/thoughts_on_ionq_and_sli/,14,"Here's my analysis on IONQ

stocks,1ggtl3k,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,401,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggtl3k/amazon_ceo_pledges_ai_investments_will_pay_off_as/,76,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted
* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected

Intel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

As part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.

Intel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.

CNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.

The Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Revenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.

Intel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.

As of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG).. 

Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.

Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.

Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money? 

First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession. 

We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

I could be wrong which is why I wanted to get everyone's perspective. Are these two worthwhile to start a position in?",2024-11-01 18:37:59

The stock lost 15.3%, its biggest drop since May 2022, when it fell 19.5%. A broader market decline also pressured Coinbase.

Other crypto-related stocks fell as well. Robinhood, which also reported weak earnings Wednesday, tumbled 16%. Miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms slid 8% and 11%, respectively.

Bitcoin, which is often a big influence on the price of Coinbase, slid 2.78% to $69,918.66 after hovering below its all-time high of $73,000 this week.

Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, chalked it up to a temporary unwind in crypto-related names and called it an opportunity for longer-term focused investors in Coinbase and Robinhood.

“There is a lot that’s going to happen here over the next couple months – \[like\] the U.S. election \[and\] ramifications of that – that will be become the much bigger story for the space, not to mention the recent appreciation in crypto prices and volume could put upward pressure on fourth-quarter revenue if the trend continues over the next two months,” said Ryan, who has an outperform rating on Coinbase.

“Near-term, people will have to recalibrate a bit in their models for the blended take rate assumption,” or the percentage of revenue Coinbase keeps from a transaction, he said. “Nothing structural occurred here, but as stablecoin trading volume has increased, that comes at a lower spread, and the fourth-quarter implied revenue guide was a bit soft.”

Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer with a buy rating on Coinbase, put Thursday’s drop on the warning that subdued volume could persist going forward and that lower U.S. interest rates could cut into the growth of Coinbase’s stablecoin revenue.

stocks,1ggjotg,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,326,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggjotg/alphabet_deserves_a_better_valuation/,165,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",2024-10-31 17:13:27

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $0.97. Diluted earnings per share was $1.64,1 up 12 percent year over year when excluding the one-time charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision.

“Today Apple is reporting a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the quarter, we were excited to announce our best products yet, with the all-new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and remarkable features for hearing health and sleep apnea detection. And this week, we released our first set of features for Apple Intelligence, which sets a new standard for privacy in AI and supercharges our lineup heading into the holiday season.”

“Our record business performance during the September quarter drove nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to return over $29 billion to our shareholders,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We are very pleased that our active installed base of devices reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.”

Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2024.

Apple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on October 31, 2024 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call. The webcast will be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.",2024-10-31 20:33:02

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call with investors, Cavanagh said the company is exploring creating “a new, well-capitalized company owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks.”

The possible separation would not include broadcast network NBC nor streaming service Peacock, he added. NBCUniversal’s cable networks portfolio includes Bravo, E!, Syfy, Oxygen True Crime, USA Network, as well as news networks MSNBC and CNBC.

The company lost 365,000 cable TV customers during the third quarter.

“Like many of our peers in media, we are experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets,” Cavanagh said.

“We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we’ll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions,” he said.

Shares of Comcast were up more than 6% in premarket trading.

The comments come as millions of customers continue to flee the traditional pay TV bundle in favor of streaming. Comcast has been beefing up Peacock, which got a boost during the third quarter when it exclusively aired the Summer Olympics in Paris.

* FOMC focuses on PCE inflation in its quarterly economic projections and states its longer-run inflation goal in terms of headline PCE. PCE inflation has been preferred over CPI since 2000 for three main reasons:

1. The expenditure weights in the PCE can change as people substitute away from some goods and services for others
2. PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services
3. Historical PCE data can be revised more than for seasonal factors only

* There is a 94.6% chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut in November as of this morning after the PCE report, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That would bring the target federal funds rate down to a range of 4.50%-4.75%.

ENVX (Enovix) is an advanced lithium-ion silicon battery manufacturer, and is a first mover with it's battery. They already have 2 smartphone OEMs lined up for 2025, and they just finished their fab2 in Malaysia. They have a patent to protect their proprietary process behind their silicon batteries. They are the first to use 100% active silicon batteries in the consumer market. Competitors cannot just spin up a fab easily.

They are positioned to ramp up production in 2025 with profits coming in early 2026.

They recently raised $100m via stockholder dilution, out of their 168m total outstanding shares. This is roughly only 6% dilution. As of today, their share price has dropped 19%. The $100m dilution along with $200m cash on hand, allows them to survive for 6 more quarters at a minimum, assuming they still continue to burn $50m in cash per quarter, without *any* efficiency gains. That positions that well for the beginning of 2026 play. More partnerships, more customers, lower CAPEX, different segments of customers, will all drive the price up. 

Next-gen batteries and EVs and component manufacturers are a long-term play

The company previously released a preliminary report of its quarterly results on Oct. 22 and announced it was suspending its fiscal 2025 outlook. 

This report marks the first under CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company on Sept. 9 to revive the floundering business. 

“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. “We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.”

Investors are expecting that Niccol will share more details about his turnaround strategy during the company’s conference call, scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading on Wednesday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. $1.03 expected

Revenue: $9.07 billion vs. $9.36 billion expected

Starbucks reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales dropped 3% to $9.07 billion. 

The company’s global same-store sales fell 7%, fueled by weak demand in the U.S. and China. Traffic to its stores worldwide fell 8% during the quarter.

The company’s U.S. restaurants reported same-store sales declines of 6%, fueled by a 10% tumble in traffic.

In China, the company’s same-store sales plummeted 14% as both traffic and average ticket fell. Starbucks has been facing greater competition from local rivals, like Luckin Coffee, which can undercut the company’s prices.

**TL;DR** = Right now the market leaders in weight loss are $LLY and $NVO with injectable needles. $VKTX is also in this delivery mechanism, but showing better safety in their phase 2a data and got FDA approval to go straight to Phase 3 trails and skipping Phase 2b which is huge news.

**Oral Data Catalyst** \- Nobody likes taking weekly injectables, so an ""oral pill"" is seen as a gamechanger. Weight loss over 5% is a very competitive number and **over 6% will be home run**. This is a 28 day trial and not 13 weeks. Pay attention to **efficacy and safety of VK2735**.

**M&A Buyout** \- There are big pharma companies out there who are not in the weight loss space yet such as Merck $MRK and their **$25 billion drug Keytruda going off patent in 2028**. $MRK needs to shore up a big revenue source soon and the **wight loss drug category is poised to reach $471 Billion by 2032.**

Keep in mind $VKTX 2735 showed 3.3% weight loss at 40mg and safety profile similar to Placebo. However, Nov 3rd will show results from high dose cohorts **60mg, 80mg and 100mg**.

**$LLY** Orforglipron showed 3% weight loss, \~ 28% vomiting. 39% Nausea

**$NVO** two oral drugs

1. Monlunabant- I personally don't see a path for this drug. 3.3% weight loss in 28 days but here comes the safety hammer with drug showing psychiatric issues like anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances won't go well with FDA. $SNY drug rimonabant (never got approved) because drug was plagued with CNS issues
2. Amycretin- Weight loss around 4% (don't have the exact number) but safety profile is as worse as CT-996. Nause 75%, Vomiting 56%, diarrhea 18.8%.

**Conclusion:** For $VKTX the bar is to show weight loss 5-6% or higher to beat competitors and stay competitive with tolerability profile. In my opinion, higher doses will show weight loss > 6% with competitive edge on safety.",2024-10-31 13:06:40

The move follows a 16% cut to Dropbox's workforce in April 2023, which affected 500 staffers. At the time, Houston wrote that the cuts were due to slowing growth, economic headwinds and the need to invest more resources and head count into the increasingly competitive AI race.

Dropbox will be making cuts to the parts of its business where the company is ""over-invested or underperforming"" while working toward a ""flatter, more efficient"" team structure, Houston wrote.

""We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business,"" Houston wrote. ""But external factors are only part of the story. We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.""

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

*On October 24, 2024, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) sent the members of the Audit Committee a letter of resignation as the Company’s registered public accounting firm (the “Resignation Letter”).*  
  
*The Chair of the Audit Committee discussed with EY the reasons for EY’s resignation. The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*  
  
*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*  
  
*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*  
  
*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*  
  
*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*  
  
*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*  
  
*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*",2024-10-30 13:08:50

stocks,1gg9pmw,Capcom might benefit hugely from its next release,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gg9pmw/capcom_might_benefit_hugely_from_its_next_release/,21,"*Disclaimer: Capcom is my biggest position and has been for a while. I am a Monster Hunter fan. I usually just write about video games and have little financial insight. My video game insight might be useful, though.*

Capcom is a Japanese video game company that has been doing quite well lately. You might know them for games such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man and Monster Hunter. That last series is the reason I'm writing this up.

Capcom just released its financial results for the first half of the year and they don't look too great. This was 100% expected as their new releases were thin, but the stock price is still down. However, the next entry to Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Wilds (MHWi), is coming in February and I don't think it is properly priced in.

Monster Hunter is secretly huge. People into video games know about it and know it is big of course, but I feel they don't exactly appreciate how big. Monster Hunter World (MHWo) (the ""prequel"" to Wilds) sold 27 million units, those are Call of Duty numbers. You can bring that to 41million units if you count the full price expansion that followed a year later. Capcom still sold 3million+ units of MHWo (base game + expansion) in FY24. As of writing this, MHWo is the 23rd most played game on Steam, that is above games such as Elden Ring and Destiny 2 which both had big expansions this very year. It 's barely below Baldur's Gate 3, which released last year. MHWo came out in 2018 (2019 for the expansion).

MHWi will be the first Monster Hunter game to release on Steam on the same day as consoles, I believe this will generate surprisingly huge numbers. These numbers are made public on Steam and help generate a ton of hype. Media outlets just adore writing about player numbers. I fully believe MHWi will have a hype cycle similar to Helldivers 2 or Palworld this year, maybe not quite as strong as Wukong, though. This will establish Monster Hunter as a big mainstream franchise.

As opposed to Helldivers, Palworld or Wukong, there's actually a stock to go and buy during the hype cycle. I'm betting on people throwing money at Capcom.

**Why write this now?**

As I said, the stock is down, so there's a nice little window here. It might go down further before February, though.

There's a beta for MHWi going on right now. I played the game, it's a little bit rough, but I can at least attest that there are no major issues. Reception has been pretty good.

The beta was on PS5 until now and it opens to Steam and Xbox later today, we will have a first glimpse at the Steam numbers. I wanted to write this before we know those numbers in case in unexpectedly blows up. The beta is quite limited, so most players won't spend hours and hours on it, which limits player counts. I don't think it'll blow up, but there a small chance it breaks top 10 on Steam. Any more than that and MHWi is a guaranteed mega-hit.

**Risks:**

Gaming communities have become quite finicky and can turn on games in a dime. We saw this earlier this year with Dragon's Dogma 2 also from Capcom. It suffered a lot of bad press because of bad graphics performance, dumb DLC and some misunderstanding. It still sold rather well, but it could have done much more, in my opinion.

MHWi *will* have questionable performance (not as bad as DD2 and it won't be a bad surprise because we can run it ourselves in the beta) and it *will* have some dumb DLC. Now it's a matter of seeing if gaming communities decide to latch on to it or not.

**Bonus:**

Capcom also makes Resident Evil games which have been very popular. There might be an announcement of the next one rather soon, which might have an effect on the stock price.

**TLDR;**

Monster Hunter Wilds is releasing on February 28th:

1. It will be selling more than expected
2. The hype will propulse the stock even higher

According to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visa’s merchant sales and global digital partnership roles.

The report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited by Reuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands.

Visa’s legal issues

Recently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, in September 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network.

Moreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visa’s conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.

The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy pace during the third quarter, keeping fears of a downturn at bay while Federal Reserve officials eye further interest-rate cuts.

Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the three months ended in September, according to the first estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The consensus call among economists surveyed by FactSet was for growth of 2.6% in the third quarter, though Bloomberg's forecast was for 2.9%.  

Wednesday's solid third-quarter growth comes after real GDP growth was 3% during the second quarter and 1.6% during the first three months of the year.

While GDP is a fundamental economic measure, most economists and analysts believe Federal Reserve officials will use inflation and employment data as more of a guide when weighing their interest-rate policy decision at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

stocks,1gfm8o3,Volkswagen profit plunges 42% in third quarter amid sweeping overhaul plans,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfm8o3/volkswagen_profit_plunges_42_in_third_quarter/,61,"German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.

Operating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.

Vehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.

Net liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company’s net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.

Volkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.

Volkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.

Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a “challenging market environment” and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.

The third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.

Volkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.

On Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company’s management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.

In response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.

“Ahead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,” Volkswagen’s chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.

He added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.

Meiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $13.02 to $13.52 per share, down from previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.60 per share. 

Eli Lilly also lowered the high-end of its revenue outlook for the year and now expects sales of between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. The company’s previous guidance called for revenue of as much as $46.6 billion.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the period ended September 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

* **Earnings per share:** $1.18 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected
* **Revenue:** $11.44 billion vs. $12.11 billion expected

Demand in the U.S. has far outpaced supply for Lilly’s incretin drugs, such as Zepbound and Mounjaro, over the last year. Both treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its main rival, Novo Nordisk, to invest billions to increase manufacturing capacity for the treatments.

Eli Lilly’s supply woes began to ease earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration’s drug database said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Still, the agency warns that patients may not always be able to immediately fill their prescription for those drugs at a particular pharmacy.",2024-10-30 11:04:38

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",2024-10-31 21:07:01

CEO: ""This is why you often hear me say, it's a matter of when, but not if we'll become a Top 10 institution""

* I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one.
* We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms.
* Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed.
* Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue.
* We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student lender finance only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood.
* Our performance in the hard times is what gives me the strong confidence in our future. Today, we faced fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy.
* We continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. 
* We continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. 
* We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs.
* SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier and our beta testing a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months.
* In credit cards, we officially launched the everyday cash rewards and the essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people spending and borrowing needs,
* We shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue.
* We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years.
* Home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022.
* In our tech platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks in Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyber Bancorp for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsored bank program.
* We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galileo instant verification engine, which we call GIVE as well as transaction risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new secured credit with dynamic funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit.
* We launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters, spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy, and scalable payment solutions.
* Delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter.
* In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients and strong improving returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and I am fired up for what in store.
* We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack.
* SoFi Money continues to resonate well, maintaining market share and ranking in API. We saw over $2 billion in member deposit growth in the quarter, with spending levels on par or better than historical levels. Direct deposit customers are more engaged, with higher product adoption, contributing to our competitive advantage.
* We declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential
* His closing statement: We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best patient company to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us because of the same thing that got us here, our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.

CFO:

* Loan Platform Deals: CFO: This is a fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We generate cash fees upfront at the time of transfer or referral without taking balance sheet risk. Importantly, there are no financing commitments or loss share agreements associated with these deals.
* There is a 220 basis points difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base.
* We expect modest growth in balance sheet originations year-over-year. We are happy with the current size of our balance sheet and the net interest income generated. Excess demand from borrowers and loan investors is being fulfilled through our loan platform business. We expect growth in student loan refinancing and home loans in a lower rate environment.
* Recent (loan) vintages are projected to produce higher returns, with ROEs above 30%. This is driven by lower expected life of loan loss rates, higher pricing beta, funding cost efficiencies, and origination fees.
* We expect continued strong growth in the loan platform business, with commitments from Fortress and other partners. Demand is strong, and we are fulfilling it through the loan platform business.
* For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels.
* Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and tech platform will grow low to upper teens percent year-over-year.
* GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.

stocks,1gg24n1,Dropbox - The outsider with a sticky product,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gg24n1/dropbox_the_outsider_with_a_sticky_product/,5,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.

It had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.

The freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).



**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**

A crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**

***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***

Cloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.

Moreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.

***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***

For many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.



**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**

It is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.

You’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.

However, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**

Don’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.

The competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***



**4.0 The past acquisitions**

The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:

* **July 2012, TapEngage** \- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*
* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*
* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \- *a company allowing users to ""aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*
* **July 2013, Endorse** \- *a mobile coupon startup.*
* **April 2014, Loom** \- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*
* **April 2014, Hackpad** \- *a document-sharing startup*
* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*
* **January 2015, CloudOn** \- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*
* **January 2019, HelloSign** \- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***
* **March 2021, DocSend** \- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*
* **October 2021, Command E** \- universal search company
* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*
* **December 2022, FormSwift** \- *form management platform*



There have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.



**5.0 The financials**

If you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

The revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.

The operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).

A lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.

From 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.

So, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \~20% since becoming a public company.

Based on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.

  
**6.0 The valuation**

How does one value a company of this kind?

It has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.

Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**

Inputs:

Free cash flow - SBC of $450m.

Growth in perpetuity of 4%.

Discount rate of 8%.

Adjusting for cash/debt

The value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.

  
**7.0 My thoughts**

A company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \~8% long-term yield seems fair.

I don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.

The only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.

stocks,1gfpzws,Who wins btwn NVO vs LLY in the Weightloss Market,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfpzws/who_wins_btwn_nvo_vs_lly_in_the_weightloss_market/,24,"Because of what I’ll talk about below I don’t include things like ALT or Viking therapeutics. In the long term their best plays feel like they lean more towards acquisition. 

It feels like we’re getting too bogged down on which drug performs marginally better when we look at weight loss drugs. It feels irrelevant to the fundamental assumptions baked into growth forecasts which is that there would be a wider adoption of the treatment. 

At the end of the day the semantics of x% weight loss on drug A vs y% on drug B only matter so much. I think what is really going to decide who wins this competition and who grows their market share is whoever is able to more materially lower their prices.

As income decreases obesity rates increase. As an example only 29% of women with incomes 350% above the poverty level are obese vs 42% of those that are 130% below the poverty level. There’s also a much broader market if you were to include a lower income groups. So having less access to more expensive and healthier foods means higher rates of obesity, this makes sense.

Frankly, I don’t think people in lower income groups care about which one is marginally better, they want something they can afford. And both NVO and LLY have such massive barriers to broadening their market because of their exorbitant pricing. There is a clear disconnect between variables that might increase the rate of someone having the ailment these companies want to treat, and the prices they sell these treatments for.

Wanted to wait until LLYs earnings came out today to see if this is an industry trend or not. And what I described above feels like it ties to what we’re seeing performance wise. Both LLY in its earnings today and NVO last quarter (and likely this quarter) had more substantial sales misses and changes to forward looking forecasts. 

To me this feel less like Competitor A selling more than Competitor B and moreso an industry wide forecast miss. And this forecast miss is because they assumed the market would grow more substantially by now, but I think they’re hitting a point where growth is slowing because the LARGER bucket of their addressable market really can’t afford their treatments at their current prices. 

So in the long run for a drug that treats ailments such as Ozempic or Zepbound it feels like this will be less of a race over which drug performs better and more towards which drug people can actually afford. As a result I think both NVO and LLY will decline in share price and performance until they figure this out. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? ",2024-10-30 15:59:36
stocks,1ggehhq,$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggehhq/uber_is_positioned_extremely_well_for_the_future/,16,"At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year. 

Disclaimer, I do have a position in UBER.",2024-10-31 13:26:37

stocks,1gf4btm,Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast,456,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf4btm/reddit_shares_soar_16_on_earnings_beat_and/,208,"Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

stocks,1gf523l,Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,355,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf523l/prediction_apple_is_grossly_priced_compared_to/,175,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",2024-10-29 20:47:24

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 25 cents expected

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.82 billion expected

Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $378.4 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $313.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The company’s food and beverage costs increased during the quarter, in part due to Chipotle’s decision to re-emphasize generous portions after social media-fueled backlash over the size of its burrito bowls this summer.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 13% to $2.79 billion. 

Same-store sales rose 6%, just shy of StreetAccount estimates of 6.3%. Traffic to restaurants increased 3.3% in the quarter, continuing the chain’s streak of bucking an overall slump in foot traffic across the industry. While many consumers have opted to eat out less, Chipotle has benefitted from having a wealthier customer base that’s willing to pay more for its burritos and bowls. 

During the third quarter, Chipotle brought back its popular smoked brisket for a limited time. It’s currently the most expensive protein, topping even the chain’s steak and beef barbacoa options.

Digital sales accounted for 34% of the chain’s quarterly food and beverage revenue.

The company opened 86 new locations during the quarter, 73 of which included a “Chipotlane” dedicated to online order pickup.

For the full year, Chipotle reiterated its outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. The company also anticipates that it will open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year.

Looking to 2025, Chipotle plans to open between 315 and 345 new locations. More than 80% of those restaurants will include a Chipotlane.

The earnings report marks the company’s first since CEO Brian Niccol departed to lead Starbucks’ turnaround. Chipotle’s board has tapped COO Scott Boatwright as the company’s interim chief executive.

CEO Alex may want to integrate the Big Bear constellation",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggar84/palantir_growth_is_written_in_the_stars_ceo_alex/,10,"Palantir has been one of the top-performing AI software stocks this year with a 156% YTD return, thanks to accelerating revenue growth and strong business momentum from its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) released last year.

AIP sets Palantir apart from the rest of the SaaS universe, driving visible AI-related growth and acceleration in multiple different metrics – at this time, other leading AI favorites such as Snowflake or MongoDB can’t say the same. Outside of the cloud hyperscalers, Palantir is one of the rare few that sees AI drive both real returns for its business and real value for its customers due to AIP.

AIP has driven tremendous growth for Palantir’s business since its release, with primary impacts arising in the commercial segment. A clear inflection point in Palantir’s growth is visible following AIP’s release, while other ‘AI’ cloud peers can’t say the same about AI-driven growth.

1. 83% YoY growth in US commercial customers to 295 and 98% YoY growth in US commercial deals closed to 123.
2. 103% YoY growth in US commercial remaining deal value and 152% YoY growth in US commercial total contract value

* Recently Palantir CEO gave an interview on Real Time by Bill Maher, clearly Karb is obsessed with defense
   * Please look up (link not allowed)
      * This interview made me think about Big Bear Ai recent contract and the existing partnership between the two companies. Big Bear breaking into the defense sphere recently puts them on the map, and more such contracts are expected, No to mention the numerous airports and boat terminals that adopt BBAI technology.

====================================

* BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI) has been awarded a **five-year, $165.15 million sole source prime contract** by the U.S. Army for Global Force Information Management (GFIM) Production Services. This contract builds on BigBear.ai's ongoing work since 2021 to transform 15 legacy systems into an enterprise-wide intelligent automation platform, supporting the Army's vision for data-centric force management. The primary objective is to deliver a **dynamic, integrated, and interoperable transactional global force structure and employment data system** for the force management community. Upon completion, GFIM-OE will enable senior leaders and combatant commanders to make data-driven force structure decisions more quickly and with greater confidence, ensuring the Army is properly manned, equipped, trained, and resourced.
   * Five-year contract duration provides stable revenue stream
   * Sole source prime contractor status for the project
   * Continuation and expansion of existing partnership with the Army
   * Opportunity to contribute to critical military force management systems

stocks,1gf1bg5,"Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google",84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf1bg5/microsofts_github_goes_beyond_openai_welcomes_ai/,5,"Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

So pfizer reported their earnings yesterday and excluding covid products, their revenues grew in lower double digits. They haven't quantitatively addressed their upcoming patent cliffs and how they expect to offset those with new products.

Googling revealed that pharmas generally lose about 40-90% of their product revenues in the 1st year itself post patent expiration. I did some rough calculation and considering about 3 billion coming in from oncology products, growing at about 35% yoy, they will only cover about much less than 50% of the revenue losses due to patent expiration from 2026 onwards.

I'm not sure how accurate my numbers are but I reduced the revenue contribution of expiring patents by 40% yoy for 2026, 27, 28 and oncology contributions simply can't catch up. I know they have other products in pipeline, including oral GLP but I'm not sure how to account for that.

Can someone point me to more reading material on analysis or their analysis?

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

stocks,1gfqlq2,Why SMCI's situation is a massive threat to Nvidia,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfqlq2/why_smcis_situation_is_a_massive_threat_to_nvidia/,89,"SMCI has faced allegations of accounting manipulation, which have escalated this morning when it was revealed that their auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The true extent of the situation is not yet known to the public

SMCI is one of Nvidia's largest customers, accounting for 9% of their sales. If they go under, Nvidia will take a massive hit to their future earnings.

Some may argue that it does not matter, because since Nvidia's production is sold out, any gap in orders would be filled by other customers. There are 2 problems with this assumption:

1. This ignores the impact of a hypothetical liquidation of SMCI. If SMCI was faking orders, this would mean that they likely have a growing inventory of AI chips. These would then be auctioned off, creating a surge in supply, competing with new orders.

2. The duration of Nvidia's lead times can impact their margins and pricing power. If you have a 12 month lead time due to immense demand, you can hike prices. If that lead time shrinks to 1 month due to losing a significant customer, you have less margin to raise prices without impacting sales.

This scandal could also draw attention to other ""round tripping"" arrangements in the tech industry, in which circular transactions are set up in order to fake revenue growth. This could very much be the start of the unraveling of a bubble.

This isn't going to bankrupt Nvidia, they still have incredibly successful products and other customers, but it could definitely lead to a case where earnings growth stagnates, or is not sufficient enough to justify their current share price.

Despite this tremendous threat, Nvidia is down just 1% today, which is well within its normal volatility. The market is not responding to this new information appropriately.",2024-10-30 16:24:39
stocks,1geu345,McDonald's reverses U.S. same-store sales declines in Q3; E. coli fallout looms,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1geu345/mcdonalds_reverses_us_samestore_sales_declines_in/,35,"McDonald’s on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as its U.S. restaurants reversed last quarter’s same-store sales decline.

However, investors are worried about another dent to U.S. sales fueled by a recent E. coli outbreak across 13 states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers. As of Friday, 75 health cases have been tied to the outbreak, including one death of an older adult.

Health authorities have honed in on the burger’s slivered onions as the likely source, and McDonald’s has suspended its relationship with the supplier. Quarter Pounder burgers will return to affected restaurants on a rolling basis this week, sans slivered onions.

“While the situation appears to be contained, and though it didn’t affect Q3 numbers, it’s certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors on the company’s earnings call, adding that McDonald’s was sorry and is committed to “making this right.”

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.23 adjusted vs. $3.20 expected

Revenue: $6.87 billion vs. $6.82 billion expected

McDonald’s posted third-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, the fast-food giant earned $3.23 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $6.87 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales fell 1.5%, a more drastic decline than the 0.6% that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates, and was weighed down by the company’s international markets. It’s the second straight quarter that the company’s same-store sales have fallen.

“While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance this year has fallen short of our expectations,” Kempczinski said.

U.S. same-store sales rose 0.3%, reversing last quarter’s same-store sales declines but still slightly weaker than the 0.5% increase predicted by StreetAccount estimates. Traffic to its U.S. restaurants was slightly negative, but the company credited its marketing and a $5 value meal launched in late June for the increase in sales.

Diners have pulled back their restaurant spending, leading McDonald’s and its rivals to lean into discounts and other marketing tricks to bring customers back to their restaurants. For example, in August, McDonald’s launched limited-time “Collector’s Edition” cups.

The company’s two international divisions both reported steeper declines in same-store sales compared with the prior quarter. The international operated markets segment, which includes France, Germany and Australia, saw same-store sales shrink 2.1%. The international developmental licensed markets division reported same-store sales declines of 3.5%, driven by weak demand in the Middle East and China.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, it’s unclear how the E. coli outbreak might affect U.S. sales, particularly as consumers have grown more picky about how to spend their money and where.

McDonald’s executives have taken steps to reassure customers that the company’s menu items are safe to eat, including pulling Quarter Pounder burgers from menus in the affected areas until its beef patties were cleared as the culprit.

Still, foot traffic to U.S. locations fell roughly 10% in the three days immediately following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement last Tuesday of the E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s, according to a research note from Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

stocks,1ge82cr,JPMorgan is suing customers accused of theft in viral 'infinite money glitch',597,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge82cr/jpmorgan_is_suing_customers_accused_of_theft_in/,240,"JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.

The bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.

A Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.

“On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant’s Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,” the bank said in the Texas filing. “After the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.”

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the “infinite money glitch,” though it hasn’t disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they’re still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq’s Global Financial Crime Report.

The infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.

Normally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.

Miami and California

The other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.

Most cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.

In each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn’t been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.

JPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers’ fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.

Criminal cases?

The lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won’t tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.

The civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.

“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”

In other instances we hear assets are dropping because the liquidity cycle just peaked. 

What is this liquidity we are talking about here and where does it all come from? Clearly there are many sources, but who are the main ones and how do they operate? 

The easiest one to point to is the Federal Reserve and its many QE (quantitative easing) programs. However, liquidity often rises even when the FED is running QT (quantitative tightening) as was the case in 2023.

Many point to the treasury as the hidden source of liquidity conducting a stealth QE of sort, but how do they do that? How do they manage to inject money into the stock market? 

Its clear they can do that directly to the economy by handing out stimulus checks and paying for new government projects, but that does not directly go to the market.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,1ge47le,"I got offered a job at a startup company as a contractor, but will only get paid in ""preferred"" stock. How does that work ?",265,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge47le/i_got_offered_a_job_at_a_startup_company_as_a/,153,"As the title said, I got offered a job as a contractor at a startup company (a private one). They demand 20hrs/week minimum, at 40$/hr. At the end end of the month, I'll get compensation in stock only based on the hours I worked. The contract also says the stock is at 1$ ""preferred"". How does it work ? I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.

I have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  
What if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?

What if there's no one to sell to ?

What if the company goes bankrupt ?

Should I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?

Does it take long to convert ?

Is it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?

Also, any taxes I should worry about ?

EDIT ===========

Thank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)

I have a deep itm QQQ 2026. I want to sell to open a call a month out. What if QQQ goes past strike price and I get assigned? I don’t have enough cash to buy and sell. Since it’s IRA account, I can only have limited margin account which doesn’t let me borrow. Also does fidelity automatically exercise for buyer it ITM? Can someone also explain how that makes sense, why would they wanna exercise below breakeven? I’m assuming it’s so it doesn’t expire worthless?

I understand I can buy back to close the option. I don’t own the actual shares",2024-10-29 16:52:33

The Volkswagen management recently presented plans to the council that include a 10% reduction in pay across the board, as well as wage freezes in 2025 and 2026, according to Daniela Cavallo, head of the works council. All factored in, the body estimates workers will suffer pay cuts of around 18% over the period.

Volkswagen also intends to shut three factories and downsize all other plants in Germany, Cavallo said, adding that sweeping job cuts were part of carmaker’s plan.

Also, if I really believe in this stock and that the calls will pay, should I be buying the ""dip""?

I got a lot of apples and oranges responses.
I understand they are in different industries but a dollar is a dollar and I rather spend it on a stock with better value. Google is a way better company in every metric (even before today's earnings). 

I also got a lot of responses like ChatGpt will destroy search and Lina Khan will smash it into a million pieces.

Anyone still rather buy Nike over Google? 🍿",2024-10-30 06:55:52
stocks,1gebv9q,Ford guides to low end of 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly tops Wall Street's Q3 expectations,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gebv9q/ford_guides_to_low_end_of_2024_earnings_forecast/,26,"Ford Motor guided to the low end of its previously announced 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly topped Wall Street’s third-quarter expectations.

The Detroit automaker said Monday it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of about $10 billion. It had previously guided to between $10 billion and $12 billion. It retained its forecast for adjusted free cash flow of between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion.

Here’s how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 49 cents adj. vs. 47 cents adj. expected

Automotive revenue: $43.07 billion vs. $41.88 billion expected

The automaker was under pressure after a disappointing second quarter in which unexpected warranty costs caused the company to miss Wall Street’s earnings expectations.
