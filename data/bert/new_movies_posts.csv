Each character is complex and layered, some are despicable, some are reasonable, and their interactions among one another are unforgettable. An absolute must watch, it would take pages and pages to fully discuss how incredible this movie is but I urge anyone seeing this to not be afraid of its age; it’s utterly timeless and could pass for a movie released in the 90s.",2024-11-13 02:56:24

My daughter and I laughed hard watching Let’s Be Cops with Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr (uncanny how much he looks like his dad), and I was surprised that the RT critic and audience scores (19% and 51%) were as low as they were. I certainly wouldn’t call it a “great” comedy, but we really had fun with it and have watched it at least a couple of times.

Edit: Stuart Saves His Family (30% & 53%) is a movie I’ve watched multiple times. I always liked the Stuart Smalley character on SNL. It is really funny and surprisingly moving, and Vincent D’Onofrio is great as usual.",2024-11-12 10:47:33

Anyone else a fan of these movies? 70s 80s Teen comedies, a lot are LA based or beach settings. I've seen a ton of them but always looking for more. Some of my favorites:

* Beach Girls
* Last American Virgin (heartbreaking comedy. Based on a huge Israeli hit from same director)
* Gas Pump Girls (has a crazy musical number in it out of nowhere)
* Malibu Beach
* Up the Creek
* Hot Dog the movie
* Spring Break (director of Friday the 13th)
* Where the Boys Are 84
* Joysticks
* Hardbodies
* Fast Times at Ridgemont High
* Valley Girl (with Nic Cage... classic)

Stuff like these. There's a few studio movies of this type like Fast Times and Valley Girl and famously Porky's... and there's a lot more b movie indie films like Joysticks and Screwballs. I watched Joysticks last night. Not great but I enjoy the dumbness of it all.

movies,1gq4scp,Arrival - Discussion of the Source Material (Stories of Your Life and Others) ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gq4scp/arrival_discussion_of_the_source_material_stories/,1,"I absolutely loved Stories of Your Life and Others! This short story collection was something new for me. I usually gravitate toward longer works, so I wasn’t sure what to expect from these shorter pieces (the only other short story collections I’d read were the first two Witcher books). But wow—these stories were perfect. They never felt rushed, nor did they overstay their welcome. Each one felt like its own immersive journey, with just the right balance.

The collection is rooted in science fiction and speculative fiction, my favourite genres, especially when there’s a philosophical twist woven into the plot. Chiang’s writing explores big ideas without feeling heavy or overly abstract—it’s like he makes you ponder the universe while staying grounded in the human experience. I think that’s what made this such a standout read for me.

It’s hard to choose a favourite, but “Tower of Babylon” and “Liking What You See: A Documentary” are definitely at the top. “Liking What You See” especially blew me away; it’s structured like a series of interviews, capturing students’ opinions on a topic that’s both futuristic and unsettlingly relevant. It almost reads like a real documentary, with a journalistic feel that makes it so vivid and believable. This unique style pulled me right in and kept me thinking about it long after I’d finished.

And, of course, I have to mention “Story of Your Life.” I’d seen Arrival a few times (Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite directors!), and I was thrilled to read the story it was based on. Villeneuve’s adaptation is phenomenal—he captures the core of the story while adding his own cinematic magic, especially with the tension and atmosphere he brings in with the military storyline. The film nails both the personal and the universal themes in Chiang’s work and if you’re a fan of Arrival, you need to read this collection. The story is just as poignant, and so are the others in their own way.

After being blown away by Ted Chiang, I’m all in for more short story collections. I’m thinking of trying Neil Gaiman’s Smoke and Mirrors or Fragile Things since I love his writing style. If anyone has other recommendations for short stories, I’d really appreciate them—drop them in the comments! I’m eager to dive deeper into this format now.

Each story in Stories of Your Life and Others is breathtakingly unique, tackling themes that range widely but always hit home. They’re impactful, making you think about the human condition, the possibilities of science, and new ways of looking at the world. It’s a quick read that’s also deeply satisfying, leaving you with a lot to ponder.

I can’t recommend this collection enough. I loved it! If you’ve read it, let me know which story stood out to you the most—I’d love to hear your thoughts!

since more than two weeks, I ask you for the most favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Greece's turn and in keeping with the fact that there seems to have been a little or a lot of hype surrounding the director of *Poor Things* since the release of this same film, another film from his portfolio has won: ***Κυνόδοντας*** (engl.: *Dogtooth*).

I had thought of a certain Alexis beforehand, but it seems that newer films are winning more often than I might have bet on. I can't wait to see whether the next country will be the same: It's about movies set in **Hungary**. As usual, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

>*Gladiator* is a hard act to follow but Sir Ridley Scott proves still to be a master working up a Roman orgy of excitement that proves a worthy successor in every way.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-ridley-scott-1236057985/) (60):

>In terms of brutal spectacle, elaborate period reconstruction and vigorous set pieces requiring complex choreography, the sequel delivers what fans of its Oscar-winning 2000 predecessor will crave — battles, swordplay, bloodshed, Ancient Roman intrigue. That said, there’s a déjà vu quality to much of the new film, a slavishness that goes beyond the caged men forced to fight for their survival, and seeps into the very bones of a drama overly beholden to the original.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-pedro-pascal-ridley-scott-1236204115/) (70):

>Written by David Scarpa (“Napoleon”) and directed by Scott (who, at 86, hasn’t lost his touch for the peacock pageantry of teeming masses thirsting for blood), the movie is a solid piece of neoclassical popcorn — a serviceable epic of brutal warfare, Colosseum duels featuring lavish decapitations and beasts both animal and human, along with the middlebrow “decadence” of palace intrigue.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal/) (58):

>“Gladiator II” has everything it needs in the action department. The battles are certainly spectacular. It’s the story that falls apart. The whole thing hangs on contrivance and familiarity, not characters, so the fights don’t seem to matter much. Even Denzel Washington, who has all the best scenes and looks like he’s enjoying himself more than he has on screen in years, can’t save this material because the material isn’t focused on him. Macrinus is a lot more interesting than our hero. Come to think of it, so is General Acacius. They could have carried the whole movie themselves, one or the other or both. Which means the thing that’s holding “Gladiator II” back is, weirdly, the fact that it’s about a gladiator.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/gladiator-2-review/) (80):

>Not perfect and not a patch on the original film, but the magic of Ridley Scott's direction and Denzel Washington's performance elevates Gladiator 2 into the epic spectacle it needs to be. But best to manage your expectations in comparison to the Oscar-winning film.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-ridley-scott) (4/5):

>Scott’s return to the Roman arena is something of a repeat, but it’s still a thrilling spectacle and Mescal a formidable lead. We are entertained.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-1235064268/) (50):

>Gladiator II” wouldn’t be the first sequel to become bogged down in its resemblance to its forebear, but the various superficial modifications made to characterizations and action sequences operate under faulty bigger-is-better sequel logic.

Directed by Ridley Scott:

>Over two decades after the events of Gladiator, Lucius—the son of Lucilla and Maximus—lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by General Marcus Acacius invade, killing his wife and forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator under the teaching of Macrinus, a former slave who plots to overthrow the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.

Cast:

* Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus
* Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius
* Joseph Quinn as Emperor Geta
* Fred Hechinger as Emperor Caracalla
* Lior Raz as Vigo
* Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus
* Connie Nielsen as Lucilla

It has me thinking about how the entity works and how it affects it users. Lets look at Rose, she was a doctor, who witnessed one of her patients cut her face up, pretty scary sure but enough to traumatize anyone. She eventually saw hallucinations then ultimately died. Joel was a cop so he could deal with trauma better than the average person, he managed to last 6 days before dying by a truck so he technically beat the entity.

  
But Skye had a plethora of trauma watching her BF die (edit: and killing him), drug abuse, and all the trauma that comes from being in the music industry, and ofc watching her drug dealer Lewis bash his face in. It makes me wonder was Skye's hallucinations in a sense ""sped"" up because of how much she had prior to getting infected? Rose lasted the entire movie before having a fake out scene of escaping but for skye she never even met Gemma and that's fairly early in the film. Did she meet Morris? If so, she clearly didn't meet him after the first encounter since the entire scene of the people in her apartment scene up until her actual death was a fake out...

  
So I guess I'm asking is it the amount of trauma you have that speed up this creatures reveal to the user? Or is it how they've handled that trauma all their life? Joel's a cop he definitely has seen some stuff but over time learned to handle it well so much so he can look past a burning Rose. Rose was a doctor probably had seen death but saw a sadistic suicide, Skye though was a huge mess when everything went wrong for her with immense pressure from everyone around her to perform at a level she wasn't ready for hence the hair pulling scenes. This all leading to the critique of what's real half the time, I think this is more of an artistic choice rather than an overlook to just be scary.",2024-11-13 04:54:18

So that in a movie not everything has to be part of the main story but they give a lot of time and importance to her calls to Sean and also to the mystery and I don't understand why. So I know why she was doing it, to ""test Sean"", wait for his first move and reunite but it seems like it's not part of the story, it seems like a subplot for a whole other story about Sean. The three main characters are equally important, I don't question that but Sean sometimes seems more like an outsider in the, like only a way to represent the reason and justice that Jimmy and Dave lack. I tried to think about it and maybe the wife was just a metaphor to show how Sean feels too much and like he detached himself from his wife therefore he detached from his friends, old life after the dave incident? Everything from dave and jimmy lifes were linked in some ways and also the main plot events but Sean expect for being the Detective and being spectator of dave's kidnap had ""nothing"" to do with them.

5. Terminator

6. The Abyss

7. True Lies

8. Avatar 2

9. Piranha 2

  
We can agree to disagree. It's just my personal preference. Terminator 2 for me just hits this chord within myself. without that personal connection. I would have put Titanic first. 

I actually probably have seen True Lies more than the rest of the list since we had it on VHS, but revisiting it made me realise that it's probably one of his most uneven films. Great set pieces and humour though.

I have immense respect for the people that put in the work for this movie (I also really like Paul Mescal) BUT what in the fresh hell was that? Why did every major moment feel so anti-climatic? The editing was SO choppy - you’re barely given any time to feel anything - and every emotional moment in the movie felt forced and engineered. Literally felt like the audience was being told to care about certain moments (which, again, I know that directors/screenwriters do, but maybe a little subtly and with more nuance?). I also feel like all the references to the original did not feel genuine and were in there just to derive some of the emotional impact of that. Also the lines? The most over the top had to be “wood or metal, a point is still a point” or something like that SMH. Am I also missing a major plot line because why the hell did certain characters in the movie keep say that Lucius’ dad was Maximus?

I thought it would be a cheap dtv movie but watched it in theaters due to the reviews. There was a lot I liked about it. First of all, the humanity of the story.

Gerard Butler is a pilot, not a professional fighter. He never becomes the gun professional you would expect him to turn into from some of his other movies, he stays a relatively normal person.

Also, the movie is not about protecting the world population from a danger beyond our current imagination. It is entirely about saving those stranded passengers from the enemies on the island. This makes it very grounded.

Although there is not a lot of action, I like what is included. The long take fight in the middle of the movie and the sniper scene near the end are enough to fully satisfy my action needs and stay true to the more realistic tone when compared to big blockbuster movies.

Perks of being a wallflower just come across as boring, fake deep and hella cringey and touched on some very hard topics but the didn't seem genuine to me.

Some movies played repeatedly. For instance, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle would show over and over on a local TV network. Even though I didn’t grasp all the details, certain moments and character behaviors helped me figure out who was the bad guy and who was the victim. Understood the broad strokes.

Two scenes, in particular, were especially intense. There’s the one where Julianne Moore’s character walks into the greenhouse, and the glass falls on her. They cut to Rebecca De Mornay’s character just staring at her with this cold, psychotic expression. And then that last scene, where the woman is scrambling for her inhaler—I remember how scary that felt, watching the adults in the room freak out as she struggled to breathe.

Not sure why it took me forever to see it, but how I ended up watching it actually feels symbolic. It was the day before my birthday, and I was dealing with a lot of family stuff. This guy I was seeing at the time came over to comfort me. He suggested we watch a movie, and La La Land came up on Netflix. When he found out I’d never seen it, he insisted we put it on.

I loved it, but I was so distracted by everything going on that I couldn’t fully immerse myself. Flash forward to now—months later, I was out at a bar, and they were advertising a rooftop movie night featuring La La Land. It immediately made me want to rewatch it. Living in LA, this movie already hits a little harder, and adding to that, the guy I watched it with in June is no longer in my life.

We ended our story a few weeks ago. In July, he went on a three-month solo trip that I knew about when we first started seeing each other. He messaged me a few times while he was gone, and I couldn’t help but hope we’d pick things up when he got back. I wasn’t waiting around for him, but I did reach out once he returned since I wasn’t exclusively seeing anyone. He messaged back, saying he’d love to see me, but he’s planning to leave LA and is applying to grad schools. It crushed me.

Watching the movie again now, with him out of my life because he’s following his own path, I just broke down. It hit so hard to think about what could’ve been because things between us felt so good. Part of me thinks maybe one day we’ll cross paths again, and maybe we’ll both be single and find each other at the right time. But the other part of me wonders if our paths are just meant to lead us to different people.

“I think [studios] forget that releasing films in theaters first, it’s not an elitist thing. Everybody will eventually see the film, but what it is — putting it out there and exhibiting it the way that is the most ideal way of presenting it to audiences — it elevates the importance,” Baker said. “Number one, people have to actually schedule their night, spend money, travel to a theater. I think it ups the importance of it in our minds.”

I've seen several redditors try and counter this point, and I've never seen one whose point really goes any further than ""because I don't wanna wait"" no matter how much they dress it up.  I get that you might have limitations that prevent you from enjoying or even being able to go to the theater and that it can be frustrating that you can't see something you want to see, but sorry guys that obv shouldn't come at the cost of the experience being crafted by artists.  It's not a punishment to wait a few months ffs.

Look I like streaming, I grew up with it and it's convenience.  But when I was a teen I started going to the theater more and appreciating it for giving me an experience I can't match at home.  Hell can anyone match it?  Do you have anywhere between 8 and 64 cinema speakers in your home?  And that's not even touching on the whole cultural relevancy topic.  Can you imagine if longlegs went straight to streaming?  I didn't even like the movie that much and I still talk about it. (Not a movie but it's funny to me no one mentions stranger things for like 2 years, then it's all the talk for 2 weeks max, then another 2 years of nothing)

Hopefully theaters can continue to draw people back post covid and work on making the experience and quality better for people.  I also read AMC was planning some major renovations so it sounds like we're getting a first step.",2024-11-11 14:14:35

We also watched Seven, after all these years. Of course we knew what was in the box because pop-culture, but that doesn't make the whole movie any less effective.

It is about twelve Japanese sailors who are stranded on a deserted and forgotten island called Anatahan in June 1944 and spend seven years there. The only inhabitants of the island are the overseer of a former plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. Discipline is embodied by a former petty officer, but it collapses when he suffers a disastrous loss of prestige. Soon, discipline and reason are replaced by a struggle for power and women. Power is represented by two pistols found in an American plane that crashed on the island and is so brutal that five men pay with their lives in the struggle for control.

Anatahan, an island in the Mariana Islands archipelago in the tropical Pacific, was the scene of the event. Thirty Japanese sailors and soldiers and one Japanese woman were stranded here during the war. The castaways hid until they surrendered to a U.S. Navy rescue team in 1951, almost seven years after Japan’s defeat. The twenty people who survived this hell were warmly welcomed upon their return to post-war Japan. International interest, including an article in Life magazine on July 16, 1951, inspired Josef von Sternberg to adapt the story into a feature-length documentary film, the plot of which was set within the framework of the events that had become known.

By the end of 1951, shocking personal details had come to light about the deaths and disappearances of men in the rivalry over the only woman on the island, Higa Kazuko.

Although the film features Japanese dialogue throughout, this is not translated into English - instead, we have the writer-director himself providing intermittent commentary to expound on the action! Even so, this and the ghostly parade of victims at the end constitute the only stylistic flourishes within the film.

His Marlene Dietrich films center around a mysterious woman upon whom men project their desires for sex, love, violence and revenge. Here Keiko is the final mystic Sternberg temptress. Like Concha in The devil is a woman, she watches, calmly bemused, as the men fight, kill, and die to possess her. Like all the classic Sternberg heroines, she is a free agent and a free spirit, using her sensuality to get her way at times, but never belonging to any one man any longer than she chooses.

The topic is to find a rather popular movie and analyze it through the lens of two classic social theories or subtheories of them. So, for example Marx's theory of alienation, or Comte's three stages of society, or Weber's definition of power and the types of authority, etc. (note that it's a classical social theory class, so from Montesquieu only up to Weber, no modern theorists).

It doesn't have to be the whole movie's theme. It can focus on a single character, a part of the film, even a scene, as long as it is powerful and meaningful enough for a 3.5-5k essay. 🥲

Soo, do you have any suggestions please? And if so, how you think it connects to a social theory very briefly?

Dreams are illogical, sometimes you're not yourself in your dreams, sometimes people around you change shape or into different people altogether while they still 'feel' like the same person or character they were playing 

Matter and its natural laws aren't consistent in dreams, and this goes beyond just anti gravity or turning buildings into walking paths this goes to things like trying to pick up a glass and your hand goes through it

Dreams have a lot of 'haze' to them, often people experience confusion of what is actually happening in a dream

Dreams also shift location or storyline altogether at rapid and inconsistent paces 

Inception is an action movie with some loose rules on scientific laws that allow for anti gravity hall fights and car chases but they none of those scenes actually feel like what a dream is like

For that reason I think Inception is overly hyped and ultimately quite a disappointment that hollywood gave Nolan a blank cheque to make a movie about dreams and it turned into a very soulless expression of that theme",2024-11-12 22:25:09

Reading the reviews, it is impossible not to notice that the film is compared to Gladiator at every turn, thus allowing it to fall short in the comparison.

I wonder how many ""second parts"" or ""third parts"" in the history of cinema have failed because they fell victim to this comparison?  What do you think?

movies,1gov0u8,Favorite movie by european country: Greece,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gov0u8/favorite_movie_by_european_country_greece/,53,"Hello there,

since more than two weeks I'm asking you for participating on my search for the most favorite movie set in a given european country everyday. There are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today. Especially, when it's hard to find a movie that entirely takes place in the given country, it's okay, when only a certain part of the story is set there - but all in all, it has to be the biggest part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

Two days ago, especially the first rule lead to some confusion. I'm very happy that I'm able to declare ***ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი*** (engl.: *Blue Mountains*) the winner for Georgia today, but when it comes to upvotes (minus downvotes), he was really only the runner-up while the movie with the most of them was only set in Georgia for about 10 minutes, before the main protagonist took a journey to Germany. Funnily enough, Germany was the next country in my list and the yesterday, ***Das Leben der Anderen*** (engl.: *The Lives of Others*) won by a wide margin.

Because Germany is my home country, I could write much longer about it now - like how I thought a certain running Lola would win, or how disappointed I am that no one put *Werner - Beinhart* in the running - but really, it's time to move on now... to **Greece**. This time I've put the two rules right at the beginning of the post, so I'll just wish you lots of fun at this point.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,1gp5bfu,I watched Jean-Luc Godard's Masculin Féminin on Facebook,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gp5bfu/i_watched_jeanluc_godards_masculin_féminin_on/,1,"It is a tender and intimate look at the lives of young people in the 60s in Paris. The film follows two characters, male and female as they navigate love and the changing, ever turbulent landscape of life. The film explores the two of them through 15 interconnected but separate parts and every part has a monologue or introductory text on screen. These don't often talk about the film but also outside of it as well, most of them are for us the audience even when they relate to the plot.

The film is a drama about youth and their struggles to live and react and adjust in a world that is uncertain and cruel and things that are happening in such a wide scale that we have no control over them. It feels like a glimpse into that era, as if we're seeing how people must have lived, thought, loved and died in that time. This is pronounced more through the use of shots of people wandering in the streets going to and fro in between the 15 parts.The themes that are talked about here resemble the ones found in Alphaville even though genre-wise these both movies are very different. Love and it's need in human life, violence and power and using that to decide things in other people's lives, the word ""tenderness"" and it's importance in the narrative,  poetry and the attitude different characters have to it.

This was so refreshing and different and bolder than most modern movies being made today, it isn't afraid to talk about things it wants to yet there is a tenderness to it though it's less romantic than Alphaville",2024-11-11 22:34:09

Normally, I love a movie that tries to go portray a morally messed up character in a way that still makes you feel empathy. I love Scorsese movies for this reason.

However, where Scorsese does not shy away from showing the moral shortcomings of his main characters, I feel Spielberg did not really seem to portray Franks behavior as wrong at all. The music makes it all feel like it is a family friendly ""Home Alone"" ordeal. As if Frank is just being a little rascall that is ultimately a good person. He really isn't though. Pretending to be a co-pilot is one thing, but pretending to be a doctor, or Marrying a girl who'se life must be entirely ruined after finding out how her husbands life is a complete lie. I feel like the movie is still portraying Frank as if he is just misunderstood, and broken about his parents divorce. 

I really don't get the hype this movie gets (though Leo's acting is great). I am aware that the real Frank made up vast amounts about the story, but even when you don't take that in account, it is still portrayed a little weird.

It captures big ideas, all manner of special effects, an intelligent and engaging script, an energising score and presents it as a summer movie treat. 

The sequels didn’t quite capture the same magic, but hey kids - dinosaurs! Always entertaining!

Jurassic World follows through on the premise of what if the park actually opened? And it’s an engaging movie. As a sequel, it works well alongside the original. 

And then we have the Jurassic World sequels - Fallen Kingdom and Dominion. 

The kindest thing I can say about them is that they look good. Honestly though, having recently rewatched them, I am legitimately surprised at how fantastically boring they are. 

How do you make dinosaurs boring? Well, you treat them as if they are of no consequence. And that’s what both of the sequels do. Sure, the scripts for each voice how concerned they are for the dinosaurs welfare etc, but these are giant man-eating monsters. 

And these movies make them boring.

Kit Culkin is maybe the most infamous example of recent decades (give credit to his sons for being able to escape and keep working, especially Kiernan with ""Succession), but one I especially feel bad for is Will Wheaton. Want to know how he did so well as the neglected Gordie in ""Stand by Me?"" Because he drew from experience as his actual parents were WORSE. Big example; he did the cheesy horror flick ""The Curse"" the next year because his parents wanted the bigger payday and because his sister could be cast as well. And not only did the film fail and do considerable damage to his career, but he and his sister frequently had to work 12 hour days in violation of child labor laws and in frequently hazardous conditions and that big payday was largely spent by the parents on themselves. Is it any wonder Wheaton's considered his ""Star Trek"" cast mates more family than his actual parents? 

One more amusing example, however, is from the 1988 ""The Blob"", where young Douglas Emerson (later the ill-fated Scott on ""90210"") had an overbearing stage mom who kept pestering director Chuck Russell to give him more screentime. This may be a factor as to why Emerson's character gets such an ugly demise near the climax.",2024-11-10 15:55:25

movies,1gnzxtl,Last night I watched Dragged Across Concrete,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnzxtl/last_night_i_watched_dragged_across_concrete/,180,"After watching all three of his films, I can now safely say that Zahler is one of my absolute favorite filmmakers working today. His movies have such a visceral, intense quality that’s impossible to shake off. They’re ultra slow-paced, but in the best way possible, adding to the tension and making them incredibly nerve-racking. When the violence finally arrives, it really hits you, and no one writes dialogue quite like he does.

The last hour of Concrete is one of the most thrilling things I’ve seen in film in quite some time. Once Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn start following the van, the movie turns into a nonstop action thriller scene that stretches out the suspense as long as possible.

I also want to add that, while I agree it’s clear Zahler isn’t particularly left-leaning, I strongly disagree with the idea that he’s an “ultra right-winger” making films for white supremacists. Not for a moment do I feel that his movies endorse the actions of his characters or reflect Zahler’s personal beliefs. The ideals of the characters and those of the writer can be entirely separate.

To be clear, I’m not suggesting Zahler is a Marxist, but I’ve heard him say more than once that his art isn’t politically driven, and I believe that. I always feel he’s honestly exploring the harsh worlds he portrays, not justifying anything.

Anyway, I would love to discuss the movie and the rest of his work with others that are also interested in him.",2024-11-10 12:48:42

I told my Mom and Sister that they needed to watch it because it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.

My sister was basically getting all the information somewhat correct for never having seen it before, so I was super excited for the ending.

And then... There we were, the last few minutes... She sees a spinning top and sits with a complete blank expression. My sister was sitting there awestruck going ""Oh no, oh no don't tell me he's still in a dream!"" 


And my Mom, still sitting there expressionless, but now clueless as to why my Sister was acting the way she was, then she proceeds to Says ""Oh, I thought if it kept spinning it was reality 👁️👄👁️""

They make a small role in in a small film. Critically well received, not big in box office. Then they do small roles in big films. Well received. Then they get a main role in a cheap film that ended up doing really good. Then thy do the big budget action films that end up failing. That is the usually life cycle. If they are lucky, they can bounce back after a few small good films

I have seen this trend and can recognise it. I remember it with Vin Diesel who went from an indie film to Saving Private Ryan to pitch Black then Fast and Furious and his big flop was XXX. That same year 2002, Colin Farrell started in Minority Report and Harts War that made him big. He broke through in TigerLand.He became huge the next year with The Recruit Daredevil and phone Booth.

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but in my eyes, it has to be the largest part. 
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

I loves both the characters of Nate and Andy and I could completely understand the drift apart as Andy grows and changes into this dark human and pushes away her friends and her boyfriend.

I felt that Nate wasn't given fair closure at the end of the movie and honestly in my opinion I'd be much happy seeing him move on with someone else as a consequence of her own actions and decisions Andy made throughout the film.

I was disgusted to then look Into the movie more and to find people are siding with Andy in this narrative saying Nate is a bad boyfriend??
What??

Unfortunately it's unclear how long Andy and Nate were together before the changes however it's reasonable to think it was a good amount of time considering they live together and they share a social circle. So for me Nate had spent years loving this person who in a very short period of time changed in such a dark way and without real justification that he couldn't support the change. In fact he and all of the friends did what they could to try and make Andy realise just how far she had swung from herself for a job she herself didn't value. 

And not to brush over the fact that only days after loosing her love she jumped in bed with a man she hardly knew? Someone shed had less and 24 hours contact with between calls texts and their date over the course of however months when they met... 
I am sorry but this trait isn't something you just get or change into it's part of who someone is.

Nate acted out yes but it's understandable considering everything he was going through... 

So my takeaway. 
Nate deserves better than Andy and should have moved on alone after their meeting in the restaurant to tell her about the new job.",2024-11-12 01:01:03

* Really, I watched this movie because of Ron Cobb's involvement, but was surprised to find out that special effects supremo Stan Winston was involved in creating the various creatures as well. This movie had more special effects talent than it knew what to do with.
* The poster and promotional material make it sound a lot like The Abyss (1988). The actual plot is much more like Alien (1979), with a little of The Thing (1984) sprinkled in.
* Ernie Hudson is immensely likeable as a workaday grunt. He really bulked up for this role, and I'm surprised that he never broke into the action movie A-list like Wesley Snipes or Danny Glover.
* Amanda Pays steals the show as a competent and capable cadette on her way to astronaut school. It's astonishing that her career never came to anything after this. This girl could act.
* It's odd to watch a movie as goofy as this where the adults still act like adults. They resolve conflicts at work by reading the rules and regulations to each other, kind of like how real adults resolve conflicts at work. In the superhero dominated world of today, they would be punching each other.
* Most movies these days feel about 30 minutes too long for the material they have. This one feels 30 minutes too short. They build an interesting world with compelling characters in a long first act, and then rush the rest. A lot about the creature they are fighting is left frustratingly vague.
* Meg Foster is on wonderful form as a coldhearted corporate executive. She's Reaganomics distilled into one woman. I remember her playing a similar role in They Live (1987). What a thing to be typecast as.

Overall, a solid 7/10 for me, and well worth a tight 98 minutes of your time.",2024-11-10 21:29:29

It's a South Indian (Tamil) movie from 2009, so the CGI is pretty shabby, but the actual storyline is pretty deep. It's about a smuggler named Deva working with his late dad's friend and crew. They smuggle internationally from Africa to Malaysia and have many local rivals. One of these rivals, named Kamalesh, has always strived to be the biggest in the smuggling industry but does it in immoral ways, such as ratting on the competition. How Deva works together with Law enforcement to take down Kamalesh forms the crux of the story. The story works perfectly because it's a mix of comedy, heavy action, and romance while using some pretty deep scientific knowledge throughout the film.

Are we crazy?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gpcdv6/my_wife_and_i_disliked_the_wild_robot_are_we_crazy/,37,"We both loved the director’s previous work, *How to Train Your Dragon*. It’s probably in my top five animated movies I’d recommend to anyone.

We watched Wild Robot yesterday, and neither of us liked it at all. Why?

The story feels like an bland, boring, inconsistent mashup of old clichés. For example, there's a training montage with a pop song playing—surprised it wasn’t “Eye of the Tiger.” Or the classic “listen to your heart, not your mind” message. Meh. Or ""well you have small wing but believe in yourself, and those wise birds will help you"". Yawn.

The plot is full of WTF moments. The robot has half its parts removed by raccoons and somehow keeps functioning perfectly. Then it throws away its heart, main part, near the end and still works fine. They fight off the first ship, but then, for some unexplained reason, call another one. In the greenhouse, a duckling says, “Don’t be afraid, robots can’t hurt you,” and in the next second, battle robots start shooting at the ducks.

At the same time, the movie has a lot of dark undertones. Words like “death,” “die,” “killed,” and “kill” are repeated over and over. The animals are violent, the ducks are racist, humans have destroyed the planet, and they use military robots to protect greenhouses from ducks. Ok I get it, there's no light without the dark. But is there another movie with so many death mentions?

And yet, this movie is universally loved—98% on Rotten Tomatoes, an 8.3 IMDB rating. I don’t get it. Maybe I’m crazy. Or maybe the world is.

The visuals are good, but that’s it.

Nolan doesn't do character-driven stories. His characters are there to propel the plot, the special effects, whatever gimmick he has in store. You might argue that women get it worse than the men, and that may have legitimacy, but it's not as if the men are that great, either. The issue is that he tends to make male-led films but if he, finally, does write a female-led film, I guarantee she'll get the same issues as the male leads do.

Oppenheimer had the luxury of a real-life figure with a fascinating character, and even that film doesn't do him justice. The Joker had Heath Ledger doing a lot of improv for that incarnation to be as iconic as it is. Other than those two, I can't think of a compelling character in any of his films.

movies,1gpa1fv,Why is Blade Runner considered one of the greatest movies ever? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gpa1fv/why_is_blade_runner_considered_one_of_the/,57,"Some context: I'm in my 40's, love scifi and PKD, although I have never read the short story the movie was based on. I somehow have never seen Blade Runner, it was forever on my list, so finally I watched it a couple days ago. I watched the final cut version.


I liked the movie, I would give it a 8/10. What I'm sincerely trying to understand is why is it considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I try to give a rundown on what I think, and I would like to hear the opinions of the fans.


I'd like to divide approach the movie from 3 angles: Presentation, story and themes.


First, presentation. The movie sets, costumes, design and world building is very evocative and well made. I suspect that the authentic and detailed cyberpunk-esque world shown might be one of the big reasons of this movie's status, in which case it is an unfortunate case of the ""Seinfeld is unfunny"" phenomenon, where a once revolutionary never before seen thing becomes copied so many times that the original doesn't evoke the sense of wonder it originally did. Also, it has that special ""80's future"" aesthetic with steam wents, dark crumped places and beeping vector screens, which, alongside with some of the hairstyles, makes it feel a bit ""dated future"". Still I find it really impressive what they did here, the music, the long, quiet shots, the attention to detail for example at the apartment is phenomenal.


Next, let's talk story. This is where I find the movie to be a bit lacking. If you cut off all the decorations (which I already praised in the paragraph above), it's a very basic film noir detective story: a rugged ex cop is going after some fugitives, meeting some rough figures and a mysterious woman in the process, ending in a confrontation that makes him question his values. Pretty basis stuff. Not bad, but nothing special. And I found that the only part with actual detective work (the snakeskin storyline) was in the end meaningless: No matter what Deckard did, the replicants were always going to meet the CEO, kill him and his boss will tell Deckard to go and check out the apartment where the final showdown takes place. The middle part of the story could essentially be skipped.


And finally, the themes, A.K.A ""What is the movie really about"". I think this movie is a fascinating look into what makes us human, and how we choose to live our lives with the knowledge that one day we will die and all of our self becomes nothing. The movie uses the replicant identity to explore these themes. Sure, we are told that the replicants are artificial, but withing the context of the movie, they are pretty much human, except for some superhuman abilities which do not seem to alter their characters at all, so I'm not really paying much attention to them. Oh, and one more thing: they know why they exist, and they also know for certainty that they will die on 4 years. The philosophical side of the movie really kicks in in the last third, when Roy learns that they will die soon and there's nothing anyone can do about it. How can a human mind deal with this? How are we dealing with this day by day? He literally goes through the 5 stages of grief, ending on a deeply touching note with ""acceptance"" and the ""tears in the rain"" monologue. In the end, he was like us. But we don't know how long do we have left. Also, we cannot talk to our creator, he might not even exist. Our existence might be completely random and meaningless. Roy found solace in his ""complete"" existence in the end. Will you (or Deckard) be able to do the same?


This notion is underlined by the film challenging us to face our feelings regarding the human quality of the replicants, best with the (probably infamous) ""rape"" scene. Deckard forces himself on the girl, it is consensual but barely, and even that is arguable by modern sensibilities. Now, if she is just a robot, why are we feel uncomfortable watching this? We don't flinch when seeing someone using a sex toy (well, maybe, it depends), we don't wonder if it's good for the sex toy too. But we feel bad for her. So in this scene, we have unconsciously already sided with the replicants, who, in the end, just want to live. And to quote Oldboy, “Even though I'm no better than a beast, don't I have the right to live?”. First I thought this sex scene was just studio mandate, or 80's machismo with the manly men getting what he wants, but now I think it's a key piece to the puzzle.


So on this front, I think the movie is really a work of art. I would have preferred a LITTLE more ""tell"" to the 95% ""show"" they did, but that's just me, I tend to enjoy seeing onscreen characters having philosophical debates about these things like in Westworld. This is also something that might be affected being done in many movies, books and TV shows since, so the central theme being ""what measure is nonhuman?"" might not have the punch it did when the movie came out, sadly.


So, summing it all up, I would say presentation is 8/10, Story is 5/10, and the themes are 10/10. So I end up with an 8/10 movie. I'm happy I saw it, it gave me some stuff to think about while falling asleep, and it had really evocative visuals. What I'm trying to understand is, why is this considered one of the best movies of all time and has the following it does? Please tell me your perspective!

Ending - the version I just watched (and which seems to be cannon) ends with the reporter turning into Al Pacino with a ""vanity's my favorite sin"" comment and then credits roll.

What I remember - the ending was a repeat of the early bar/parking scene when Leamon Heath approaches, but this time stating they have a place for a lawyer with such good conscience and Kevin is considering to accept the offer once again before credits roll.

Does anyone know anything about this alternate version? What/where/how?

That's its not just my own figment of imagination, I re-watched it with a person who did see it with me 15 years ago and they were as confused by the different ending as I was.

Ending is definitely the biggest change. The other one may have been down to translation - basically the means through which Kevin learns that Alex is guilty - in the cannon cut it's down to his assistant not being sure whether he is circumcised, while in the version I have originally seen she just mentions that she just wasn't sure about the time of the encounter and implied that she was willing to say whatever's needed.

Drawing out the series for an extra film.

When that made endless money, other YA series followed suit with The Hunger Games and Twilight. Quickly the trend wore on audiences, to the point that Divergent's split 3rd book did not get it's Part Two made due to Part One being a disappointment.

With these disappointments, Marvel changed their Infinity War Part One and Two, to Infinity War and Endgame. 

Recently Dune was marketed and sold as Dune. Only for the first moment of the film to announce it as actually Part One of a series.

Mission Impossible marketed it's final films as Dead Reckoning Part One, but has now switched it's Part Two to The Final Reckoning, likely due to Part One's box office disappointment

movies,1go0nsp,Binoche and Fiennes Talk Pasolini’s New Odyssey-Inspired Movie,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1go0nsp/binoche_and_fiennes_talk_pasolinis_new/,2,"“The English patient” and “Wuthering Heights” co-stars Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes meet again as another iconic on-screen couple, this time incarnating Odysseus and Penelope in Uberto Pasolini’s new movie, “The Return”, described as an out-of-the-box re-telling of the last rhapsody of Homer’s epic, The Odyssey.



Following a world first at Toronto in September, the movie had its Greek premiere at Thessaloniki International Film Festival on Saturday, in the presence of the director and the lead actors, who answered questions during a press conference moderated by the Festival’s head of programming, Yorgos Krassakopoulos.



The previous day, Binoche and Fiennes had received honorary Golden Alexander awards for being “not just great actors, but also two courageous explorers of human feelings, pioneers of their art, genuine narrators of unique stories,” as explained by the Festival’s Artistic Director, Orestis Andreadakis.



Work in progress for thirty years

“The Return” director Uberto Pasolini disclosed that he had been thinking about making a movie on the Odyssey for thirty years until he finally approached the starring duo with a proposal.



“That is to say, 10 years longer than it took Odysseus to battle in Troy, to embark on his return, to engage in love affairs with the Mediterranean’s most beautiful women, to kill 108 suitors, at least according to Homer, and at last, end up within Penelope’s arms. In our film we had to murder far fewer men, I’d like for that to be noted,” the director joked.



“When I was invited to join Odysseus’s “dance,” I went along. It was all very beautiful: the writing, the dialogues and, of course, the idea of working with Ralph again,” Binoche commented.



Fiennes pointed out that the movie script held no surprises, as the Odyssey was a story he had known since he was a child, but he had to understand the director’s version which focused on the hero’s inner struggle.



“Uberto has managed to imbue his characters with psychological depth, offering us a beautiful challenge,” the acclaimed actor said.

  
Filming in Greece for Pasolini’s Odyssey movie

Filming for “The Return” took place primarily on Corfu and in the Peloponnese, aided by Greek co-producer Kostantinos Kontovrakis, who found it “incredibly important for a Greek producer to have the opportunity to make a movie based on the Odyssey epic, and to preserve the values keeping it relevant and timely.”



Working with Pasolini, Fiennes and Binoche was “a dream come true” for him.



For the leading duo, it was very important to visit the Greek locations before filming, in order to get to know the people and familiarize with the process.



“I’ve been to Ithaca twice, it is a place that exudes such a powerful energy,” said Fiennes. The actor has traveled extensively in Greece, especially in the Peloponnese.



“I find your country exceptional. There is a tremendous energy that I can identify with, which you can find on the islands, in its seas and landscapes, in its topography and mountains. Powerful spirits dwell over there. I experience a similar feeling on the west coast of Ireland,” Fiennes shared.



The acclaimed actor saw “The Return” as a profound experience. In his own words, “some roles are literally impossible to describe.”



Odysseus’ inner struggle put on screen

“The Return” has been from the start the story of a family reunion, according to Pasolini.



“Most of all, it is an odyssey of the mind and spirit, not a literal journey. This is the real inner struggle of Odysseus, and as the script evolved, more emphasis was placed on the inner conflicts and problems of the family. We focused more on the people rather than the myths,” he stated.



Fiennes describes his role of Odysseus as a man who painstakingly arrives home after much suffering, unsure if he can stay: “A man who is mentally shattered by all the hardships of the journey, an inner journey that goes through Penelope, with whom he is at a tragic impasse, as they are unable to reconnect after all they have been through.”



“All of us, in one way or another, are seeking our very own personal Ithaca. Odyssey speaks to us all about the struggle to return. We are all on a journey and return is the question we carry within us,” he reflected on the deeper meaning of the movie.



For Binoche, the long-awaited return to Ithaca is irrespective of the form it may take or the meaning it may hold for each person. To her, teaming up with Ralph Fiennes – in what she believes, judging by age, could consist their last film together – and having been able to turn Uberto Pasolini’s vision into reality, was landing up at a personal Ithaca.



Homeric Penelope’s similarities to a modern woman

Despite the fact that The Odyssey was written more than 2,600 years ago, its most iconic female character, Penelope, a universal symbol of spousal love and fidelity, draws more similarities to a modern woman than one would imagine.



For Juliette Binoche, Penelope’s greatest challenge was maintaining her mental health.



“Penelope faces a nightmare day in and day out, pretending that everything is fine. She is much more complicated than a woman who is just awaiting her husband’s return. She must employ a cunning way to deal with the dark side of humanity. You never confront the devil face to face, but sideways. And thus, she manages to deal with a situation that would otherwise destroy her,” she observes.



Answering what her role as Penelope adds to the image of the modern woman, Binoche said that is “a deeply personal matter,” which resonates with different kinds of women, in a variety of ways.

  
“Penelope, even as an archetype, is a very modern woman. She embarks on her own journey and comes face to face with what it means to have faith. The patience required of this woman is immense,” the French star commented.



“If we try to form parallels between the story and today’s standards, we would say it is an attempt of coordinating and bringing together our feminine and masculine sides, but also an attempt to return to the essence, to the heart of ourselves, to home. As such, although a classic work, it remains more contemporary than ever,” Binoche stressed.



Odyssey’s multiple interpretations reflected in movie

Pasolini added to Binoche’s remarks on her heroine that Homer’s works are open to multiple interpretations, and, from a feminist standpoint, there are two ways to interpret it.



“The first is that Penelope is a woman submissive in nature, while the second, which makes more sense to me, is that Penelope is a woman who makes her choices. Penelope is in charge of what is going on in the island. She has the power to make decisions, she changes the course of events, she is a woman fully capable of taking on responsibilities,” the director believes.



On the subject of distractions in Odysseus’ journey, Pasolini argued that for the hero, the main internal struggle has to do with violence: “Although a man who avoids and abhors violence, Odysseus eventually confronts the obligation to turn to it”.



On Fiennes’ opinion, “it’s a terrible violation of his humanity, hiding within it a relentless question: when is it okay to utilize violence in order to get what you want?”



“By the finale, we all want him to get his house back from the suitors, who are the representation of the malevolent forces trying to grasp something that doesn’t belong to them. Odysseus knows he must resort to violence. I often return to the text of the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna speaks to the warrior prince Arjuna about his sacred duty to fight. Our destiny and our destination are always greater than the small battles that scare us. I believe that Odysseus too must enter this zone of violence to complete his sacred duty,” the on-screen Odysseus concluded.

movies,1gnqcpf,The Virgin Suicides (1999) - Hauntingly Beautiful [Spoilers and Discussion],110,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnqcpf/the_virgin_suicides_1999_hauntingly_beautiful/,22,"I've just seen this a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. 

  
It's one of my favourite films so far and I can't believe this was Sofia Coppola's directorial debut.   
  
I wanted to mention some of the things I found interesting and loved about it in a short summary in this post. 

* The presentation of the Lisbon sisters and some of the shots were absolutely amazing, completely atmospheric and sucks you in completely. 
* The score by Air sets the tone for the movie and they stand out on their own as amazing tracks too. My favs would be [Playground Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFuu5wPFv1M) or [Highschool Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXFEVqi4iPE), [Ce matin-là](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRoBfcPxJdA) and [Empty House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCRo8RLZ8dA) at the end.. 

   * Sofia actually met her future and current husband Thomas Mars on set as he was the vocalist for Playground Love :) 
* The ending itself was such a sucker punch too, we knew it was coming and still it hit so hard. 

* [Leslie Hayman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371353/) who plays Therese Lisbon (stunning btw) seems to have not pursued acting after The Virgin Suicides. Her sister [Stephanie Hayman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371364/?ref_=tt_ov_wr_1) seems to have co-written a 14 minute short with Sofia Coppola, I assume that's how Leslie was connected to Sofia. The same goes for the boys in [Lee Kagan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0434574/) and [Noah Shebib(40)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790520/) who is a record producer now.  [Anthony DeSimone](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221254/) also has not had any major roles after this movie it seems.
* The film is based on the book by Jeffrey Eugenides but the script was written solely for the movie. Although the movie is not based on true stories, it was inspired by a girl who was babysitting Jeffrey's nephew and claimed [""that she and her sisters had all attempted suicide""](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/11/jeffrey-eugenides-virgin-suicides-kirsten-dunce-sofia-coppola).  

I just can't get over how a fictional story felt so real it was like a living dream.. from the presentation of the girls that still haunts me but is just so beautiful, the scene where the boys read Cecilia's diary (when Ce matin-là plays) to the dance scene and the girls' eventual demise. I haven't been hooked by a movie like this in a long time and consider this my love letter to The Virgin Suicides. I will definitely rewatch this movie some time soon and I'm looking forward to watching Sofia's other works, I've already watched Somewhere and Lost In Translation so far :) 

P.S. I also had a question about the cast, who plays Diana Porter in the movie? She seems really familiar but I don't know. Couldn't find it in the credits too.

But the amount of films that are completely mistreated or undervalued because of so many factors of the academy is a completely other thing. I guess the best concise example is how the English patient beat Fargo, because people were worried about looking unintelligent voting for a film that had funny accents. 

Also, the historic inability of the Oscars to treat something like horror or comedy seriously, we should engineer an Oscar ceremony that takes place maybe 10 or 20 years after the release of the film. 

It would be so great to have a historic lens on the impact of the art and the impact of that art on society, and revisit it in a way where we can award things fairly with more perspective.

Is anyone ever tried to do this? What would stop someone from creating this sort of celebration?",2024-11-09 17:40:15
movies,1gosvwj,I've watched almost 200 unseen movies as part of a weekly challenge for myself. What should be my 200th movie? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gosvwj/ive_watched_almost_200_unseen_movies_as_part_of_a/,22,"Since April 2021, I've engaged in a personal challenge where once a week I watch one film I haven't watched before; an unseen movie. It can be a newly released film or it can be decades old; it just has to be one I haven't watched yet. I've watched plenty of films before doing this and honestly my number of total films I've watched is probably closer to 500 at least.

But anyway, sometime in December I will be watching my 200th film as part of my weekly challenge. My problem is that I want it to be a really good film to celebrate doing this for almost 200 weeks (It's probably more like 195 weeks but whatever). My 100th film was Good Will Hunting, which was probably one of the best films I watched in 2023, so I'm looking for something along the lines of that in terms of a classic movie.

So with all that in mind, what you recommend be my 200th film?

I have a list of all the films I've watched as part of my challenge, which is fairly diversified. I said my total film count is higher but just assume these are the only ones I've watched. Or if you want, make an educated guess at what films I've already seen based on the list.

movies,1go6lss,Let's discuss Pinocchio and Emperor of the Night ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1go6lss/lets_discuss_pinocchio_and_emperor_of_the_night/,1,"Alright people, remember in 87 when Filmation made a pseudo disney sequel called Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night?? The movie stars lots of famous people like James Earl Jones, Ed Asner, Frank Welker, and Rickie Lee Jones. The movie takes place a year after Pinocchio turns into a human, crazy. Scott Grimes from American Dad was Pinocchio... Gosh like why didn't American Dad reference this movie?? I also heard that it's got nightmare fuel elements as well. Like people have said that Pinocchio turning back into a puppet scared them as kids, like did Scott Grimes know that this was going to be terrifying, like geez Scott ask Lou if it was going to be... I wonder if the people making this got inspiration from **Return to Oz** because maybe of the heads in glass cases scene and because of the scary imagery as well. Also because of sticking to the books, maybe...

First off if Pinocchio is only like a year old, how does he have the ability to walk and talk, did the blue fairy give him the power to do so?? If Pinocchio was like only one year old, then he'd probably babble a lot and he'd have to learn to walk, Pinocchio would probably fall down a lot if he had to deliver that jewel box to the Mayer.  Did the emperor give Pinocchio the power to turn into a real boy or maybe his body is special...

Second why was Pinocchio in the sudden urge to have fun when entering the Neon Cabaret he was looking for the jewel box??

Did the crew/animators of this movie also stick to the original source material like the original Pinocchio story besides the Disney one?? I learnt from the 1911 Pinocchio there was a Land of Toys place, which the Land Where Dreams Come True had it

Probably in the year prior, the blue fairy found Pinocchio as a puppet sitting on the counter and the fairy godmother turned him to a real boy. 

But the most popular question that got people wondering for years was, ""Was Twinkle an actual girl that got turned into a puppet??"" because of her ability to sing as a puppet. Poor Twinkle, I'm pretty sure she must've wanted a friend

Pretty sure he'd need Geppetto to hold his hand for going places cause that's very dangerous for someone like him to do. Pinocchio sure didn't know about the dangers of going off with strangers

Considering this was based of Carlo Collodi's story, It would've made sense for there to be picture books to go with the film haha

This Pinocchio adaptation was kind of also known for ripping off the Disney version

Gosh I kind of wish to see more behind the scenes making of this movie, like pics of the actors working on the movie..

I'm much more in tune with the music industry, and generally, singers have their own labels if they want more creative freedom over what they put out and ownership of their music. They also tend to sign other artists to their label. On the other hand, artists who have significant leverage over their music but aren't interested in running a label can simply sign with a premier record label. But when I see directors' production companies, they mostly seem to produce only their own films. Is there a financial advantage for them in producing their own films? Is it about creative freedom? And most importantly, couldn't their films just be produced and financed solely by other established production companies, similar to how artists in the music industry sign with a premier record label?",2024-11-11 08:39:55

I honestly found this movie to be so relatable as a young woman. I also had a close friend that I lived with for years and felt in very similar ways to the main character, Frances. I thought it was interesting how Sophie would tell Frances one thing and then turn around and live out another reality. I wonder if this is a shared experienced many women feel or if this was just a character trait to help us understand the differences between the women? Maybe this was to show what it’s like to follow one’s dreams versus falling into pre-existing patterns we believe and are told to be “the right way”.

movies,1gn9h1y,Christmas with the Kranks: 20 Years on From This Bizarre Dystopian Dreamscape,609,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gn9h1y/christmas_with_the_kranks_20_years_on_from_this/,211,"Christmas with the Kranks (2004) turns 20 in a few days.

I sat down to watch it without really knowing what I was getting in to. I'd been told it was camp, that it was pretty goofy and off-kilter, and it's Tim Allen in 2004, what do you expect.

Christmas with the Kranks is a damning condemnation of Bush's America. It's about the sublimation of the individual into the community, about the impossibility of true freedom, about the ways in which cheer and joy and neighbourly spirit can be weaponised to keep people in line. Let me explain a little.

The premise is pretty simple. Luther and Nora Krank, two extremely ordinary American parents, decide to skip Christmas and go on a cruise. As part of this decision, they decide not to do anything Christmas-related at all - no gifts, no parties, no cards. They're pretty respectful and open with telling people about it, and at no point until deep in the film do anything wrong at all. Incensed, the community apply an escalating series of tactics in an attempt to change the Kranks' minds. Eventually, with the revelation that their daughter Blair is coming home for Christmas unexpectedly, Luther (who has been adamant about this) and Nora (who has been reluctantly towed along) flip and throw their typical Christmas party. The community, who have been monolithic, abusive and coercive, now apply their same relentless energy to throwing the party after all, and it ends up being perfect.

So, classic Christmas movie - a few capers, some side-plots that don't really go anywhere, so what?

Because this isn't really about this. This movie is about how society breaks a man.

Luther's tiny transgression in his simple defiance of 'community spirit' is the greatest possible affront to this community. It is inconceivable that anyone could want to break with tradition. And the film is seemingly disinterested in addressing the religious aspect of the holiday - the entire focus is on how one decorates one's McMansion, the presence of a plastic snowman on the roof, and an enormous tree in the living room. Luther's attempt at indifference is treated as heresy. They will do anything they can to make him conform. Nora feels an even greater pressure, as she is unable to escape the community: while Luther takes shelter in his work, Nora is ""on the front lines"", as she puts it. Rendered passive by her role as a homemaker and parent (the only thing that brings real (and hyperbolic) joy), Nora has nothing to distract her from this peer pressure.

The film appears to suggest that the Kranks really will escape, that their resilience and rejection of coercion will be rewarded with a cruise in the Caribbean. But Blair's return shatters this. Now they risk alienating not only their nosy neighbours, but also the next generation, one seemingly even more indoctrinated into community spirit and secular ritual (there is a hysteria around Blair's love for these Christmas parties, the ham, the caramel cream pie et al that drives Nora to all manner of humiliating extremes).

And in this Christmas party preparation, when the entire cadre rallies together to set up the party, that the film bravely acknowledges the cognitive dissonance that Luther is feeling. After the family are all together, Nora gives a toast, thanking everyone for everything. But Luther, a Tim Allen staple, always wise-cracking and witty, is literally speechless. He retreats into the kitchen to drink alone. Nora, who has by now fully drank the Kool-Aid, berates him, practically threatening him with divorce. Driven by an urgent and subconscious desire to experience something sincere, he looks across the street, where his awful old neighbour and his wife are eating alone. He ambles across, gives them the tickets to the cruise, and then wanders back out into the street.

In the street, clad all in black, a shadow against the snow, Luther Krank is alone for the first time in a long time. He stares in through his own window, seeing his family, but feeling as a stranger to them. He has suffered so much, been abused and gaslit and coerced, for such a minor offence. A wide shot of the empty street teases him, tempting him with the possibility of freedom, of leaving it all behind.

But then Nora comes out, and they share some platitude about Christmas spirit, and how ""maybe next year"" they'll skip Christmas *for real*. And then Luther goes back into the party, and that is the end of him. Oh, and then Santa, who was actually at the party, flies off into the sky.

The story of the Kranks is a tragedy wrapped up in red and green fairy lights. It is an extremely jarring film conceptually and in its execution. Many scenes feel like they are from cult horror films like Midsommar and Get Out. The Kranks only seem to experience real joy and happiness when planning to escape. The sexlessness of their marriage, personified by Nora's Christmas vest, is synonymous with their participation in the community. Any changes in aesthetic, in behaviour, in dress sense are ruthlessly picked apart, even in the local newspaper. Luther Krank cannot escape this bullying even at work. Nora Krank cannot escape this coercion even in her home. Most sinister of all, their daughter Blair seems not only unaware but also revels in this same spirit that is clearly crushing her parents. Lenin said, ""Give us the child for 8 years and it will be a Bolshevik forever."" Well, I say give the child 8 Christmases under Frosty the Snowman, and it will be a neighbourhood watchman forever. It's very fitting that the instant they decide to flip, Nora puts the vest right back on, and with it resumes the puritanical, moralistic and submissive identity she has been submerged into all her life.

What is the message of this film? It's hard to say. It is explicitly contradictory in how the first and second halves of the film work, and the effects that these events have on the Kranks. On the surface, the moral seems to be ""be a good neighbour and be selfless, and buy lots of ham at Christmas time"". But I think its real message is much more sinister. 2004 was a time of great fear and paranoia in the American psyche. Their values were seemingly under attack, their soldiers were fighting and dying in Iraq, the government was openly spying on them. Luther and Nora's hopeful optimism cannot survive in such times. Under the long shadow of 9/11, American suburbia was more vulnerable than ever. Any breach of community spirit was treason. It's difficult to say whether this film is a precursor to Shapiro et al's ""War on Christmas"" BS that gets pedalled out every year, but it's expressing a similar sentiment.

It seems fitting to end this with the contents of my very lazy Letterboxd review, which I thought was pretty funny:  
*“He gazed up at the enormous white beard. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the gleaming white beard. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. Luther Krank loved Santa Claus.”*

TLDR Watch this movie. It will sit with you a lot more than you might expect (even if it is a bit of a hot mess.)

Thanks for reading. This was a bit of a ramble. Merry Christmas.

*Edit: RE Adaptation and 9/11. Just because the novel that this is based on was written before 9/11 does not mean that the film adaptation from 2004 can't be influenced by it. Every adaptation, even the most faithful, by necessity will make changes, conscious or unconscious, that are a product of the time period and the psyche of the people making the adaptation. It is genuinely impossible to change the medium of a story and preserve the meaning and intention original text identically. You can disagree with me if you want, but I believe that this film's politics reflect the zeitgeist of the War on Terror in a big way.* ",2024-11-09 12:53:08

The Fast and The Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Tokyo Drift are essentially Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. In these first three movies, we are introduced to all of our main heroes off doing their own thing. And then Fast and Furious comes along to unite them all against a singular foe.

2. Maid 
3. Unorthodox 

All three shows follow a similar plot of women coming out of unhealthy relationships and finding their way around life on their own and the kind of people they met on the way, the journey of self discovery and finding that freedom and independence and facing the challenges that come with it.

movies,1gogl63,"Last night, I watched ""I Lost My Body"" (2019)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gogl63/last_night_i_watched_i_lost_my_body_2019/,0,"This movie made me cry a lot. There were so many powerful scenes, especially at the very end when we see young Naoufel run on the beach with his arms out like an airplane. We saw an airplane when he attended his parents’ funeral, so maybe there’s a deeper meaning here. Maybe there was nothing to the way the child ran on the beach with his arms extended. 

However, one scene confounds me. After Naoufel jumps to that crane, we see his hand starts retreating. I can’t understand this at all. 

Another question: It’s not apparent to me that he had any guilt on his parents’ death. I know he was very upset. What evidence is there that he felt guilt? 

Also, here are points that I’ve noticed, and I’d love your views as well:

* Towards the end, when the hand was using an umbrella to navigate, it encounters an astronaut which gives him guidance. The astronaut points the direction for the hand to go. 
* The only time a fly was caught was when he had his hand severed. His severed hand briefly caught a fly, and then, the fly escaped. 
* When  Naoufel leaves Gigi, Gabrielle lays on his bed and explores his old personal space. Gabrielle also listens to his recording, and she smiles. This implies to me that she clearly had feelings for him, but it’s not apparent if they are romantic. 
* The instance Naoufel has feelings for Gabrielle is while he was delivering her a pizza. She asked him if he was OK. 
* Naoufel revisits the most auspicious and emotional place for him, and that’s on the rooftop by the wooden igloo. That’s where he spent a very special time with Gabrielle. He revealed his feelings of love to her basically. And that’s where he returned to reclaim his life, break free from his parents’ death, and maybe accept the loss of his hand and the loss of Gabrielle (**I’m not sure about this, however.**)
* It’s very peculiar that even Gabrielle doesn’t live with her parents. We never knew the circumstances of her parents. 
* Naoufel meets Gabrielle, and we realize that Raof is his relative. I’m not sure if Gabrielle thought that Raof was boyfriend material. She may have found him sexy or charismatic. 
* What illness does Gigi have? Gabrielle implied that he was sick. 
* I am not familiar with the book “The World According to Garp,” but I have a feeling that there’s symbolism in that book. What do you think is the significance, if any, of this book?
* During Naoufel‘a parents’ funeral, we see Naoufel wearing a cast. There’s a man right behind him also wearing a cast. What does this symbolize? What’s this about?",2024-11-11 01:28:27

I know directors will often work with the same teams of people across different movies, but that can't be it. I almost see the director as more of a project manager overseeing the whole production, but I know that takes away a lot of their artistic contribution.

So what do you look for in a movie or dp you assess the work of the director in a movie without attributing everyone else's work to one person?

Gotham is just soooooo grimey and corrupt. It's such a lived in city, with such a last days of the Roman empire vibes.

I think what stood out the second time of viewing is just how much Bruce Wayne/Batman has dis-associated from society and although so succinct in his mission of ""cleaning up Gotham"", he is still searching for a purposeful way of doing it.

I think a legitimate critism of Batman is that he is an ultra rich man with a lot of soft power in gotham, so it's weird that he only goes after low level criminals and doesn't fix the larger issues plaguing Gotham. This movie definitely fixes that by bridging the connection between both blue and white collar crimes, but it also fleshes out how Batman (in the 2nd year of being Batman) is still trying to figure out the best way to fix the city, it even shows him realising his approach is flawed.

The batmobile car chase is absolutely amazing. From the point of the engine revving up and the reaction of the penguin and his goons realising it's the Batman their up against literally gives me goosebumps everytime I see it.

movies,1gnhqj5,James Newton Howard elevated M. Night Shyamalan,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnhqj5/james_newton_howard_elevated_m_night_shyamalan/,31,"I watched Trap recently and was kind of astounded at how bad the second half was, and it got me reflecting on the enigma that is M. Night. On how someone can have such quality films and then some of the worst movies ever. I feel like it's been mostly misses for the past decade, and then I had the realization that M. Night has not had his former frequent collaborator James Newton Howard compose a movie for him for over a decade. 

And it got me reflecting on those older films again and the impact that music had on them, and I truly believe James pulled those films into a higher tier of quality than they would have been without him. Even some of his stinkers have some of the most beautiful musical moments I've ever seen on film (the hand scene in The Village for example). And I think without James' signature stamp his movies would have been much less memorable, subconsciously even, and even the films that people consider his good work. Now you could maybe try to refute that claim by pointing to Last Airbender and After Earth being omega dumped on despite the music, but perhaps those were kind of the end of the ""facade"", the straws that broke the camel's back, where his consistent inconsistency was shining through finally and the music could do nothing to save them after a decade. Those movies happened to be their last together. You could never argue that the Last Airbender music isn't amazing though (seriously, go listen to that soundtrack it's incredible). 

And now it's been a decade of duds, maybe with the exception of Split, but the soundtrack of Split has moments VERY reminiscent of James (the train scene for example is James' style to a tee, and that's probably the best/most evoking scene he has filmed the past decade which goes back to my point). 

I've always had a soft spot for Shyamalan's older works, even the stinkers, and I've realized I think that is greatly contributed to James Newton Howard's genius. If Trap had been the same exact movie but with a banger James score on it, I think it would have been elevated to a point of giving a pass on some of the ridiculous shit. And I think that's what we as moviegoers have done with his older works. 

TLDR: James Newton Howard is a fucking genius ",2024-11-09 19:24:02
movies,1gmtefc,What fictional character do you think experienced the worst character assasination when being adapted for film?,756,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gmtefc/what_fictional_character_do_you_think_experienced/,732,"Basically, who was a great fully dimensional character in the book and then got adapted into something terrible?
This could be from a good or bad adaptation, it doesn't matter. I'll throw my hat in the ring first:

Mike Hanlon from IT.

Mike in the book is the only black kid in all of Derry, but he has a warm and idyllic homelife that balances it all out. He's smart and researches history in his free time, he loves his daddy with all his heart and he loves his friends even more. As an adult he's very lonely but he still remains very hopeful that one day IT will meet its demise. When Henry Bowers, his racist childhood bully meets him again in the library with a knife, Mike still has the empathy to understand Henry is mentally ill and being used as a puppet. He tries to talk to him and call the police so he can safely be returned back to the mental hospital but it obviously goes south.

In the it 2016 continuity Mike is none of those things.
Mike is legitimately a crazy person in IT chapter 2, and the film makers replaced his lovely childhood with his parents with sheep murder and fire and guns. His historian stuff is given to Ben for literally no reason, in it chapter 2 he lies to his friends repeatedly and even DRUGS BILL. He also steals native american artifacts when he probably could have to told the tribe ""hey man I know it didn't work the first time ya'll tried it but can I try it again? I have literally nothing to lose."". His confrontation with Henry in the library just culminates in him beating the crap out of him and almost dying, nothing to humanize Henry or show Mike's empathy. He doesn't even really get to do anything while everyone else goes on stupid little spirit journeys. 

Honorable mention to Stanley too, who in the book saves the losers lives at times, has a silly but strange sense of humor, and kills himself because he genuinely is so terrified of IT, movie stanley spends the whole movie bitching and complaining about everything, kills himself for ""the good of the group"", and is even describe by Richie as ""the weakest of us"". Booooo. 

I'm not gonna sit here and say everything in the IT book is fantastic, or that stephen king is fantastic at writing black characters (even stephen king admits his pitfalls there) but jesus god! This is all made even worse by the fact when the muschiettis were developing it they considered making Mike a crack addict as adult. They later go some serious and well deserved backlash for that.

So anyways, who do you think got character assinated in an adaptation?",2024-11-08 21:18:51

But I could never figure out how/why Ryan Gosling’s character was convincing Mark Baum to buy the swaps.

My understanding of swaps is (in a gross oversimplification) that it’s sort of like options in that if the event occurs the buyer of the swap makes money while the seller of the swap loses money. But if it doesn’t happen then the buyer loses the cost of the swap (though more complicated because the buyer could have to pay more throughout the time).


So why was Ryan so hell bent on selling the swaps and then why did he make a fat check at the end?  What was his characters position? What happened if mark didn’t buy the swaps from him?


I hope this doesn’t break rule 12.

Edit: woah stayed off reddit for a whole two hours and came back to finally getting my answer.  He had too many swaps and was selling some to offset the risk and possible illiquidity. 

For those still confused I didn’t see a comment that said this so hopefully this helps:  Burry throughout the process kept changing the white board to reflect the decreasing value of his fund as he way paying off the premiums from the increased price (or value) of the MBS/CDOs. Investors panicked and tried pulling out (which burry stopped). Jared (Gosling) had the same problem but couldn’t keep his bosses from pulling the plug so he had to sell some of his swaps to Baum to limit his risk (and decrease the monthly premiums)",2024-11-08 14:59:13

Commentary: Lovecraft, tentacles, stuck in place, fog. Fucking A+ movie. Best served with an authentic super burrito and coke zero.


&nbsp;

Spawn's Score: 8

Commentary: Obnoxious livestreamer goes to a haunted house alone and shit happens. Put on your PJ's and grab some salty popcorn.


&nbsp;

**The Dark and The Wicked (2020)**

Spawn's Score: 8

Commentary: If you liked When Evil Lurks you will like this bad boy grab yourself a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoy the evil slow burn.

&nbsp;

**A Dark Song (2016)**

Spawn's Score: 7.5

Commentary: This movie deals in the occult dark magic. This is an intensely dark movie therefore Steak and Red Wine is the recommendation. 

&nbsp;

**Dark Skies (2013)**

Spawn's Score 7.5

Commentary: What if the things that are not of this world were fucking scary? An intense film that escalates and escalates until it culminates into a satisfactory climax. Popcorn of the buttery variety, don't forget the coke zero.

&nbsp;

**The Blair Witch Project (1999)**

Spawn's Score: 7.6

Commentary: Considered by many the Godfather of found footage films, grab some buttery popcorn and watch these fucking fools running around a forest while weird creepy shit happens.

&nbsp;

**Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County (1998)**

Spawn's Score: 5.5

Commentary: Did you think the Blair Witch Project invented found footage? Wrong! This shit right here was released a whole year earlier! It's about what's in the fucking title, it probably had fucking garbage budget, watch these fools freak out over a laser pointer it's awesome. Best served with salted diced tomatoes, salami and chardonnay. Pro-tip: AKA The McPherson tape this shit is available for free on youtube.
 
&nbsp;


**The Substance (2024)**

&nbsp;

**IT (2017)**

Commentary: King's fucking murderous clowns. A modern classic of horror films. Has Stranger Things vibes for obvious reasons so if you like that you will love this. Thin pepperoni pizza and watch it in 4k.

&nbsp;

**The Shining (1980)**

Spawn's Score: 9

Commentary: Truthfully I've always liked the one no one talks about as a kid. But as a less regarded adult pretender I now understand my misguided ways, hot chocolate on a particularly cold night.

&nbsp;

**Evil Dead (2013)**

Spawn's Score: 8.7

Commentary: The remake of a classic that actually is good. This shit is fun, it's action packed. It's also fucking disgusting, in fact legend says this movie had the most fucking blood out of all movies ever. Do you like blood with your horror movies? Then you like this shit. Enjoy with fish and chips plus hazy IPA beer, don't forget the tartar sauce.

&nbsp;

**The Descent (2005)**

Spawn's Score: 7.5

Commentary: Like Hereditary, this a reddit favorite thru and thru. Grab yourself a few tacos, make a Mojito and watch these cave hiking women get stuck in a fucking cave with creepy scary shit inside.

&nbsp;

**V/H/S and V/H/S2 (2012 and 2013)**

Spawn's Score: 6 and 7

Commentary: Bunch of unrelated short horror segments are played over an overarching ""story"". The first 2 V/H/S has some of the best segments but later V/H/S movies also have some good shit. Standout segment: Safe Haven from V/H/S2. If you could only watch one of the segments this would be the one, fucking creepy cultists are interviewed and shit gets wild(the very ending is fucking hilarious though). Salty popcorn for this one.

&nbsp;

**Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)**

Spawn's Score: 8.5

Commentary: A classic not only of horror but of movies in general. The birth of a cultural icon. Put on your PJ's, grab some hot chocolate and enjoy on a rainy night right before bed or in bed. Sweet dreams.

&nbsp;

**The Fog (1980)**

Spawn's Score: 8.3

Commentary: Can't have The Mist in the list and not have The Fog. Did you like The Mist? Do you like creepy fog and the unnatural? Then you will like this shit. Best enjoyed with ice cold Sauvignon Blanc, salami and diced heart of palm.

since more than two weeks I'm on a filmic journey through Europe. Following the official list of europen countries by the Council of Europe in alphabetical order, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain country everyday. Yesterday was all about france and in an act that I would almost describe as a photo finish, I have now been able to determine the winner of our France round. I would have put my money on second-placed Amelie, but instead of this,  ***La Haine*** is the winner after 24 hours.

Thank you  very much to the many participants. There were only a few double nominations in the comments and even fewer comments that named several films at once. The turnout was extremely high and the race was really exciting. I can't wait to see what it will be like today: We are looking for your favorite movie set in **Georgia**. As everytime, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,1gmpe80,I genuinely enjoyed Trap (2024),545,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gmpe80/i_genuinely_enjoyed_trap_2024/,488,"I decided to watch M. Night Shyamalan’s newest film, Trap, last night. Prior to watching the movie I was unaware of the plot or premise and the only info I knew was that it was M. Night’s newest film. His movies have always been hit or miss for me but I figured I’d go in with an open mind and give it a fair shake. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible while describing my thoughts on the film. 

The first act had some great suspense building as the main character begins to realize just what he is in for. Josh Hartnett was phenomenal as he balanced two different characters, one of which only the audience is aware of, through the first and second act. Shots of Hartnett that framed his face from forehead to chin was a great way to show his superb facial expressions while acting this complex character (can someone say smiling eyes). 

The premise was unique, although a little similar to classic law enforcement/criminal cat and mouse type stuff. It wasn’t overly unrealistic or fantastical and felt at least possible if not probable throughout the film (maybe except the ending). 

The third act was the weakest point of the film from a plot perspective, which has been typical for M. Night films (at least IMO) for the last decade at least. The acting on the other hand was turned up a few notches towards the end and I was loving it. The pop star wasn’t as bad of an actor as people are making her out to be and I thought she carried the emotional weight (along with Hartnett’s family) of the climax very well. 

The ending was okay, I’ll admit. A little over the top and the realism for sure dropped off right before the credits, but overall I enjoyed the suspense, the premise, the acting, and the culmination. I’ve read a lot of hate on this film and I think much of it is unwarranted. Curious to hear anyone else’s thoughts. ",2024-11-08 18:26:56
movies,1gnj85w,20 years ago I took a film class (Aesthetics of Film) that focused on the Uncanny Valley,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnj85w/20_years_ago_i_took_a_film_class_aesthetics_of/,14,"From Wikipedia…

“The uncanny valley effect is a hypothesized psychological and aesthetic relation between an object's degree of resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to the object. Examples of the phenomenon exist among robotics, 3D computer animations and lifelike dolls. The increasing prevalence of digital technologies (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation) has propagated discussions and citations of the ""valley""; such conversation has enhanced the construct's verisimilitude. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting eerie feelings in viewers.”

----

I have a list of what are definitely my favorite films of all time. I'm not actually suggesting I don't do this behavior when I'm watching those films, but immediately off hand I think of no country for old men, alien, ex machina, annihilation, midsommar, and the thing as my favorite films. Ever. 

And I think I do it with those, but it's been a little bit and I have to lean into what I've just been watching. 

When I watch Jaws, and when I watch the Casino Royale remake with Daniel Craig, I find myself during the entire film muttering how much I love the film. There are so many little things and nuances and moments that bring so much joy narratively or cinematically or as Easter eggs where I keep muttering that I love the film. I feel like every time I watch Jaws I learn something new about filmmaking and cinematography and directing and acting. I just realized the Spanish ladies song is an ode to the pequod and Moby Dick. I'm 48 and I've missed that my entire life and Moby Dick is one of my favorite three books of all time.

Do you have favorite films that you know you love as some of the best ever, but do you ever re-engineer what your favorite films are based off of the fact when you are watching them you keep telling yourself how much you love it?

Horror movies tend to be very lucrative investment because of their low budgets and they are not expected to be a blockbuster but somehow that low budget production value adds some type of aesthetic to it just like the OG Texas Chainsaw Massacre did in the 70s.

I'm from India and in 1980s India, cinema faced a downturn as low-budget B-movies, especially horror films, began outperforming mainstream Bollywood. This trend emerged as the spread of VHS drew wealthier audiences away from theaters, and mainstream films grew stale with repetitive plots. B-horror movies, however, tapped into new audiences—primarily lower-income and blue-collar workers—by incorporating voyeuristic scenes of actresses bathing and changing clothes and their scantily clad bodies, adding a softcore element that made these films popular among rickshaw drivers, laborers, and informal workers. Filmmakers would often use the same location to shoot scenes for 5-6 different movies within a single production period. These movies made a huge profits for their producers made on a budget of just 2000-3000 $.

Sex always has been the best way to market these cheap horror movies which cannot have enough budgets for good prosthetic or CGI effects and that trend has seen a general downturn now a days but in movies of those times, b\*\*bies were just thrown on the audience face time to time to get them invested in the movies.",2024-11-10 07:30:23

Example, (Please don't turn this into a debate about vaccinations.): But when Ice Cube told Tucker Carlson that he voluntarily turned down a $9 million fee for a movie that supposedly required vaccination for filming, but he declined and said ""your health is worth more than all the money in the world"", I personally thought that was bullshit for a number of reasons. Ice Cube would never get a 9 million dollar fee for a low budget comedy. That would be four times what Keanu Reeves received for the third John Wick. Maybe with a producer's fee, but as a producer he could have averted mandatory vaccination. He could have simply worn a mask during filming, like Tom Cruise in “Mission: Impossible”, who didn't get vaccinated but wore a mask all the time, even as the lead actor and producer. So I rather think that there were other production struggles and Cube simply cited this as a reason to present it as a courageous and bold decision that he even gave up millions ""just for his conviction. We all would've taken the huge amount of money, but not him, what a legend"". The fact that he proudly tells Tucker Carlson of all people contributes to this.

Do you have any similar statements from actors/actresses and filmmakers that tickle your “bullshit” radar?

     I was talking to my brother about the puppets and I made a realization. The puppets are represented like this, the puppets are part of the doc’s personality traits; (it’s not in order) 9= Curiosity, 2= Innovation, 7= Bravery, (I’m still trying figure out if 1 or 8 are his guilt but I think one might lean more to his leadership and 8 his guilt)

movies,1gmx7pw,meta reference or what is the actual term is there is a term?,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gmx7pw/meta_reference_or_what_is_the_actual_term_is/,33,"s there a specific term for a movie acknowledging its own production?  
e.g. The Wonder with Florence Pugh showing you the soundstage before the ""movie"" begins, Cinderella (1922) by Lotte Reiniger showing you a character being cut out of paper before the story begins.

i was wondering since it seems a different thing from ""breaking the fourth wall"" since it does not just acknowledge the audience but that the audience is watching something fabricated for them

would also love more examples if you can think of any

or: my dear god - that was exciting! Often, I'm able to move on to the next country on my filmic journey a bit earlier than after 24 hours, but this time: No chance. *Rare Exports* had a thrilling battle with the winner until the very end and I thought I would have to roll the dice, but in the end, the mixture of upvotes and downvotes produced a different winner: ***Mies vailla menneisyyttä*** (engl: *The Man Without a Past*) has narrowly become the most favorite movie set in Finland according to your votes.

I would have liked it for both of them: The runner-up scored with the Christmas theme, the winner seems to have been made by *the* Finnish director. In fact, I haven't seen either of them and maybe both will end up on my watchlist. If I'm completely honest, I haven't watched any of the films that won here yet. Maybe that will change today, because when it comes to your favorite movie set in **France**, I somehow have another one in mind that could win the contest. As everytime, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,1gnrf62,Is Castaway Robert Zemeckis’s last great Movie? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnrf62/is_castaway_robert_zemeckiss_last_great_movie/,38,"Besides Beowulf, which does not count because it’s an animated film, is Castaway the last great movie from Zemeckis?   
After watching the very interesting YouTube video essay from ExtraCheeseProject (https://youtu.be/DBttgC8fspE?si=QBXWsiyi5QUgdu5c), I got really interested in rewatching Castaway and even insofar as renting it online.   
There is a real love for movie making painted on the screen and I think Tom Hanks goes above and beyond to bring this story to life, which proves his Star Power. This is definitely a great movie to start off the early 2000’s of cinema.  
I love the movie was shot on film, which in these days with the over-usage of digital, is our generations “Technicolor”. This movie is very much Hollywood. Gorilla-filmmaking this is not! I can picture a film-crew of 50+ in the background, with air conditioning and a full-on staffed kitchen on that island.   
I love that the movie was temporarily halted so Tom Hanks could loss the weight, and even move love that Zemeckis would take that time to make What Lies Beneath, which in my opinion does not get the love and respect it deserves today. More so, how different both movies are.   
If anything, this movie does feel like 20+ screenwriters all taking a stab at the screenplay, whereas it does not feel like a singular vision, but like a child born of a whorehouse, it’s a son of a hundred fathers.   
I would also say that the time jump does feel a little weak, but this is a Hollywood movie and not some art-house fair that would be regulated to the Criterion Channel.  
If there ever was a remake, I would recommend making something where we see the main character slowly lose his weight, grow his hair out, and become more “stir-crazy”.  But that would be more of a limited series, and would that work?   
Looking at Zemeckis’s current work, I feel there is no love anymore, and is probably fat off the land. This man gave us some of the best American cinema of all time, so I won’t shit on him anymore.   
Anyways is Castaway the last great movie of this filmmaker? Do you believe there is more blood in that stone for greatness, or should be just pat him on the back and say well done? ",2024-11-10 03:21:41

Worse than the excessive padding, reliance on original characters, and poor special-effects, is what the production wrought on the New Zealand film industry. Warner Bros. wanted to move filming to someplace cheap like Romania, while Peter Jackson had the clout to keep it in NZ if he directed the project. The concession was made to simply destroy NZ's film industry by signing in a law that designates production-staff as contractors instead of employees, and with no bargaining power. Since then, elves have not been welcome in Wellington. [The whole affair is best recounted by Lindsay Ellis' excellent video essay.](https://youtu.be/uTRUQ-RKfUs)

[Danny Boyle's The Beach is the worst film ever made. ](https://youtu.be/rMHINpgFO3I)Looking back It's a fascinating time capsule of the late 90's/Y2K era. You've got Moby and All Saints on the soundtrack, internet cafes full of those bubble-shaped Macs before the rebrand, and nobody has a mobile phone. The story is about a backpacker played by Ewan, uh, Leonardo DiCaprio who joins a tribe of westerners that all hang on a cool beach on an uninhabited island off Thailand. It's paradise at first, but eventually reality will come crashing down and the secret of the cool beach will be exposed to the world. Which is what happened in real-life. The production of the film tampered with the real Ko Phi Phi Le beach to make it more paradise-like, prompting a lawsuit that dragged on over a decade. The legacy of the film pushed tourists into visiting the beach, eventually rendering it yet another cesspool until the Thailand authorities closed it in 2018. It's open today, but visits are short and strictly regulated.

Of course, there's also the old favorite that is **The Conqueror**. Casting the white cowboy John Wayne as the Mongolian warlord Genghis Khan was laughed at even in the day. What's less funny is that filming took place downwind from a nuclear test site. 90 crew members developed cancer and half of them died as a result, John Wayne among them. This was of course exacerbated by how smoking was more commonplace at the time.

Our idea is to pick movies that are wildly different in tone, genre or style but when placed next to each other recontexualize each other in interesting ways. The idea came to me last year after watching the new version of ""All's Quiet On The Western Front"" I was feeling a bit heavy after and kind of randomly put on James Gunns ""The Suicide Squad"". It was a movie that I'd seen before and knew I liked and I didn't really think about it, just figured it would like cheer me up or cool me off or whatever but the tonal switch from death at war as dramatic horror to death at war as goofy comedy was actually horrific. The whole first action scene was a completely different shocking experience which I found really interesting. 

So anyways, we've got a few ideas but I would love to hear some other opinions. Obviously one movie playing something for horror and another playing it for comedy is a reliable blueprint but I'm open to any ideas. 

So if you were tasked with picking two very different movies that best recontexualized each other in interesting ways what would you pick? ",2024-11-08 15:03:40

Some of the most influential being RedLetterMedia's Mr. Plinkett's critique of the Star Wars movies.

Naturally, a derivative of critique is rewrites, and after watching a few of them. I feel that rewrites either delve very quickly into their preferred fiction/tone or miss the point of certain scenes

Take Star Wars Ep.1's Jar-Jar Binks, a much derided character of its time and even up till today. Even without liking the character, he's probably the most animated and expressive character of that entire movie, in stark contrast to the rest of the deadpan crew. Rewriting him out would probably need another character to step into his role as the comic relief, in which probably the net effect is just another Jar-Jar.

Another much critiqued scene in the Obi-Wan TV series is the ""lightsaber at belt"" reveal at the end of the pilot episode, critique being that is he stupid to wear his Jedi weapon out in the open.

That shot is meant, not for the in-universe people, but really for the audience, signifying that Obi-Wan is re-entering the fray as a Jedi instead of just another dude.

There are some scenes that are outright preposterous that really deserves a rewrite, such as the trench coat scene from the Fortress Inquisitorious, but by and large, most rewrites only sounds great on-paper and probably would not stand up to service of a larger shoot/story.

(Counts for both movies and series),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gn7ze5/what_is_one_tv_trope_cliché_you_will_never/,41,"I'll start. Something I've noticed a lot in both movies and TV series is that when something traumatic or a serious incident with injuries happen, they often do a two week time jump right after, revealing that everything is fine and no one has any lasting injuries.

Some examples from TV shows 

13 Reasons Why: Clay and Zach get into a car accident. Next shot is them being back at school with Zach on crutches.

Pretty Little Liars: Emily has to fight off a murderer and kills him in self defense. A friend of hers gets shot in the process. Next episode is a two week time jump with everyone being fine.

  
This completely undermines the drama and excitement. It always makes me wonder why they include it in the first place if you're not going to focus on these characters getting better or dealing with what happened. It ruins the moment and creates no stakes if a time jump can brush it all away.

The only time I can excuse it if it's meant as a traumatic backstory to flesh out a character rather than something happening in the present time. For example, the opening of Godzilla (2014).

I liked it but it didn’t linger enough. I decided to rewatch it… wow! Now it did. Maybe I just needed to be older but gosh the whole atmosphere just oozes tension. Every scene feels like a pin dropping. I didn’t go to a catholic school but if that’s what it’s like I feel bad for anyone that did. 

The cast is brilliant! Meryl Streep’s character of course starts out as the stern disciplinarian. But by the end you see she’s just as afraid and unsure as anyone. Philip Seymour Hoffman character? I had no idea if he did it or not. I want to believe he didn’t and he really convinces me. But at the same time I know there’s just no way to be sure. I honestly forgot what a versatile actor he is. Amy Adam’s plays someone really out of her depth but you feel for her. She’s really trying. And Viola Davis conveys such quiet desperation and trauma you can feel the pain coming off of her. Her whole scene speaks volumes of the horror she’s potentially witnessing or aware of, but she can’t scream or acknowledge any of it. What a hopeless situation.

Nothing big really happens. There’s no fist fight, explosion, murder, not even a true resolution. But it feels so real because that’s usually how life is. I guess it doesn’t matter if he did it or not. The point is there’s so much in life you can’t be sure of. And it’s hard on everybody. I watched it last week but still can’t stop thinking about it. I haven’t seen a film in a while that’s made me do that.

movies,1gneo67,Do movie buff competitions exist? They should. Here's why.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gneo67/do_movie_buff_competitions_exist_they_should/,25,"With just a single second of turning on the television, I could effortlessly identify the movie on my screen as Spy Kids 2. No actors on screen, no clear-cut clues—just the faintest hint of the director’s style and soundtrack, and I knew. Instantly. They should make a competition for people with movie knowledge as sharp as mine, but honestly, who could even compete? I’d clear the floor in seconds. I mean, who else could decipher a film purely from the subtlest atmospheric choices, like I have some kind of sixth cinematic sense? They should honestly make me an honorary advisor in Hollywood—maybe a ""Cinematic Genius in Residence."" Imagine the artistry Scorsese or Tarantino could reach under my guidance; they could learn a thing or two, no question. People always talk about having a ""golden ear"" for music, but I've developed something even rarer—a ""golden eye"" for cinema.

You could blindfold me, spin me around in a room full of obscure indie films, and within seconds, I’d know exactly what I was dealing with. Play me five seconds of ambient sound, and I'd tell you it’s Solaris—the 1972 Tarkovsky version, obviously—not just from the music, but from the space between the sounds, the tension only he could create. Or throw on a random frame from a lesser-known French New Wave film—say, Le Samouraï—and without even seeing the lead actor’s face, I’d recognize Melville’s shadowy, deliberate style. It’s intuitive, like breathing.

Take Troll 2, that so-bad-it’s-good cult classic that most would dismiss as just camp. But within a split second of that cheesy opening scene, I’d know exactly what I was watching. It’s not just about recognizing the film, it’s about understanding the essence of it, the ambition buried beneath its flaws. Blindfold me, plug my ears, and I’d still pick up on the vibrations of the scene.

It’s almost tragic, really. Imagine the films that could’ve been masterpieces had they passed through my hands first. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone else even sees what I see, or if I'm simply existing on a higher plane of cinematic understanding, alone. Directors today would do well to consult me before releasing their work. Imagine the power of a film that’s been refined under my gaze. I could tell them which shots resonate, which moments miss the mark—before the critics even have a chance to complain.

Hollywood is lucky I haven’t swooped in and redefined the industry. Sometimes, when I watch a film, I can feel myself critiquing it on levels the average viewer couldn’t even fathom. The framing, the score, the pacing—all of it would reach new heights if filtered through my vision. My ability to discern artistry isn’t something you can learn. It’s inherent, genetic, probably; I’m practically an oracle of cinema, capable of unraveling layers that others would need entire lifetimes to perceive.

I’ve sometimes thought about doing this as a public demonstration, you know? Just to give people a glimpse of what it’s like to witness true brilliance in action. But really, would the world even appreciate it? Most people just don’t have the capacity to grasp the layers I see. And frankly, that's all right. True genius is always overlooked by the masses.

In contrast, Jason Blum has mentioned that his approach involves making the film itself affordable while spending around $30 million on marketing. How is Terrifier 3 managing to achieve such success with so little financial backing? It's truly baffling.

""The Substance"" is a dystopian, almost cyberpunk-esque film that commentates on aging, body dysmorphia, and self-hatred. While its themes are very relevant in today's society, I believe that the way which Fargeat (the writer & director) handled said themes was, perhaps, too obvious in its execution. With little to no nuance at all, ""The Substance"" stands as a film which focuses too much on in-the-face (literally) partial nudity and grotesque body horror. At what point does showing a close-up of Margaret Qualley's ass in a pink leotard become gratuitous? Additionally, this film handles allusions with a seeming idea that the audience is moronic. To place a badly done flashback of another scene when we are supposed to remember it at this new moment feels like an insult from the director.

Furthermore, ""The Substance"" feels like a film centered around shock factor, especially at the end. The revelation of the Russian Roulette of Elisabeth's could have been executed well if not for the over-the-top blood bath done for no real reason. Additionally, the nudity in this scene (i.e. throwing up a whole boob, wtf??) is unnecessary and feels like another ploy to add as many nipples in one film as you can. Not to mention the dancer's being nude, as well. On Live T.V.? In general, I can see the appeal to this movie but I believe that it is nothing more than a surface-level, attention-grabber film that has little ""substance,"" if you will, than that.",2024-11-09 06:51:44
