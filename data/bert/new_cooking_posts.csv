I recently went to a farmer's market that I haven't been to since last year. There's one seller there where I used to be obsessed with their yellow tomatoes every August and September. The last time I went, I asked how long they would have tomatoes for, and they said, ""Actually, November because we grow them in a hot house."" I always loved their yellow tomatoes specifically because they were a bit more mellow, less acidic, and slightly sweeter. I stopped by recently to try to catch them before they're gone, and while they still tasted nice, they were a lot more sour than I remember them being.

I don't know if they keep their tomato plants in a hot house even in the summer, but if not, is this because they were grown in a hot house? Could it be that there is a taste difference between peak season and late season or tomatoes that mature in ""colder"" weather?

Is there any way to transform this into a very gravy? Should I make a new roux with butter & add my gravy to it? Should I add beef stock cubes to it? Or do I just make my peace with  what I’ve done & find a way to eat it?

I want to smoke a turkey for Thanksgiving but I'm quite unsure if my oven recipe will be too much for the meat in the smoker. I really wanted to ask for any advice anyone could share with me, I'm just an amateur cook.

I inject 36 hours prior to cooking, dry brine  24 hours before, then the turkey goes into the oven and I glaze it gradually with a tray beneath it for my gravy fat after the turkey is done.

My plan for smoking was:  
Inject 36 hours prior, dry brine with salt and sugar 24 hrs prior (3:1 ratio is what I've found to be the norm online) then make a composite butter with herbs and garlic confit and put that inside the skin covering the breast.

Cook and glaze in a sauce made with maple syrup, sherry vinegar, worcestershire, dark soy, orange peel, herbs garlic and butter (as per the notorious foodie recipe) in the smoker rotating every hour so as to crisp up the skin properly until the breast is done cooking then rest 30 mins.

Is the composite butter and injection of the meat overkill? Will it make it mush? Or is it sound reasoning and worthwhile for the flavor?

But it is locked.  Since Aldi has lamb breast and lamb breast today I thought I post a couple more ideas - What is your favorite version?

\#1. Lebanese stuffed cooked rice and spices and/or ground meat between the fat and the meat.  It helps absorb the fat and makes the dish taste less fatty although still very rich. Here is one sample recipe. There are many variant recipes from the Middle East. This is my second best favorite.

[https://www.cheftariq.com/recipe/lamb-breast/#recipe](https://www.cheftariq.com/recipe/lamb-breast/#recipe)

\#2 Italians make a more rich stuffed version with bread/eggs/cheese but smother it at the end with lots of tomato sauce which cuts down the fatty taste.  in Italian.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Knce6ye8kw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Knce6ye8kw0)

\#3. My favorite recipe though is lamb pancetta.  It is also a great way to preserve the lamb breast until the next time Aldi sells it - although many Walmarts now sell lamb breast regularly.

This recipe is a fool proof and easy recipe that I use- in Italian but self explanatory.

\#5. Nice stew version from Jacques Peppin.  First defats the breast by frying then cooks. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiRyvR2-Lpc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiRyvR2-Lpc)

And a nice short video on how to debone the breast plate.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VAgEGiOyiI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VAgEGiOyiI)

Butternut Squash Soup  



* 1 butternut squash (3.75-4 lbs before peeling and coring), peeled, cored, and cubed in 1-inch pieces
* 1 lg carrot, cubed in 1-inch pieces
* 1 lg granny smith apple, cubed in 1-inch pieces
* 2 inches of ginger root, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 medium-large onion (yellow recommended), peeled and quartered with the root cut off.
* approximately 6 cups high-quality vegetable stock
* About 1/2 head's worth of roast garlic (pre-roasted, or 4-6 cloves peeled and added to the vegetable tray)
* 1 sprig fresh sage
* 1/2 tsp dry thyme
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* a pinch of fresh-ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
* 1- tsp soy sauce
* 1-2 tsp balsamic reduction
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 4 tablespoons of butter for finishing.

First I roasted the garlic via the ""Decapitate, drizzle with oil, wrap in foil, roast"" method.  Then I roasted the other vegetables and apple at 425, tossing occasionally, until browned and mostly softened (About 1 1/2 hours for me)

I added all the ingredients to the soup pot, covered with just enough stock to cover, and simmered until fully softened (which took some time - I should have cut the carrots smaller), then removed the sage and immersion blended until smooth. I adjusted the texture with more stock and seasoned to taste, then stirred in the butter off the heat.

I garnished with crisped bacon bits, pepitas, and goat cheese.  Wound up darn tasty!",2024-11-13 03:12:19

Normally, I’m aware that we bloom gelatin in cold water for 5-10 minutes, before adding it to the recipe.

However, I’ve got hold of some powdered gelatin packets. The package instructions state that the gelatin powder can be sprinkled directly to the very hot liquid, and mixed thoroughly. They didn’t mention the gelatin blooming process. I did as they instructed, and my watermelon jello came out good ! There were no gelatin clumps or a weird texture. I simply added 2 powder gelatin packets to the very hot watermelon juice, mixed it  thoroughly, and placed in the fridge to set. 

Another gelatin packet that I bought instructs for the gelatin to be bloomed before adding to the mixture.

My questions: 

1. Is blooming gelatin all that important? 

2. Is there a science behind it (like, yeast)? 

3. If my jello comes out fine even if I don’t bloom the gelatin in cold water beforehand, can I go ahead with this ?

There are so many replies that I can't reply to them all, but this has been so helpful already. I've gotten a lot of really functional replies so far, thank you everyone.



Maybe this question is better suited for a different subreddit, but I'm kind of at my wits ends.



I just don't know how to stock my pantry and cupboards to pivot from what I've made, but it keeps happening that I make some really nice homemade meal and my wife texturally just cannot do it that day. Doesn't matter if it's rice, pasta, cheese, eggs, crunchy greens, cooked soft greens, high or low salt, high or low spice, meat or no meat, etc... I'll make homemade onion jam, marmalades, focaccia, pasta sauce, everything.



And when that happens she just can't even smell or bite into the food I have made, I usually just give up and get her a pizza or burgers or Thai food or sushi or whatever BOGO is available that day. 



I'm not trying to make her want to eat what I make, I'm trying to reconfigure my cooking to be more adjustable. It feels like I'm doing everything right by always asking what she wants, and confirming if she imagines eating it will that texture be okay. But so often she just comes home and says the smell or rice or barley or pasta is gross that day and she won't eat it or basically anything here. So I know I'm doing something really wrong.



I understand she's not trying to do this, and I just want to make her home cooked food instead of ordering out everytime she doesn't like what I've made. But I can't figure out what to do when I need to stock our pantry and kitchen with a variety of different things for every part of a meal from carbs, to protein, to fats, to dessert, and I know in advance that there's a good chance nothing I do will work. Like I can't afford stocking our house like it's a supermarket.



I specifically want to cook more things that my wife will eat, but I am running into a wall where if I prepare too much in advance it doesn't work, and we just aren't stocking in advance in the ways that are texturally available to her all the time. So we often end up where her dinners don't have acceptable carbs, or vegetables, or protein, so we just have to order.



Maybe some people here have picky partners or kids and they've figured out how to attend to this? I'm just really having trouble navigating how one day my wife wants to eat Brussel sprouts, and one day later she tells me that she can't come home until I air out the smell of brussel sprouts out of the house, and then I have to basically redo all of dinner because I have no veggies and she won't even touch the protein because it was cooked near Brussel sprouts and she's uncomfortable eating them.",2024-11-11 19:04:02

I tried to make a turkey demiglace and it didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Was wondering if you would have any suggestions, or if you could tell me if it is salvagabe.

I roasted the bones/residual mean from a deboned turkey carcass until the meat was well browned. I then took all of the juices, bones, and a good amount of veggies and slow cooked it for about 14 hours w/ turkey stock and water just covering the bones. At the end, the bones were brittle and no cartilage was left.

I removed all of the solids and rapidly cooled the fluid, then put it in the fridge overnight. I even cheated and added a packet of gelatin. The next morning the stock was only partially gelled., not enough to cut or hold its shape. I removed as much fat from the top as possible.

Tonight I'm planning on reducing the stock until maybe 1/3 of the volume is cooked off. I'm hoping that the boiling/simmering is enough to activate the gelatin so that when I put it back in the fridge, it will gel appropriately.

Can you all see anything that if glaringly obvious that I might have done wrong? Aside from not boiling/reducing earlier in the process? Is it salvageable at this point?

Appetizers: Potato latkes, snack board with crackers, veggies, cheese hummus, nuts, fruit

Mains: Hearty vegan lentil stew VS maple glazed tofu

Festive salmon VS brined/smoked chicken

Sides ideas: crispy brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, quinoa-stuffed acorn squash, festive salad of some kind, dinner rolls?

So i was given a ton of potatoes, onion, and carrots. Oh and adozen bags of grapes. I'm low on funds and groceries at the moment, so if really like to prep meals or just bags of veggies to freeze. I have a chest freezer.  Just have a few questions. 

With the potatoes, I know to parboil them, let them freeze up on a cooking sheet with parchment, then bag em in portions.  Any ideas (besides a beef veggie soup that I'm making tonight) that I could use to meal prep that will freeze well? 

Also, no idea how to store 12 pounds of carrots. I did see a post from the other math book lady about them so I'll go skim that again since it inspired me, but was also a forewarning! 

Can I freeze grapes without them changing their texture or loading their quality? For how long if say, vacuum sealed? 

Thank you to everyone who reads and responds, I'll throw pictures in the comments so you know I'm not a troll lol. 

UPDATE: I appreciate all of the advice and great recipes and links. I've decided to store the taters in a large cupboard out in my back room where it's not heated.  I'm going to slice, dice, and portion the onions and freeze them after a good French onion soup and in with some frozen hash browns.  As for the carrots, I'm going to do a soup after I get some squashes, then boil and puree the rest, freezing in portions. Frozen grapes sound awesome, why have I never thought to do this?!

To start off, instead of using peanut oil, we are using bacon grease, from the company bacon up. We have a friend that is allergic to peanuts, so we decided we would try bacon grease. 
However the one thing I’m struggling with is trying to find out how much bacon grease to use. I’ve watched baking ups on video on YouTube, and it does not make a clear indication of how much to use. 
I know you can put the turkey in the pot, fill it with water then take it out and mark it. Cool, great. However the bacon up grease is not a liquid like peanut oil. To me, it makes sense but at the same time doesn’t because it’s not a liquid. 
Am I over thinking that?
Secondly, we are going to host our friends Thanksgiving this Saturday (11/17/2024) and I already have both turkeys thawing out in the fridge. I am deadly afraid of having any water on those turkeys. I was going to inject them on Saturday. And put them back in the fridge. Is there anything you guys may do to help get the water out or off of the turkeys besides padding them with a paper towel?

I have been using hand-me-down and ""cheap"" cookware sets for my adult life.  I want to finally get myself a nice pan (not a cookware set) that I can learn to cook better with.  I currently have a T-fal 12 inch fry pan (amazon link below).  I want to get a nice pan from All-Clad as that seems to be a very good reliable brand from the general consensus and what I have found on reddit.  I just need help with deciding what type of pan and size I should get.

I am pretty sure that the D3 Stainless Everyday should be suitable for me, based on what I have read.  My only real question is, which type of pan should I purchase for my general cooking?  I don't know what type of pan to choose between sauce, ragu, essential, fry, skillet etc.  I've been searching and reading a lot of stuff online, but I am kind of getting to that point where I am overwhelmed and don't have enough basic knowledge to really make an informed decision.

I do most of my cooking in the T-fal 12 inch fry pan, largely because it is the biggest and probably best pan that I have.  I have other pots and pans from a ""cheap"" cookware set that I got years ago.  Unless I need more than one pan, I stick with the T-fal fry pan.  I am very much an amateur cook that doesn't do anything outside of pretty standard cooking.  I will make scrambled eggs, stir-fry, hamburgers (when I'm too lazy to grill) and just other standard recipes (I can expand more on recipes and what I cook if needed).  I think what I am looking for is a large stainless steel pan that is similar to the function and at least as big in size of the T-fal fry pan.  But I am fairly ignorant in this area, so a fry pan might not be the best option for what I am looking for.

What type and size of pan would you recommend from All-Clad?  Is a fry pan the best style of pan for what I am looking to use it for or should I get a different style that would work better?  I like the 12 inch size, but sometimes wish I had a little more space to cook with.  I'm pretty sure that I will go with the D3 Stainless Everyday, unless there is a significant reason to choose another option.

I'm sorry if this isn't very clear or concise, I did my best to provide information and explain what guidance I need.  I can clarify or provide any further information that might be needed.

I subscribed to a meal kit food delivery service, but ended up being sent _way_ more food than I could possibly cook and eat by myself each week. So until I paused the subscription more and more of the raw food (including potatoes, cloves of garlic, onions, and other spices and condiments) was being stockpiled in the fridge's (mainly in the crisper section), and the (shrink-wrapped) raw meat (including chicken cutlets, ground beef, ground pork, etc.) was put straight in the freezer.

Nine or ten months later, all of the meat in the freezer is frozen solid. Every so often I thaw out of one of the packets and cook it, and they've been fine. So at this point I'm not afraid of the meat having gone bad in the interim. The potatoes look OK although some of them are getting shriveled and a few have dark patches on them. Most of the bulbs of garlic are rock-hard, some of them are firm but still pliable, but some of those bulbs and nearly all of the onions have long fresh green leaves sprouting out of them. 

My question is: how can I know for sure when to throw out potatoes, garlic, and onions that have been stored for months in the fridge like that? When it is safe to still eat them, and when should I immediately dispose of them?

I never could afford implants.
So I can not eat tough meat. Chewing tough meat with nothing but my remaining molars is painful. So I usually buy really good steak. $22/lb good. Well that same steak is now $32+/lb. A bit of a high price for my part time pay check.

cooking,1gpru3n,Seeking Advice - Recreating My Grandma's Baby Burritos,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gpru3n/seeking_advice_recreating_my_grandmas_baby/,8,"Hello r/Cooking!

I'm seeking help regarding my attempted recreation of my Grandma's baby burritos. Now, for clarification, these baby burritos weren't actually burritos. My grandmother would make a mixture of scrambled eggs, diced hash browns, and tiny pieces of bacon. Then she would set them on a plate with two browned tortillas, and we would tear them apart and use the pieces to pick up the mixture, eating them with our hands. They were my favorite breakfast, but she's gone now, and I want to recreate them.

For the recipe, I'm using three large eggs, 2 1/2 cups of potatoes, and eight slices of bacon. I use 1-2 tbsp of butter each to cook the eggs and the potatoes, and some leftover bacon grease to cook the meat.

I have three main problems. 

1. My Grandma was both Hispanic and ex-military, and as a result, she was extremely secretive about her family recipes. She told me that she refused to send me her polveron recipe over text because, and I quote, ""The government will steal it."" So, I have no idea how to make these the way she used to, and I'm eyeballing the recipe. 

2. I can't get the scrambled eggs to be the exact texture and taste that she made. All the scrambled egg recipes I find online are so creamy and yellow. Hers were perfect; they would come out of her cast iron pan much drier but not too dry. They looked white and yellow and formed into tiny chunks that mixed well with the potatoes and bacon. When I try to make them, they don't split apart the right way or hold the same color or texture. I'm still a beginner, but I know how to cook eggs well enough. I just have no clue what I'm doing wrong.

3. Mixing the eggs with the diced browns and bacon is proving to be fairly difficult. I think I'm having trouble getting the timing right for when to add the potatoes and bacon bits to the eggs so they all finish cooking together. Maybe I should cook them all separately throughout the entire process? But then I'm not sure if they'd mix correctly.

I apologize if these seem like fairly easy issues to solve, or if I'm doing something really wrong that I haven't recognized. I just really want to make these as perfect as I can, but I just can't do it the way she used to. If anyone could provide some advice or maybe identify any issues that I haven't, please let me know. It would mean so, so much to me. Thank you!",2024-11-12 18:36:18

Air fryer turkey wings (prepared like chicken wings) (I will butcher the bird before baking and separate out the cuts)

They still can get quite big, with 20 or 30 people, but this year it'll be our smallest one yet, with ""just"" 15 guests.

The past few years, the food hasn't been quite working out. When everyone brought a dish, there was quite a lof of confusion in the kitchen when it was time to get everything to serve. Last year, when I wasn't there, they hired a catering service but didn't like it.

So, this year, I volunteered to take over kitchen duties entirely. I love cooking and, honestly, I'm kinda glad to have an excuse to stay in the kitchen doing my own thing for most of the day. The thing is, I need to have all the staples: we gotta have a turkey (which I've already been making for a few years now), we gotta have gammon, we gotta have a pasta-based dish, we need to have rice and farofa (we're Brazilian, it's a side dish made with manioca flour), we need to have a salad.

I already have everything planned out (except for the salad, still working on this one), but I'm not sure how to plan for quantities.

They are saying that my pan is the common denominator in breaking 2 previous induction cooking surfaces, but I believe (from what I've read online) that a pan cannot break an induction furnace electrically other than cracking or scratching the surface glass.

After the 2 cooking surfaces they provided both seemed to have killed themselves, I bought an ikea portable induction hob that I used on low power mode for 4 hours with the simmer pan. Now when I tried to use it yesterday it tripped the circuit breaker when trying to boil some water in the same 7-ply simmer pan (Max power). And now every socket I plug the induction cooktop into will trip the circuit breaker even when I put it on 1 power. So they asked me to go to Ikea, get a new induction hob and try again with one of their pans. 

They say that the cooktop has worked fine for a year with their provided pans (some shitty single ply stainless steel pot), so it must be my pan that is the problem according to them.

I think it's somewhere in the circuit and they should have an electrician investigate the problem in the circuit, but I'm not an electrician so I'm just going off what I'm reading online, which is that no induction furnace has ever killed itself just by using a certain type of pan",2024-11-12 08:53:06

We have an ambitious goal of making our own bone broth. You might ask, ""what's so ambitious about that?"" We bought a 40 qt pot to make a large batch of it at least once a year for ourselves, friends, and families. We could do it in smaller pots but we find it more worthwhile to do it in larger batches. Our mentality is similar to most when it comes to lasagna, cabbage rolls, etc. It's a lot of work to make one serving. So if we're going to do it, we might as well scale up and make multiple servings at a time and freeze the extras.

Back to the broth. We can do it inside on our gas stove but we prefer to do it outside for a few reasons: 

1. It's a low and slow kind of process (8 hours+) so we don't want to occupy the stove;
2. Given the length of time, we also prefer not to smell it throughout the house for the same amount of time (if not longer). Just a bit of extra context here... We don't enjoy the *lingering* smell of cooking. Ideally, if we could snap our fingers for the house to smell like fresh laundry after eating, we would.
3. Increase in house temperature;
4. Young children. Our children know not to touch the stove but we'd like the extra precaution (of doing it outside) given the extended amount of time the stove will be on.

We have a natural gas hook-up outside for our BBQ. I've tried to look for an outdoor burner using NG, but most of the units have to be sourced from the US (we're from Canada). The home-brew community 

Induction heater was a suggestion I saw on Reddit as the most economic. However, my concern is the weight restriction. 40qt stainless steel pot + the liquid + bones = approx. 110 lb. The max capacity I could [find on Amazon was 100 lb](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07FZTVSV9?ref=emc_p_m_5_i_atc)

Propane was another suggestion I saw on Reddit. Some had concerns that it'd be too expensive and a 20 lb tank would not be enough.

  
What do y'all suggest?

I’ve been making my family dinner solo since I was 13, so I’ve gotten pretty comfortable having full control over the kitchen and dinner.

I have this friend who goes to a local technical school and does their culinary program (it’s not a very good program, but said friend enjoys it). When my friend comes over and it’s time for me to make dinner for everyone said friend insists on helping. However, their cooking is NOT to my standards. When I ask them to cut and peel carrots, there will be strips of skin left all over it. Not big strips, but enough that it drives me insane. If friend cuts potatoes for fries they’ll cut huge chunks that do not cook well enough for fries. The first time I let them cook with me they didn’t even know that the white part of scallions is great for eating; they literally threw them away! I could go on, but my main point is that it’s not up to my admittedly high standards and it drives me crazy. That’s not even mentioning how my friend will try to give me advice on “proper technique”. Like bro, I don’t care about technique as much as results. I don’t care if only touching the handle is the incorrect way of holding a knife, I have a bigger problem with you cutting giant squares of onion instead of mincing it.

It’s not that big of a deal, but it drives me absolutely insane. 


Edit: I’m getting a lot of comments giving me good advice, specifically in extending more grace towards my friend. You’re right in that my friend is just trying to enjoy doing an activity with me. My only thing is that my friend tends to stay full weekends with me where we’re doing everything together all day, so cooking is one of my few chances to get a break and be alone for a minute. I guess that’s where most of the frustration comes from regarding sharing a kitchen, though our different experience levels probably don’t make it easier, lol. I want to thank everyone for sharing their thoughts and feelings!

Weed/Fortified Rice/Potion Making,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gponas/could_drugs_be_used_when_cooking_dishes_for/,2,"I was thinking about anime and manga where a character eats the food and they receive buffs and healing effects to an extent. This got me thinking about ways to make food more healing and preventing chronic diseases. I have been interested in this because of my IBD UC that made my colon not like fiber to a certain extent. After experimenting with fermented foods that I would then juice it helped me to eat more fiber, and I also realized the different types and my preferred ratios of dietary fiber. What system I was contemplating of cultivating would be a system that incorporates medical-esque factors to provide more overall healing and prevention. A omnivore diet that takes the best out of every food group and also provides tonics/potions for boosted culinary medicine. The first thing I started to combine is the Rainbow from the vegan diet and the Carnivore Nose-To-Tail approach together to have a well rounded base. Nose-To-Tail being for the small intestines and body, and the Plant Rainbow being for the gut-brain connection and large intestines. I also got the inspiration from certain activities already done to mix food and medicine; for example, drug tablets that are put in water, edibles (food with weed as an ingredient), red wine vinegar (alcohol incorporation as ingredient), and fortified rice and breads. The reluctance I have with this untested approach is the dilemma of natural vs. synthetic substances, and with food being natural and already good enough in a way for survival. Sayings like ""every disease starts in the gut"" or ""food is medicine"" have a synergy but also a conflict with each other where medicine can't be eaten and disease will infiltrate into every crevice.

I should preface this by saying my family only served turkey twice a year and we had so much of it during that time that I grew to loathe it. 

I've had it wet brined, I've had it dry brined, I've had it spatchcocked, I've had it whole, I've had it stuffed, I've had it unstuffed, I've had it roasted, I've had it deep fried, I've had it baked, I've had it sous vide, I've had it barbequed, I've had the expensive turkey, I've had the cheap supermarket turkey...literally every single freaking way imaginable.

So when I moved out and started hosting my own Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, I banned turkeys and have an alternative protein such as standing rib, capon, duck, beef Wellington and one time goose. My family were perfectly happy with it because they didn't have to cook other than the obligatory sides and beverages.

This year, my friend's family invited me over for Thanksgiving and asked me to help cook. This is fine by me because I love to cook and they have agreed to purchase the ingredients. The catch is that they want to do turkey this year. I'm also bringing roast beef this year (I'm buying and cooking it) so at least I can have something and we have a backup in case something goes wrong.

Now I can't stand the stuff but I still want to make a nice turkey because they're my friends and, well, they are buying the ingredients.

I am planning on spatchcocking the bird and using a dry brine. I'm also planning on roasting it to 155F and letting carryover do the rest along with at least a half an hour rest between it coming out and carving time. I'm planning on doing a trial run with a small bird before I actually cook it so I'm not flying blind on T-Day.

Is there other things I can do to ensure the turkey is at least nice for my friends who love turkey?",2024-11-11 20:55:15

I mise en place, focus on form over speed, and preheat everything to ensure when I start I don’t need to do too many unnecessary things. 

Of course I’m not perfect, I still forget things and such, but making meals will still take me a couple hours, and the dishes will take me another couple hours later that night, but I feel like I’m a lot better than I used to be. But I always hear about the professionals taking 1 hr active time to cook what it takes me 2 hrs active time and I can’t imagine it’s just their knife skills being better, but I can’t figure out what it is.

What are some skills y’all developed that really helped your process flow, and what are some common mistakes that you don’t think are talked about enough that I or others may still be making?

Edit: a lot of people are bamboozled by the time it takes to do dishes, those are not one meals dishes, it’s multiple people adding dishes to the pile over a whole day, and at the end of the day I clean them all. One meals dishes take anywhere from 5-15 on their own, but unloading dishwasher, loading it, doing all dishes from whatever other people cooked, and then whatever I cooked can take anywhere from 1-2 hrs. Some nights it is too much and I just don’t get it done, which then also adds more onto the next day, hence how it can take so long. There is always at least one reset every week where I power through and get everything done regardless of how much there is though.",2024-11-10 17:05:36

Hi it is my first time contributing to the thanksgiving get together this year and I was assigned sweet potato casserole. I bought a nice glass casserole dish with a plastic lid and an insulated casserole carrier and found a delicious recipe. My concern is how to keep it warm in the carrier without the lid creating too much condensation and make the marshmallow topping all wet? And also how long should I let it cool before covering it so that it stays warm but doesn't get too melty? The gathering is about 30 minutes away and then we expect another few minutes of chatting and waiting for everyone to arrive before we eat. It is being held somewhere that does not have a kitchen so baking it when I arrive is not an option. I am a very new cook and this is my first year contributing to the thanksgiving meal and I don't want to ruin the casserole or make the marshmallow wet and soggy because a lot of people are looking forward to it! A friend also suggested that I just cover it with foil and skip the carrier all together as to not keep it too warm for too long to where the marshmallow melts down too much so would that be better? Any advice welcome like I said I'm basically brand new at this cooking thing so I have no idea what I'm doing. Thanks in advance y'all !!",2024-11-12 04:43:21

What rice variety would you say is the most versatile? My kitchen has pretty limited storage, so I only have room for one large rice container. Therefore, I'd like to know what you guys think the best variety to buy that will cover the widest recipe range. So rice that's good for stir-fries, basic side dish to accompany a main (ie. chicken and rice), baked rice dish, pilafs, etc...I'm leaving out risotto and Japanese rice dishes since I know those require specialty rices.


I currently use the generic enriched long-grain rice (the kind you get store-brand for like $1.50 a pound), but I find that it doesn't reheat well. Since I would like to use this rice for work lunches, a variety that doesn't get as crunchy and dry on microwaving would be a bonus. And yes, I do sprinkle water on it before microwaving, but this rice still comes out dry.

While adding buckwheat honey to tea, I realized I never came across any materials regarding pairing specific types of honey with anything to utilize the unique taste qualities of the product. 

For example, heather honey has this waxy note, as if you're chewing on the honeycomb—a very nostalgic taste for me, and I definitely would utilize heather honey while making honeycomb/cinder toffee to play on the, well, word-taste play, I guess. On the other hand, buckwheat honey is rich, very different from other honeys, almost earthy. I think it would make an interesting glaze for meat due to its richness that goes beyond plain floral sweetness. But also it might be hella interesting in a bee's knees, earthiness and sweetness cut by lemon while flirting with the herbiness of the chosen gin.

What are other good honey pairings that do not come down to generic honey pairings like ""honey pairs with cheese""? Do you know any sources or authors that explore the topic?

I get those little round ones (from walmart, if anyone has seen them) and I cut them into eighths, so they’re pretty small. i’m sure that makes a difference, too. they’re mixed in olive oil, garlic, and various spices, if that would make a difference. any ideas on temp/time modifications appreciated! :) ",2024-11-11 23:09:51

3-4 pounds ground beef 73/27 or 80/20

1 pound bacon

8 oz beef liver or liver pate

2-3 grated carrots

2 medium onions diced or 1 shrek size onion

4-5 celery sticks diced

4-5 garlic cloves diced

1 cup or bunch chopped fresh dill 

1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 

1 cup mushrooms rough chopped

1/2 cup bread crumbs

1/2 cup flour 

2 tsp crushed peppercorns 

About 1 cup water or broth 

An unknown amount of salt

1-2 heads of cabbage

2, 35 oz cans cento canned tomatoes or crushed tomatoes

Sour cream as much as you want

Blanch your cabbage heads enough for you to peel the leaves easily then take them out of the water and set aside

Drain the water from the pot

Rough slice your bacon into 1-2 inch slices, fry it in that pot till crispy and set aside. 

Dump in your veggies in the same pot you cooked your bacon in and let it fry and deglaze the pot at the same time. 

When fried take the veggies out, don’t mind if you leave a little bit inside if you can’t take it all out. You don’t have to be precise. 

Dump in your canned tomatoes or crushed tomatoes and turn the heat to low, add about a tsp of salt and mix that quickly. 

In a big bowl mix all your meat, veggies, herbs, you can leave aside some crispy bacon and dill as a topping on your sour cream for later. 

Guesstimate the amount of salt you need because I don’t know myself. 

Go in with 1/2 the amount of flour and mix it in first.
Then add the breadcrumbs. The mixture will start to get thick. You want to add 1/2 your water or broth at this point. 

If your mixture looks pretty good without being too pasty or watery then stop here and roll your cabbage rolls, cook it in the tomato sauce on low for about an hour. Add like 2-4 cups of broth or water to that tomato sauce so it doesn’t dry out. 

When your rolls are done eat it with a dallop of sour cream, garnished with chopped dill and fried crispy bacon pieces. It is so yummy. 

I was inspired by Helen Rennie’s video for making Pelmeni. I altered the recipe a little bit to make softer meatballs, but skip the video to the filling part to see what your mixture should look like because the flour and bread softens your meat but you don’t want a pate or pasty texture. That means it’s too much flour. In her video the texture of her pelmeni filling is what you want your meat filling to look like. 

I’m sorry I don’t have super precise measurements but I’ve been cooking for a while so most of the time I just guesstimate the amount of stuff to add. 

If you want to stretch out your budget then add 1 cup of cooked rice to the meat filling and 1/2 the amount of flour. 

This’ll easily make a huge pot or 1-2 huge casseroles full of cabbage rolls that you can portion out and freeze them. 

You can make 20 colossal rolls or 40 medium size ones, especially if you decide to add rice to stretch out your money. 

One cabbage roll for me is about a palm full so depending on how much you eat, 1-2 can be a full meal. ",2024-11-11 21:49:45

* Small turkey and gravy
* Scalloped potatoes
* Cranberry sauce (from a can, the way my family prefers it)

* Devilled eggs
* Sausage stuffed acorn squash
* Sweet potato casserole
* Corn casserole

* Breadrolls (frozen and reheated)
* Desserts

Turned heat to high for one hour, tasted, and added two beef bullion cubes; one small can of tomato paste; small white onion, diced small; and a couple of finely chopped garlic cloves.

Note that, except for the turkey leg, this is the first that any salt or acid has been introduced.

Left on high heat for another hour, removed turkey leg, shredded and chopped meat, added meat back to beans. Broth tasted great, had decent body to it.

But when I sampled a couple beans, they were only soft about 1/3 of the way through. Still crunchy inside.

I've made this basic dish many times and this is the first the beans didn't turn out nice and creamy. Any ideas what went wrong?",2024-11-11 19:34:39
cooking,1gp0uu2,Help! Advice on starting a art/illustration cookbook ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gp0uu2/help_advice_on_starting_a_artillustration_cookbook/,2,"Hi there! I am passionate about cooking and illustration. I had an idea where I wanted to illustrate food in my own style but include my favorite recipes from various people and recipe developers. I however do not want to steal work from people. My goal is more about art/illustration and the joy of cooking. I thought I could just do the art alone but I felt that I would get people hungry and want to cook it. I also would like to give credit to chiefs and developers s that got me excited about food and cooking to where I love making it and drawing it. I do make my own recipes too but most of the time that is me using something that already exists and doing my own spin. It would also be a lot of extra work to test every new recipe and I usually eyeball my cooking or follow a recipe. 

Anyone have experience writing cook books?
I know for a fact this comes up all the time of who owns a recipe like when do you call a chocolate chip cookie your own? 
Any background/advice or thoughts are very much appreciated!

Most recipes online suggest a water-curing step (soak olives in fresh water, changed daily) followed by a salt-brining step (soak olives in salty water, changed weekly).

ChatGPT said that – if I had to – skipping the water-curing step would be totally acceptable, and that some people even prefer it that way. Claude is more skeptical, and says without water-curing, the olives won't taste good.

Can’t get baked chicken breast texture right ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1goudox/help_cant_get_baked_chicken_breast_texture_right/,4,"I just came back from a weekend trip where a friend cooked a delicious chicken Marbella dish (recipe below). The original recipe calls for using whole chickens, but my friend and I both used boneless breasts. This morning I decided to try it for myself for the week’s meal prep. As often happens when I bake chicken, the flavor came out well but the breast texture is unpleasant: tough, chewy, a little rubbery, and uneven across each breast. My friend’s version came out great though. What might I be doing wrong to keep getting chicken breast texture so wrong? For reference, the recipe had me marinate the breasts overnight and bake them whole at 350 in a casserole dish submerged in their marinade. It took 45 minutes for their internal temps to even approach 160, at which point I took them out for fear of overcooking them. I knew the outer layers/thinner portions of the breasts were probably over cooking at that point.

In the past, I’ve cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise for thinner pieces. This makes them faster to reach 165, but also less juicy and more prone to drying out. Works ok for grilling but I’ve learned not to do this with baking. I’ve never tried hammering/tenderizing - might that be worth it?

I suspect it might be a meat quality issue (I’m on a budget and buy cheap Walmart chicken breasts), but I’m hoping to get better at preparation that I can at least mitigate that issue since pricier butcher meat isn’t an option.

2 packs of prosciutto (lightly sautéed on low heat for a few minutes each side)    
1/2 bunch of kale (sautéed salted, and wilted with butter).   
6 dry lasagna noodles. 
8 slices provolone cheese.   
1 to 1 1/2cup prepared béchamel sauce    
Chicken broth.   

I started off with my 7x11 and 3 noodles - half of the  prosciutto in a layer, half of the cheese in a layer, all of the béchamel spread out, half of the kale on top. 3 more noodles, prosciutto, kale, cheese. Then fill until the noodles are covered with chicken broth.  Spray some foil and cover and bake @350 for 35 minutes- uncover and bake a further 25. I put mine on a big sheet tray because it did splatter a bit.

Béchamel was not measured, lol approx 4tablespoons melted butter & flour cooked out then whisked in a third cup of milk/cream and a cup of chicken broth.  Also FYI my half bunch of kale filled a gallon food storage bag raw,

Google is useless as all the results for ""apple juice"" and ""yeast"" are for cider making. [This](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/276956270) is the apple juice we have (Pressed apple juice, not from concentrate, with ascorbic acid as the only additive).

>*What legitimate reason could there be for making a dish harder to eat? I've had sauces and food slosh off the plate trying to cut the tail off, it's not like they add any flavor. (I understand if it's a shrimp cocktail or something you're eating with your fingers, but a scampi?)*

The answer in the above context is that while it may be annoying for some, it **does** add flavor [and for other reasons](https://cooktopcove.com/2024/02/28/anyone-know-why-the-tails-are-usually-left-on-shrimp-in-pasta-dishes/) but only because it was *boiled* and not fried. There were overwhelming votes for saying the tails were there to look ""cool"" and do not add flavor.

**Don't believe it. Do your own experiment.**

Take those tails you would have put in a recipe, put them in a mug and fill the mug with boiling water as you would do to make a tea. Let it cool a bit and then take a sip (as you would with tea). To enhance it, add a pinch of salt (as you would add sugar to tea)—take a sip.

Then you'll understand the value to the dish.

This sub is for learning about the world of cooking and how to eat great food at home by learning methods by which to cook, [not succumbing to lack of experience and assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gojy48/why_would_chefs_leave_shrimp_tails_on/).

**HOWEVER**

If you have tried shrimp tails or shells and they were chewy or hurt your throat or they were not crisp, **then you have never had a good one.**

When shrimp tails and shells (and even the heads) are on and fried or shallow fried in HOT OIL, you get a brittle crispy crunchy shell packed with Peking flavor that is akin to the lightest most delightful tempura or thin potato chip you've ever had in your life.

Tasty AND scrumptious as crispy duck skin on a Peking duck, the crispy crunchy blistered skin on a gorgeous slow roasted whole pig, the crunchy skin on a perfectly roasted chicken or turkey, the delightfully flavor packed crispy fish skin on a lightly fried whole fish.

If you've never had an excellent crispy shrimp tail then you are not qualified to confirm one of the top most enjoyable things on the planet to eat that is so easy to make.

[Partner is ""fussy"" about cream (but not cheese)- please suggest an alternative for this broccoli cheese soup : r/Cooking (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gncri6/partner_is_fussy_about_cream_but_not_cheese/)

  
Of all the wonderful suggestions in the OP, I originally decided on adding a few spoonful's of humus, even though it went against the ""cold-climate food should not mix with warm climate food"" principle I have in my head. Commenters pointed out that a/ tahini is very strongly flavoured and will clash with broccoli, b/hummus doesn't have the starchy fat (?) needed to ""bind"" the cheese and make it not weird and stringy. 

So then I pivoted to rice, and then when it came down to it, in the moment, I decided against that too and added a slice of bread. And a tin of chickpeas, mostly because we had an unused but open tin. I used cheddar cheese with habanero added, because that was on sale, and thrift trumps principles in this kind of situation (but not always, it should go without saying). I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen carrot-top leaves from the freezer, to use them up and for extra dark leafy goodness.  

I also didn't wait until the onions were ""soft and golden"" as per the instructions, because that's a made-up thing by recipe-writers. They were kind of mushy when I added everything else.

I did follow the instruction about stirring continuously while adding the cheese to a T, thanks to the commenter who had installed the fear of the cheese becoming ""weird and stringy"" in me. Reader, it did not.  

ANYWAY, the soup turned out very nice. Not creamy, and I do think it will be a different beast with cream and/or butter but very palatable. I burned my mouth. We had it with extra bread (partner), pita chips (me), and green vinegary salad garnished with dill pickles. For dessert, I had a very nice hagen dasz key lime pie pop with a white chocolate cover, partner had corn chips (?!). All in all, a very nice Saturday night meal,   

The leftover soup now has the consistency of concrete. Definitely needs to be loosened with vegetable stock when reheated. It can give us both one additional meal.

I put up a couple of pics of the soup in different stages here: (it's not NSFW).

I've found myself hosting Thanksgiving for my family this year, which I was not planning on. I've hosted before but it's been years and nowadays cooking is a lot more effort for me because of illness and my beautiful little kiddos taking it out of me (lol). I also have a MUCH tinier kitchen than I used to.

Anyway, I am kind of very overwhelmed thinking about it but thinking I can take some of the stress off by cooking some of it the day before. 

I'm planning on:

* turkey
* mashed potatoes
* gravy
* cranberry sauce (might buy this instead of make)
* buttered corn
* baked mac and cheese
* stuffing

I am thinking the mashed potatoes and buttered corn would reheat better than other sides so might do those the day before. I almost want to do the mac and cheese ahead too because I don't think I have oven space to do turkey, stuffing, and mac on the same day but I'm more worried about how that would reheat.  I could do the gravy ahead if I forfeited using pan drippings and bought some broth but idk.

Anyone else cook some of your Thanksgiving ahead before and have experiences or advice to share?

Any recommendations on affordable, durable stainless steel/metal small mixer/grinder/blenders in the US?

My Indian mother loves to grind spices and make chutneys. She needs  a wet & dry small, blender/mixer/grinder.  She manages to break all the affordable ones we have bought for her every year for the past few years. 

So, this time around we want to buy something durable and affordable (ideally < $50) that can fit in her dishwasher & does not crack.  
  
We were intrigued by the Costco Ninja blender at Costco, which will be on a deal soon (https://www.costco.com/ninja-smoothieiq-blender-with-1400-peak-watts%2c-72-oz.-pitcher%2c-and-auto-iq.product.4000262482.html), but it's too big for our needs.

I'm having some friends over for dinner next week and I want to make a chickpea stew. It's a very hearty stew with a currylike flavor: coconut, tumeric, garam masala, lots of garlic and ginger.

For veggies I'm adding a carrot or two, but I'd like to add some leafy greens as well. I'm bored of spinach, so I'm thinking of using bok choy. I figure it should combine nicely with the spices. 

I love bok choy, but I'm not very experienced in preparing it. So I got some questions:

1) I know the stalks go in earlier. Do the stalks get more tasty as they simmer? The stew simmers for about 40 mins, so I could throw in the stalks earlier or closer to the end. 

2) I throw in the leaves at the end, wilting them down. Last time I used bok choy in a curry I found that the leaves made the curry much more watery. How can I prevent this?

I know MSG is a popular additive but because it’s not a “natural” food I think I’m going to avoid it. The more processed an ingredient/food is, the higher risk of cross contamination with corn. What could I use instead for an umami flavour?

Hi everyone,

I run a restaurant where we focus on packing fresh, healthy meals for our customers. One of our main dishes is baked chicken, but I keep running into a frustrating issue: after packing, the chicken develops a really unpleasant smell and a different taste, which is affecting the customer experience.

We bake the chicken fresh daily, so it’s cooked right, but as soon as we pack it, something seems to go wrong. I’m guessing it might have to do with the heat or steam inside the containers, but I’m not entirely sure.

Has anyone here dealt with this problem? Any tips on how to prevent the smell and maintain the taste? I’d really appreciate any advice on packaging techniques, seasoning adjustments, or other tips to keep the chicken tasting as good as when it’s fresh out of the oven. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-11 06:03:35

Having 15 then probably anotehr 4-5 dropping in for dessert so need to augment the apple pie and pumpkin pie with.....  NOT pie.  Was thinking a cranberry version of lemon bars.

Have an elderly houseguest for the week who likes to help.  Let's call her Nonna.  Given her cognitive issues, it's kind of like having a child help - most of what I assign Nonna has to be ""assembly"" and not actual cooking.  Also:  very small ""1-butt"" kitchen anyway, so if it's tasks she can do seated at the kitchen table, all the better.

My idea:  Make & freze short crust (anytime).  Make cranberry curd a few days in advance.  The day before Thanksgiving (or even 2 days) have Nonna press the pastry into pan and bake.  **Later that day or the next day, gently reheat the curd (THIS IS MY ACTUAL QUESTION - can I do this?)** and have Nonna pour/spread it in the pan.  This would either be chilled or baked/chilled, depending on the recipe.

Optional:  a bar recipe w/ some kind of dairy/mascarpone type layer?  Thoughts?  One more thing to make in advance and add to Nonna's assembly.  NOT a bad thing.

I recently started boiling chicken to give to my senior dogs because they have sensitive stomachs. About a week ago, they got sick for a short period of time because I didn’t boil chicken breast properly and didn’t have a meat thermometer, trying to use color as my metric of doneness.

Today, my family bought frozen bone-in chicken thigh which I have no experience in cooking, but was open to trying. I defrosted it and boiled it in a pot for about an hour. I used a meat thermometer and it read 170+ in all the places I put it after trying to find the spots inside the chicken that are of the lowest temperature, but I will admit I struggled to find the innermost places because the chicken was falling off the bone.

Here’s a photo (I know it looks upappetizing lol):

https://imgur.com/a/xx4eThb

If anything, I think I overboiled it due to the stringy, stew-like texture but the end result looked quite dark pink and now I’m paranoid I might’ve given my dogs bad food again.

Can anyone help me understand why it looks so dark? Is it possible it’s still undercooked in some places or is it because it was bone-in?

So this is my first year cooking everything for thanksgiving myself and from scratch. I have everything planned out but I just don’t know what I can prep the day before or what I should cook first? This was my idea and order, advice is appreciated!! 

Turkey: making the brine the day before and letting turkey marinate over night 
Doing garlic butter and rub the day of and baking for 2.5hrs at 400 

Sides:
Broccoli casserole- prepping and making it the day before then putting in fridge over night then topping with breadcrumbs and baking the day of-bake for 30 mins at 350
—this is where I’m a little stuck, I’m making fresh rolls so my own dough, prep time about 35 minutes then baking for 30 at 350, but I’m stuffing them with mozzarella so I want them to but fresh and cheese pulley 
—I’m also making Mac and cheese which I make every year from scratch and it takes about 1hr including prep and baking for about 20 mins at 350, but I make my own cheese sauce and top with cheese and also want that to be hot and fresh!! 
(Do I cook the turkey last? Will it be okay to cook before the rolls and Mac and cheese?)
—roast carrots I was going to bake them the last 30 mins with the turkey since they need a 400 degree over too 

Dessert: I’m making a pumpkin pie but the day before will it be okay or will the crust get soggy? Should I throw it in the oven to crisp up again day of? 

Also making gravy but that’s just 30 mins on stove and not in the oven 

I just don’t want anything getting old or not too freshness by the time I serve!!

If any of you have any idea for recipes or ideas to get her to eat a well rounded diet I would really love to hear them.

So far I've used a pancake recipe I found here and I blended up some lasagna with extra sauce and some spinach (shhhh she doesn't know) to get her some veggies. What she's been enjoying so far is the usual, apple sauce, ice cream, mashed potatoes, pudding, yogurt and vanilla protein shakes. I just know she can't get through the next 6 weeks on just those foods. She would literally rather starve than eat something she doesn't like.

Here are some of her favorite foods: Cheese burgers (not blender friendly), chicken tenders, mac and cheese, pizza, etc. Very much what you would find on the kids menu at any American restaurant.

Things she will absolutely NOT eat: rice, beans, and corn. I know that beans would be such a great way to add some more protein to her diet but it's a texture thing and it's the same with rice (she's never liked it).

  
ETA: I did not mean to insinuate that she would not eat anything but the above mentioned foods. These are just her favorite things to eat. The list of things she does not like is also not complete she doesn't like chocolate flavored things. ",2024-11-10 14:35:23

I'm German and never liked green beans until a couple of years ago. 
I looked up some recipes and found a warning from a government agency, stating that raw green beans are very toxic. 
10 raw green beans can be lethal for a child, some more can take an adult out. 


So, you should ALWAYS boil those green beans for at least 10 minutes and then discard the water. 


I've been doing that ever since, but of course I always get mushy veggies that way. 


Whenever I look at Chinese or US recipes, the green beans seem to get heated for only a very short amount of time, like 3-4 minutes max.


Do we have different green beans? 
Are just us Germans such wimps that go to a hospital because of food? 
Did the government lie to me? 

I am confused.

Oh my god, some of those comments. Why do some people get SO angry?

cooking,1gngajc,"""Meat and Potatoes"" for large crowd guidance",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gngajc/meat_and_potatoes_for_large_crowd_guidance/,43,"Soon, I'll be cooking a birthday lunch for my FIL. Appetizers and some sides will be brought by guests and the host, and I've been given a specific request for a dessert, so I'm not worried about that. The only guidance I got for the main meal was ""meat and potatoes"", and my mind immediately went to beef.

Initially, my plan was to do a pot roast. However, the guest list has since double from 6 to 12, and I don't think I have the right equipment to make enough pot roast. Additionally, the lunch is at my in-laws house, about an hour from home, and the logistics of making a double batch at home and then reheating it there or arriving very early to attempt to make it there are both overwhelming me.

I saw a years-old [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/10mobyi/how_the_heck_do_i_cook_10_steaks/) on r/AskCulinary about cooking 10 steaks for a party, to which one of the responses suggested searing all the steaks, allowing them to all come to room temperature, and then finishing them in the oven together. This idea definitely has me interested, but I am left with a few specific questions:

1.) rough idea of oven finishing time? (I'll be finishing to med-rare temp, probably)  
2.) oven temp  
3.) sheet pan, sheet pan with rack, roasting pan?  
4.) covered or uncovered  
5.) cut of beef?  
6.) ""this plan is terrible don't do any of it""?

I am open to any and all suggestions that help me feed 12 people, and I'm not afraid to spend some money and all my time making it happen.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your suggestions. I've abandoned the steak idea entirely, and as many of you have recommended I'm making cottage pie. I have a recipe that's gone over incredibly well in the past with the same people, so I know it will be a crowdpleaser.",2024-11-09 18:18:49

I have a bit of an unconventional Thanksgiving situation, so I was hoping for some help brainstorming.

I **despise** traditional Thanksgiving food (turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberries, Stovetop instant stuffing, etc.) -- so I have this tradition where, every year on Thanksgiving, I make myself my own special meal.  For example, last year I made a ""mock ceviche"" (all the standard ingredients of ceviche, but cooked rather than having the rawness of traditional ceviche).  In previous years, I've featured such entrées for myself as roasted duck, Cornish game hen, or Ina Garten's ""baked shrimp scampi"" (to name a few more examples).

So, this year, I think I want to make my ""exotic Thanksgiving entrée"" be something that uses ribeye steak/beef as its centerpiece.  I was hoping you all could help me brainstorm some potential ideas (including actual recipes, if you have any).

Some parameters...

\-- Where I live, it's way too cold to grill outside during this time of year; so I need to come up with a recipe that can be done either in the oven or on the stovetop

\-- I'd love to do a marinade (especially one involving soy sauce), because I've found ribeye to be extremely scrumptious when marinated

\-- It would be an extra bonus if there was some way I could incorporate bacon into this dish, somehow

Any ideas for me?

I'm coming up on 1 year sober next week.  This would definitely not have been possible without the amazing staff of the rehab facility I was treated at. I'm struggling to put into words how immensely grateful I am. They were so kind and supportive, they shared their wisdom, pushed me when I needed it, held space for me when I needed it. They saved my life, quite literally.

I won't ever be able to repay them or return the favor. But I want to celebrate my sobriety by visiting the rehab facility and giving them a gift. During my time there I noticed them snacking on stuff as a team, so I think they'll appreciate that. I was thinking some homemade cookies? 

I would really appreciate it if someone could share a fool proof recipe for cookies? Maybe some decadent cookies - to really spoil them? It would be cool if there's a recipe that can be altered a little so I can bake different kinds and offer them a selection?

In not a good cook, but I'm totally prepared to give it my all and go all the way.

(I could of course just Google a recipe, but maybe someone has a special recipe that I can use, to give it some more meaning?)

What type of pastry dough should I use for the dessert described below?

Esssntially, what I want to do is:
- lay down two concentric tart rings (12"" and 6"") to create an O. 
- Par-bake a crust within the rings, then add a layer of apple pie-esque filling with a little gelatin or something for structure. Bake to set.
- Pipe an almond pastry cream on top of the apple layer. Remove the tart rings.
- Make an additional ring of pastry crust layered with thin sliced apples. Bake them together so the apples get embedded in the crust. 
- Cover the second pastry ring with a hard setting glaze to make it nice and shiny, also improve the structural integrity of the second pastry ring.
- take the second pastry ring and lay it on top of the first crust/apple/cream layer.
- basically creates a ringed apple napoleon of sorts.

I'm a bit overwhelmed. I can easily throw together a vanilla Thanksgiving dinner, but I'd like to try brining the turkey. Never done a brine before, at least not at this scale.

Here's what I've gathered so far:

- some number of hours (up to 24 for best results) before showtime, prepare a brine of X% salt to water ratio, maybe some sugar too, idk

- put the turkey in it

- keep it around fridge temp until it's time to dry it and throw it in the oven

That's great and all, but that's gonna be a bit difficult for me and my single refrigerator to manage. I'm probably cooking two birds.

Here's my current plan, sans brine:

- de-bone both birds

- separate each bird into 4 separate vacuum bags

- chuck in the freezer, ready to pull out and start thawing on game day.

- thaw and bake normally

I'd like to be able to cut open the bags the day before, chuck in some brine, re-vacuum-seal, and keep these in the fridge overnight - I should be able to handle a bunch of sealed floppy bags in the fridge.

That plan seems tenable, but I can't figure out the minimum amount of water I need or how to measure the appropriate amount of salt, et al. All research I've done ends up at an ai-generated garbage article without useful info or a guide on how to do large volume submersible brining.

Can anyone point me toward how to do what I'm looking for?

It seems to me like it wouldn't make any difference if you just left the pepper off, and just added it after the meat was ready to serve.

cooking,1gnef0j,Salting Proteins before Cooking/Dry Brining.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gnef0j/salting_proteins_before_cookingdry_brining/,16,"Hello all! I’m an experienced cook, always learning, and I’d like to discuss salting and dry brining. I do use a dry brining calculator and I weigh out the salt so I can be scientific and consistent.

The consensus seems to be to salt and season your proteins to let the salt absorb and essentially “dry brine”. I seem to be getting inconsistent results and I’d like to understand why. Sometimes my proteins come out noticeably dry, and I’m confident in the cooking methods and temperatures that I’m using (please don’t suggest times and temps).

We should all know that salting a protein draws out moisture (bad!), but then shortly after, the moisture gets reabsorbed with the salt (good!). 

What I’m beginning to question is that sometimes it feels like the moisture (or some of it) that gets drawn out during the salting does not end up getting reabsorbed, therefore leaving me with noticeable dryness. 

In your experiences, is there a hard minimum time to allow the salt to sit, or a rule on pre-salting when it comes to certain proteins or thicknesses? Are there some meats or fish that you don’t bother pre-salting? And why not? What are some rules or techniques that you have developed or adapted over the years when it comes to preseasoning meats and fish? Should all salted proteins be left to dry out in open air? Some that shouldn’t? 

Thanks for any advice!!",2024-11-09 16:55:13

3 Flat head Mushrooms (I love Mushies, but not the texture)
1 clove Garlic
1 60g bag of Baby Spinach. 
Start chopping it all down in the hand chopper. Takes minutes.
Add Basil, Oregano, Rosemary and Thyme, plus Steak Spice and Roast Vegetable spice. Chop again to mix thoroughly.

Add 500ml Pure Cream
240gm Greek Yogurt
2 tablespoons Mild American Mustard
Chop again to mix thoroughly.

With your steak, salt and pepper it, then sear.
remove steak, add sauce to the steaks pan and cook for 10 seconds.
Add Steak. Cook to preference.

With the left over sauce, I pour a little on the steak when I serve, and add more to my Potato and Sweet Potato, which I then mash together.

1. Would you rather cook a whole bird or just breast? 
2. Use drippings for homemade gravy or rest the bird/breast on stuffing? 
3. I plan to use injection for the first time this year. Can I skip brining because of that?

Then I add 3x tinned tomatoes, tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, some bay leaves, a dissolved stock pot and some sliced cherry/salad tomatoes.

I bring it up to the boil, add some dried oregano then reduce it down for two hours.

The finished sauce looks amazing, but has a slightly nasty bitterness and is missing the depth of restaurant/shop bought sauce.

I’m not keen on adding sugar, but I’ve been reading maybe some cream and then fresh basil at the end 

  
HELP!


EDIT:

So the overall answers have been to lose the vinegar, lose the bay leaf, sweat and caramelise the onions for way longer (about 30mins) in oil to release as much natural sugar. Also add tomato’s puree. 
Then add garlic and sweat for a couple of mins.
(The garlic and onion and carrots should be finely chopped)
Then add the tinned toms but they must be high quality, not cheap junk own brand from big name shops.
Then at the end add minimal dried oregano (many people saying that too much of the dried herb goes bitter if cooked for too long) or fresh basil and perhaps a chunk of butter or glug of olive oil.
Other options were a bit of miso at the end, soy sauce. 
Another idea I saw a couple of times was added chopped anchovies for some extra something.

cooking,1gn9i2x,Question for professional chefs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gn9i2x/question_for_professional_chefs/,7,"The question:

Is there a food/ingredient that you do not like the taste and/or the texture of or that you find completely disgusting? Do you think that your culinary growth has been stunted because of your particular food aversion?

The reason I ask this is because it seems that most chefs have such a palette that can appreciate every type and taste of food. I've rarely seen a chef -- in real life and online -- express disgust for a particular food. That disgust being from their own experience of the taste or texture; this does NOT include the ethics behind obtaining a certain food such as overfeeding geese for fois gras or allergies to foods such as shellfish/nuts. 

Another reason for my asking is because I had to learn to make eggs Benedict for a disabled loved one at least 4 times a week. I think eggs Benedict is one of the most disgusting foods on the planet -- from the sauce to the eggs themselves. I gag at the thought of runny egg yolk. While I had the person taste test every step of the way until I got the recipe down, I believe the time I spent learning to appropriately cook it would have been reduced by at least 75% if I had enjoyed eating eggs Benedict myself, which I do not. 

Same goes with mushrooms, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Admittedly, I have always been a picky eater, but I have drastically expanded my tastes since early adulthood. 

I was force-fed cream of mushroom soup when I was around 3-4 years old, and it was my earliest memory -- and it still remains a hateful and disgusting one. Hence, my hatred of mushrooms. Ketchup, mayonnaise, and runny egg yolk are all in the same boat. 

So, chefs, what are the ingredients that you abhor?

We’ve all been drained physically and emotionally and need this comfort food day. Any advice on what I can do to salvage them? Do I run to the store and prep 20 more pounds of them to wake up and bake in the morning? (Kidding, but that’s what anxious brain is telling me to do…)

Edit to add: I’m gonna take them out of the foil and ziploc them and reheat in the crockpots tomorrow and it’ll be fine. I posted this like four minutes after taking them out of the oven lol. ",2024-11-08 03:17:18

cooking,1gmplpo,Best Steak Secret,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gmplpo/best_steak_secret/,26,"A friend years ago worked at a steak house and recommended I try adding cinnamon to my marinade.

I did and have used cinnamon on steaks since.

My per steak marinade for small sirloin or 5oz filet mignon is:



tbsp olive oil,



splash of Worcestershire,



1/2 tsp minced garlic,



two twists of sea salt grinder,



three twists of mixed pepper corns grinder,



dash of cumin,



dash of cinnamon and



dash of crushed red pepper.



That is enough to coat both sides generously, so a little oil comes out from under if you fry in a skillet. (I cover my skillet in a screen.)

I cook medium rare; I flip the steaks when blood shows on top (about three minutes for sirloin, a little longer for 1.5"" filets), remove when bloods come to top again.)



Mwah!



My mirepoix variant is to add an extra drizzle of olive oil around the skillet and add sliced onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, celery, basil which I cover the steak on the serving plate with. You need to keep an eye on the mirepoix as they can scorch and ""Ah..."" becomes ""Ew!""",2024-11-08 18:35:49

Today? Minimal salt, little smoke or pork flavor, almost no fat except for what's left in the hocks, and so little meat as to be worthless to try to chop and incorporate into the dish.

I'm so tired. Every bone in me aches. But I finally finished what I've been putting off. I wanted to follow an AI version of traditional tamales but I kept the ingredients simple just so that I can understand how the foundation works like moisture of the masa and cook time when steaming. I had to go to my local Seafood City in Vegas to get some bamboo steamers like I'm making Dim Sum. Worth every bit of sweat and tree puffs to get On Demand Tamales I can reheat from the freezer. Also very sorry but the mobile app won't let me upload the photos for some reason. 

AI generated recipe for tamales:

Dough:
20 cups of masa harina
15 cups of warm broth or warm water (though because I didn't know shit, I used cold water so I ended up adding 11 cups of water more to the masa, total 26 cups liquids)
5 Tbsp salt (I forgot to add the salt to the filling so I compensated by adding more salt to the dough)
3 bags of corn husks
5 tsp baking powder (optional)

Filling: 
8.2 lbs pork shoulder
3 Tbsp cumin
2 Tbsp rosemary
1 Tbsp thyme

Turn crock pot full of pork shoulder, cumin, rosemary and thyme and top with water on high for 6 hours, then bring down the heat and simmer on low for 18 hours, flipping the meat over gingerly halfway through. When it's close to the 18 hr mark, start preparing the masa.

In a very large bowl or serving dish, loosely measure and combine 20 cups of masa, 15 cups of warm broth or warm water until the mixture resembles hummus and wet mortar. Mix in salt and baking powder until fully incorporated. Soak cork husks until soft and pliable. Spread a small biscuit sized dollop of masa onto the wide end of a husk and spread from left to right to where it covers 60% of the right side of the tamale if the small end is pointing left, leaving 1"" off the edge so you have room to roll and excess filling will have a space to spread out. You'll want to spread a 1/4"" thick for each masa so you get to really taste the meat. 

Take about 2-3 tbps of filling and line it along the inside of the masa along one edge. Then roll the masa over the filling and tuck the bottom corner behind.

Steam the tamales for 1.5 hours, checking every 45 mins to see if the tamale doesn't cling to the corn husk. I ended up cooking it for 3 hours each batch to ensure the overhydrated masa was thoroughly cooked. 

Yields: 125-130 tamales

However, when I am on these mental lows, cooking is all I think about no matter awake or asleep. I know it is a defense mechanism to avoid thinking about my current problems, which happens to be a rocky almost breakup situation out of a 6 year relationship. But, being aware of it does not minimize the damage, because I have no control of my thoughts anymore, I binge watch cooking videos, documentaries, cooking competitions and reality TVs shows, I read a lot of culinary books and fiction.

I was asking around about adding cocoa butter or palm kernel oil to lower the melting point; achieve a ""melt-in-your-mouth"" effect while still crunchy with sugar and nuts. I did a some research and adding heavy cream seemed to be the simplest answer - on top of temp/time/technique - to add more heft in fluff (cream) to chew. I'll be making a very large batch so homogeneity is important; Soy Lecithin has came to my attention as it may help after adding more cream and increasing the temperature toward soft crack.

I would appreciate some help with a recipe. Unfortunately, Reddit is not allowing me to upload pictures.

Then, I boiled them. The colours were inconsistent. The butterfly pea flower was super dark, the green was very mute, but also varied in hue, and the pink varied too. Why?

Is it the boiling? The dye from natural foods? Some filling leaked out in a few dumplings. Would this affect colour loss of dough? Would the blue dough being so sticky affect results?

Typically I add them and hour or so after the beef along with the other veg, I have issues with them being somehow hard and soft at the same time or alternatively flat out disintegrating.

I've tried a few things, 

pre boiling them.
Putting them in raw unrinsed.
Raw and rinsed.

Usually they end up having a somewhat ""chewy"" feel, the outer skin is hard but inside it's fairly soft.

(These are always peeled by the way)

I've tried everything I can think of so figured I'd come to the professionals lol (for reference I've used maris piper potatoes and small salad potatoes, same result with both)

Ive bought a carbon steel wok and i wanted to season it so i searched up videos and blog posts and what not. 
But as it sometimes is, things dont end up like on the internet 
I tried seasoning it yesterday and it got some funky bubbles on the bottom of it and i thought to leave it at that and try today again. 
But today, i tried again. I scrubbed it good, to get rid of whatever could get off it and then i redid all the steps. I used paper towels and oil, i didnt lather too much, and then again, it started bubbling (and i couldnt finish it because my apartment wass full of smoke). 
Are these normal? Should i try and scrub it and then try again? Where did i go wrong?
I can not attach photos but its like little bubbles on the bottom of it that could be patina but when you scratch them, they come out and you can see the clean steel under it. 
What should i do?

cooking,1gmxfss,Frying eggs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gmxfss/frying_eggs/,19,"Can't find a comprehensive theory so I've made one up. Comments welcome.

The surface of a pan is not smooth on a microscopic level, it is covered in scratches and hollows.
When you heat a pan, these discontinuities expand.
If you heat the pan to the correct temperature and drip liquid onto it, the Leidenfrost effect occurs. The liquid creates a layer of vapor that insulates it from the hot surface, preventing it from boiling quickly. The liquid levitates above the surface instead of making physical contact.

Egg white consists of globular proteins and water molecules.
Globular proteins are long molecule which are twisted and folded and curled up into a more or less spherical shape. A variety of weak chemical bonds keep the protein curled up tight as it drifts placidly in the water that surrounds it.

When you crack an egg into a hot pan, the water molecules at the bottom of the white evaporate.
The heat in the pan agitates the egg-white proteins breaking the weak bonds that kept them curled up. The egg proteins uncurl and new chemical bonds form a network of interconnected proteins some of which sink into the discontinuities in the pan surface.

The cold egg reduces the temperature of the pan and the discontinuities contract gripping the egg-white protein and making the egg stick.
The degree if sticking may be reduced by covering the base of the pan with a film of oil and ensuring that the temperature of the pan is high enough to trigger the Leidenfrost effect.

As the egg cooks, the water molcules around the egg-white protein string lattices in the discontinuities are driven off. The proteins contract and are no longer gripped unsticking the egg.

cooking,1gm9qyt,Can I save my grilled chicken? ,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gm9qyt/can_i_save_my_grilled_chicken/,6,"Hi all. 

I recently acquired a new grill. I have been obsessed, and I’m cooking everything on it. 
It’s been a lot of fun making burgers and hotdogs on it regularly but I’ve been trying to branch out. 

Enter the chicken. 

I found a recipe that involves coating the chicken in a dry bbq rub, and once it reaches temp., doing a light coating of bbq sauce that would leave caramelized finish. I also oiled the grates so the chicken wouldn’t stick when flipping. 

The recipe called for 30 minutes of cooking, flipping every ten minutes. 

Results:
- the chicken itself took much longer to cook than the recipe (to get to safe temp). Instead of 30 minutes, it took an hour. Temp was around 400 degrees during cook. Flipped it every 10 minutes. 

- the skin would not crisp and was chewy. Almost inedible. 

-the chicken itself was delicious and juicy. Wife loved this part of the chicken. 

Possible mistakes:
- I was in a rush and missed patting the chicken exterior down with paper towels like I normally do when using an oven recipe. 

- I think I didn’t give the chicken enough time to come up to temp after pulling from the refrigerator. 
I was planning about 30 minutes but ended up setting in grill after 15min.

The fix? -
Since half the chicken is turning into leftovers, is there anyway to salvage the chicken? Mainly the skin. It’s already chewy and I’m wondering if I can flash fry it in a pan tomorrow with a little oil to fix the exterior. 

I would love any feedback on other possible mistakes I may have made, and would love to hear y’all’s thoughts. 

Thank you!

I’m trying to really exercise my cooking muscles and try new, fancier things for my fam and extended family. Recently I made Porcini Tagliatelle completely from scratch—and brioche bread completely from scratch—and I’ve been dabbling in traditional French cooking too, but I feel as though I’ve recently hit a wall, recipes-wise. It’s my budget. And also my family is full of picky eaters. For example: no dark meats of any kind, no olives, no mangos, no seafood, no rice, no super duper uper spicy stuff, no coconuts, no pasta, no deep fried anything, nothing TOO ethnically adventurous—AT THIS POINT I THINK MY OPTIONS ARE CHICKEN AND TOAST SANDWICHES. Sorry, started venting for a second. *ahem* So I’m limited because of personal preferences and I’m limited because of budget. When we bought those Porcini mushrooms (40g) I got an earful. Apparently I am not to splurge like that again “especially on something like mushrooms.” If it were me, I’d be experimenting with truffles and lobster and calamari and diving into the worlds of Asian cuisine, African cuisine, South American—my dad LOVES when I make empanadas, but since it’s a DeEp FrIeD fOoD we always get an earful from my Step-Mom, so I’m only allowed to make them on special occasions—but back on topic…
…
…
Are you starting to see my struggle? I bought two French cookbooks recently and I’ve been loving reading them and making some of the recipes, HOWEVER, I am unable to make all of them because of either, 1) seafood, or 2) expensive cut of meat, or 3) expensive other ingredients, or 4) a bit too out of my skillset at the moment, or 5) I don’t have the right tools. So I’ve exhausted my cookbooks. Searching online isn’t helpful because all I get are “SUPER EASY MEALS YOU CAN MAKE IN FIVE MINUTES!!!” And it’s always a rotation of the same, like, eight or so dishes. “Pasta, pizza, burgers, chilli, enchiladas, assorted SOUPS, parmesan chicken, and/or some form of tacos.” I’m looking for not-basic-white-American-dinners-you-can-make-in-five-minutes-or-less-with-kraft-singles. Something not too expensive, but not cheap, that could feed 10 people, with a salad or vegetable dish, a carby side (probably some kind of bread—not sourdough), and a meaty main dish, plus a dessert (but there can’t be any chocolate in the dessert). (note: I do not have ramekins yet, so that’s a limiter, but I DO have a blowtorch >:D)  Yes, I do plan on looking for more recipe books soon, but for the moment I’m in a bit of a bind. Does anyone out there in the void have any good ideas? I really like it when a dish is super specific—like, since it’s fall, I was thinking maybe something to do with brussles sprouts? Or squash perhaps? Most likely, the meat will be chicken… but I love it when it’s not a basic chicken dish. Still, I’m open to all suggestions at this point. I understand if I’m a bit of a hopeless case, what with all the restrictions and such, so rest assured I do have a backup plan, I’d just… rather not go with the backup plan if I don’t have to. Help.

I'm looking to cook a dinner for my friends as i am leaving for a year, but am a bit conflicted on what i should do. I'm a student so i don't have a TON of money but i can afford to spend a bit.   
I'm also not a completely incompetent cook, having both cooked as a bit of a hobby and been a volunteer working in a kitchen.

We're all meat lovers and i've cooked steak before, and I'm prone to cook mainly American/Western European dishes as that's what i like the best and can actually make.

I've considered some burgers, like really putting in some work. I've also looked into maybe doing the classic Danish dish (We are Danish) Stægt flæsk med Persillesovs.

If anyone knows some recipies that kinda fits my ""Theme"" and are also not insanely expensive, i would really appreciate it!

I'm an adult and have been cooking for myself for years and years and never had this problem until now.

Lately whenever I try to cook anything the seasoning just gets burnt to hell. Crispy black gunk everywhere, horrible taste and smell, ruins the dish and whatever pan its in. Wine/butter/oil smokes up to the point where I've been afraid of setting my fire alarm off, which would be pretty embarrassing as I live in a big building.

Mind you, I come from a family where sautéing things in butter/oil/wine/garlic as previously mentioned was the norm, so I've been super depressed at having to make everything bland. I simply cannot tolerate plain chicken with barely any seasoning any longer. I used to be able to cook steaks to a perfect medium rare but now it gets covered in a black layer of soot before the middle is even warm.

The only thing I can think of as a relevant factor was that I recently moved and started using an electric stove as that is what my unit has.

I tried doing the same technique i was successful with the butter with the ghee and the results have been awful. The eggs stick horrendously to the pan and cannot be freed up. I end up with destroyed eggs and a bunch of very stuck crispy egg bits in the pan.

The Zoji costs 400 euros and the YumAsia Bamboo is 230 euros. I've seen almost no bad reviews of the Zoji, if any, but have seen some about the Bamboo not withstanding time or leaking condensed liquids etc. The TSQ at 310 euros could be something in the middle without GABA.

I do want the Zoji GAQ because it feels and looks nicest, but the price becomes a question. I know the zoji probably wont be 170 euros better at cooking rice compared to the bamboo, but how about its durability and expected use age? How would the 2 Zojis compare to each other? The bamboo being 8 cups could be too big.

Is there any chance in the world that the zoji can actually be worth almost double the price in comparison by any metric? Then again if I really want a Zoji, maybe it should be the TSQ? Im not even 100% I would use GABA Brown, but if I tried brown rice I would probably want that mode.

This game-changing dessert is a must-try for all blueberry lovers out there. With a buttery crust, a tangy cream cheese filling, and a burst of fresh blueberry flavor, this tart is sure to impress your friends and family. Follow along as we take you through a step-by-step guide on how to make this stunning dessert. From prep to plate, I've got you covered!

**Full ingredients list:**

For the Sweet Shortcrust Pastry: 1 ½ cups (190g) all-purpose flour ½ cup (115g) unsalted butter, cold ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar 1 large egg yolk 1-2 tablespoons cold water, as needed

For the Cream Cheese Filling: 350g cream cheese ½ cup (100g) icing sugar or granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream

For the Blueberry Topping: 2 ½ cups (370g) frozen or fresh blueberries 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons water

**Step by step guide**

1. Prepare the Sweet Shortcrust Pastry:

Combine flour, sugar, and cold butter in a bowl until the mixture is crumbly. Add the egg yolk, then gradually add cold water until a dough forms. Press the dough into a tart pan, prick the base with a fork, and bake at 180°C (350°F) until golden. Let cool completely.

2. Make the Cream Cheese Filling:

Beat the softened cream cheese with sugar and vanilla extract until smooth. Separately whip the chilled heavy cream to soft peaks, then fold it into the cream cheese mixture to achieve a light, creamy texture.

Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cooled tart crust.

3. Prepare the Blueberry Topping:

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch mixed with water. Simmer until the berries release their juices and the mixture thickens into a sauce. Spoon the blueberry topping over the filling.

I’m fairly new to cooking and I want to become better. When watching/reading recipes, no one ever mentions the kind of oil they use.

I know oils have different smoke points, so that will determine what is needed for what you are cooking. People also mention “neutral oils”.  I’m confused on what’s best to just cook things in a pan. Like if I wanted to cook some vegetables. (I know vegetable oil is best for frying chicken and other things etc)

It’s just a lot of information and it’s hard to find good answers by just searching. Every answer is different. I’m not afraid of seed oils however I am trying to lose weight and those tend to have higher calories. I’ve heard avocado oil is widely used.

Hi Folks. 

So, wife and I went to Italy and the Bolognese sauce was freakin amazing. I decided to try to emulate said sauce starting with Marcella Hazan’s recipe and fresh made linguine and it was pretty darn good if I say so myself. The only problem was I used my wife’s Le Creuset 8qt (?) cooker and that thing seems to take forever to boil the water. During my distinguished career as a dishwasher at a seafood joint in Cape Cod, when I was young, I think most of the stock pots/ cook pots the chefs threw at me were made w/ thick aluminum so I’m trying to learn the differences.

Questions:
- Does the Le Creuset take longer than aluminum or stainless to get water to a boil or is it my imagination?
- I think I read that aluminum boils water the fastest, is that true?
- When I search sauce pot on Amazon, they push mostly stainless at me. Matter of fact, it seems hard to find heavy gauge sauce pots like I washed in restaurants but there seem to be plenty around restaurant supply sites.
- What about the aluminum clad in stainless?

Obviously, you can tell I’m not a professional cook but I’m getting really good at it! (Greek parents on both sides helped my taste buds a lot).

We own the #26 Le Creuset is about 5.5 quarts. That seems to be the perfect size for my needs.
So, I’m looking for answers and suggestions on what brand/size/type pot I might consider. The Le Creuset holds about 5.5 quarts and that size seems fine but a little bigger is fine too.   

Please weigh in with advice, brands, sizes or any suggestions you might have on my sauce pot endeavors!

Thanks in advance!

We're having friends over this weekend so there will be 4 adults and 2 kids. We're thinking of doing something like a curried butternut squash soup with crusty bread and a pear gorgonzola salad. But it feels like it might need a sandwich. 

OR
 
Maple root bear pulled pork sandwiches with the pear salad, but then a lighter soup. 

How would you complete this?

For the salad recipie:

Put 3 or 4 sliced anjou pears on a baking sheet. Bake at 350f for 10 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile toss 2c of whole walnuts with olive oil and brown sugar, and spread of a separate baking sheet. 

Take the pears out, put the walnuts in for 10 minutes.

For the dressing mix half a cup olive oil, a quarter cup balsamic, 2 tbls of maple syrup, dash of dijon, a minces garlic clove and salt and pepper to taste.

After everything is cool toss mixed greens. With gorgonzola walnuts pears and dried cranberries, and dress lightly. ",2024-11-07 02:49:57

cooking,1gl2wf7,Failure and replacement of induction range,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1gl2wf7/failure_and_replacement_of_induction_range/,4,"Hello all, I figured I would get this info out there in case someone needs it.

  
We purchased a GE Profile induction range in Nov 2022 (model PCHS920YMFS) for $3300 CAD. Feedback:

* I liked the touch panel but the overall shape of the top and controls stuck out a fair ways from the countertop and cabinet (but we got used to it).
* It was \*very\* loud. We had an induction stove in our previous house and I'm used to a bit of coil whine, but this was much louder. The other issue was that the power supply for the controller itself made a hissing noise whenever the unit was operating and while it was cooling down. Definitely audible in the next room, you could tell when the cooktop had cooled off as the noise would go away.
* Fast-forward to October 2024: while cooking Thanksgiving dinner, I had the oven at 400 F and was using two burners at med - high power. Around 5 PM, the cooktop stopped working entirely, with the controls flashing whenever I turned it back on.
* I tried letting the cooktop cool off but the flashing controls issue kept happening. I found a similar issue here on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/douvEvr5qDQ)
* I played around with it for a few more days and found that I could run the burners around medium power but if I went too high the cookware would audible buzz very loudly and then the cooktop turned itself off
* After a few days of limping along like this, the cooktop failed entirely, and would turn itself off after 3-5 seconds of use
* After accessing the error codes (hold Broil + 2 for a few seconds), error F640 was showing as active, and I could get the counter to increase by turning the cooktop off and having it fail again.
* Based on F640 and a few other error codes, the troubleshooting manual indicated that at least one of the gen boards and the main controller needed replacing, and the repair tech agreed, to the tune of $1400 plus a min. 6 week wait for parts.

So based on that we bought a new range entirely, the LG LSIL6332FE for $1900 CAD (minus a $250 rebate gift card from LG). Feedback:

* VERY quiet, especially compared to the GE. Minimal coil whine and there is no other noise from the other electronics
* Controls are a bit sparse, you have to press +/- to set and adjust the cooktop power and oven temperature as opposed to the GE's dials and numberpad

So far so good on the LG. I wouldn't touch another GE appliance with a 10 ft pole. Certainly an extended warranty would have helped, but keeping a $3300 appliance on life support for 5 years isn't really a practical solution.

I am trying to switch the family from white Basmati to whole grain for health purposes. The problem is that I make really good white basmati, and I haven’t quite figured out how to translate that to brown. 

I’m still using the same brand as before (Tilda if that’s relevant) and here is what I’ve tried: 

1. Tried cooking it like I do white: 1 cup dry rice, soaked in cold water for ~30 mins, drained and rinsed, added to pot with some butter, sautéed for ~5 mins, + 2 Cups of chicken broth, simmer until liquid absorbed. This resulted in rice that was still stiff, and covered in a white residue - looks like maybe some grains “exploded” during cooking and it may be starch? 

2. Tried cooking it according to the Tilda directions: bring large pot of water to boil (~5 L), add rice and cook for 25 minutes, drain & let sit for a few minutes. This resulted in a slightly more tender grain, but still had more of a bite than rice typically does. This time a lot of the grains looked as if they had “exploded”, a lot were curled like shrimp, and it had the possible starch residue again. 

Google hasn’t been helpful in providing alternatives to the two methods I’ve already tried, so I’m hoping there’s someone out there who has cracked the code and is willing to share! ",2024-11-06 23:05:50

What is the best order of operations here? I'm thinking: (1) boil the frozen crab legs, (2) throw them in to poach in butter+wine with the mussels, lobster and shrimp, (3) make the fettucine alfredo, (4) pan sear the scallops, (5) plate and serve.

I was thinking to cook them for 2 hours on the kamado on Friday morning, take them out to cool down to room temperature and rest, seal in vacuum bags and then put in the fridge until Saturday where I will continue the slow cook in a conventional oven for 3/4 hours at the house we're staying at.

I was up at 4 o’clock every morning and in bed at 7 PM, my day consisted of waking up, going to the gym, coming home, making breakfast and lunch, going to work coming home cooking dinner, then going to sleep. I did this for almost a year.

As you can tell that it’s quite a drain draining lifestyle. So essentially I crashed. Pretty much one day just woke up and stopped. In the last two years, I say I have cooked maybe 25 25 times. Apart from maybe a bowl of cereal in the morning and some snacks, I’ve been purchasing breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day. Obviously this has been quite expensive. It’s been  breakfast sandwiches from McDonald’s Starbucks, and Tim Hortons every day, mostly fast food for lunch, I try to make healthier options, but obviously it’s fast food so you can only get so healthy. And then most nights were the same thing, with going out to an actual restaurant, probably three times a week.

The last week I have pretty much went decided that I’m not eating out anymore. Stocked up on all the greens I needed plan my meals and have been cooking. However, I don’t seem to have any motivation to make “ healthy“ food. I’ve made a few different chicken and pork dishes, usually with rice or noodles. Usually with higher calorie sources. Or higher calorie pastas. 

I feel the choices I was making eating out are better than the choices. I’m making cooking at home. However. When I eat in a restaurant, I have no control over the amount of salt, sugar or fat they use. At least at home I can try and make healthier decisions.  I’m trying to figure if eating “healthier“ fast food for every meal of every day I was actually healthier. Or if my “unhealthy” food I’m making at home is healthier. Just so clear I’m still making smart decisions where I can. But instead of making egg white omelet, I’m making regular omelet with cheese. I know that the omelet with cheese and make it home and more calories every morning than the omelet bites. I would get at Starbucks, what calories and everything and I feel like cooking at home must be healthier. 

I know there are a lot of unknowns here  as my exact diet is really going to decide how healthy it was. But I feel no matter how unhealthy the food I make it home is, there is no way it could be as unhealthy of eating out every meal of every day",2024-11-06 19:42:17

I know what goes together, what things are, what something needs more of etc, but given i only recently moved out on my own i’ve never had to actively make food, so i struggle with basic things like when to use a stove, how long, on what heat etc. My dad who loves to cook so much he’d like to own a restaurant tells me i make better sauces then him tho. So sunday is fathers day and i’ve decided to take a crack at a chilli sauce as a gift for him given he always makes some for his friends. I have some idea where to begin after a basic google. For example i’ve figured out i should likely use cayenne pepper since it’s a step up from jalopeño (where i’m personally comftrable), but then i don’t know how much to put in or how? Do i squish it into a paste? Do i take the seeds out? I’ve also decided to go more mediterranian style as that’s my own confort zone (i’m not from the mediterranian tho), what would one put into a mediterranian chilli sauce? How does one make chilli sauce thicker? Just with flour like other sauces? What type of flour? Please don’t send me recipes as i have never and will never follow a recipe, i much perfer to make stuff up. Thank you everyone!",2024-11-06 02:24:07
