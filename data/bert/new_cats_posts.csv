cats,1g899c7,Community Highlight: Custom Awards!,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1g899c7/community_highlight_custom_awards/,27,"https://preview.redd.it/m22r9ybs8zvd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eefaa576394c4eca679c2cb04654724447760ef

As you may already have noticed, over the past few days our subreddit has had some exciting new awards assigned to it, tailored especially to r/cats and based on a selection of [the old custom awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/wiki/awards) you may remember!

These awards were designed especially for our community by a team of artists at reddit and are available solely in this subreddit.

We are helping to test out this new feature here and the idea is that in the future subreddit-specific awards may come with fun new features unlockable by subreddits and community participants. For now, there is a leaderboard we can unlock:

https://preview.redd.it/zq3zgpww8zvd1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=359772f1ff35ca95375a05e789375f9c0058ee26

Awarding posts and comments with one of these custom designs will of course come with a nifty little animation on your screen, just like any of the other newest version of awards.  Perhaps the best part of this new system is that these custom awards are all pretty affordable. Unlike the previous subreddit-specific awards which started at 500 coins you can now already choose to apply a custom award for 15 coins. I just think that's neat.

https://preview.redd.it/iqne6svz8zvd1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce9212d5760c6dfbb96da19465b9165d2f5a2cf

At r/Cats we are pretty excited to be a part of this trial program. Giving subreddits access to individual customisation shows that we are a unique community with its own space on reddit. You now have the choice  to award a post or comment that you think is extra-special with a design especially created for us.

Thank you to reddit admin u/SmEllen_Fresh who was our contact during the development stage and all the other reddit admins part of the dev team for this new feature!

We hope you all will enjoy this new option as much as we do.

From all of us at r/Cats, thank you for making this subreddit the special place that it is!",2024-10-20 21:14:00
cats,1gq18gy,I witnessed a cat being dumped today.,38669,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq18gy,2089,"I stopped by my sister‚Äôs house after my son‚Äôs early hockey practice. I got out and saw a blue truck pull up, they got out and put a cat down in the street. It really didn‚Äôt click what was going on at first so I went inside, then came back to my car and the truck was gone. The cat was just sitting there looking confused. I just went with my gut and ripped out of there, got a picture of the cat quickly then raced a few blocks to get a picture of the truck. I posted it to a local facebook group and contacted the police. The cat was recovered safely and the owner of the truck was identified and a warrant has been issued.

cats,1gq6tw8,My family makes fun of him because of his ears so please tell him he‚Äôs the cutest patootie in the whole world ,4884,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq6tw8,254,"Meet my cat, Sheriff ü•π

He was abandoned as a baby, so my boyfriend and I took him in. Who could leave this adorable little guy?! Anyway, I‚Äôm partially glad it happened, because now he‚Äôs ours and I love him more than anything in the whole world ü•∞ My parents and sisters always laugh at any pictures I send of him and say he‚Äôs super funny looking, but I disagree. He is the most adorable kitty and no one could tell me otherwise. I think he‚Äôs an American curl x chartreuse, but I could be wrong. 

He‚Äôs so cuddly and precious, loves to play fetch and go on walks, constantly needs attention, and is super friendly with everyone when I bring him to work with me at the office. He‚Äôs also VERY active, a little too much so, because he constantly screams at us to throw his little jingly ball so he can zoom across the apartment and retrieve it for us. He also wakes us up at 7 am every day screaming for attention, seriously we don‚Äôt even need an alarm clock when we have this little boy. He‚Äôs almost two and I can‚Äôt seem to discipline him before it‚Äôs too late, but he always comes to cuddle at the end of the night so that makes it all okay ü•π 

We‚Äôre taking him to the vet tomorrow in case the screaming is an underlying issue, but I think he‚Äôs just an attention seeking little baby. I guess I‚Äôm just a little worried because it would kill me to know my kitty is in pain. But I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs fine since he‚Äôs as active as a pea on a griddle. Anyway, sorry about the long post, but thanks for reading! ",2024-11-13 06:36:00

After some ruckus with the existing resident he-cat she made it her home. She was in bad shape but extremely determined. We took her in and got her back to health. Each morning when I was there (weekends mostly) she'd hop with her funny hopping to me, made sure we were still friends (a weak meow, a headbutt, some scritches) then go about her business. Each morning without exception. Made my day each time.

She got pregnant and, at the end of July, gave birth to four kittens. At 7 days I got a phone call she was missing. Dumped everything, got into the car, drove 1 1/2 hours just to find out she was killed by some stray dogs.

We raised the kittens on formula, love and tears; weekdays, when we couldn't be there, my MIL would summon a friend of hers to take over. Got them to not only live, but thrive. Vet, kitten food, lots of play and pets... and love. They're ours, all 4 of them, and not going anywhere. They're love fluffballs on their own, but also the legacy Pepe left for us. So we honor her by loving and raising Bijou, Marco, Teddy and Pepita.

cats,1gq1u9f,I wish cat haters would stfu about how much they hate cats,80,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq1u9f,6,"Cat tax: Archie the free-roaming cat who sometimes visits us at work

We just had a staff meeting and one of the girls would not shut up about how Archie followed her when she was leaving yesterday and she was so creeped out. My manager said he just wanted a pat, he‚Äôs really friendly, and my co-worker just kept going on about how she hates cats and wanted him to keep away from her. 

Let‚Äôs normalise shutting up about hating cats. You would never hear a dog hater admitting they hate dogs because the backlash would be swift and extreme, so let‚Äôs start the same reaction for cat haters. 

Anyone who hates cats does so out of unfounded prejudice. On very, very rare occasions, people may be justified in their hatred if they, their faintly, or small pets were harmed by a cat, but mostly it‚Äôs just people hating cats for no reason other than they‚Äôve simply never spent time around them. Because if you‚Äôve spent even 10 minutes in the company of a friendly cat, you‚Äôll know they‚Äôre sweet, affectionate, cuddly, adorable little companions. 

I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir here, but I‚Äôm just so frustrated. Every time cats get brought up in the office this one woman just goes on and on about how she hates cats. 

As for Archie, I posted the pics on our local community noticeboard on Facebook and chatted with his owner to make sure he has a home to go to. I get very nervous about him being a free-roaming cat because there‚Äôs a very busy car park between his home and the community garden behind my office where he likes to visit, chase bugs, and lounge in the sun.

Rossi is my girlfriend cat she had since she was 15, she been with her more than half her life. I've ended up living with her after we started dating. She lived with me and after we both we homeless for a couple of weeks til we found a place to live. She been with her the whole time we went thru that. Now fast-forward couple of years in 2019 before COVID, she was diagnosed as being diabetic. Been on insulin shots and pills on and off with occasional uti. At the end of August, she had 3 seizures when I got from work and we both thought it was her time then, she made to the vet and got some more pills for it. Since after then she becomes more weak and her age started to get to her (arthritis, possible kidney disease). She couldn't climb onto things like she used to. My girlfriend got injured at work and hasn't work since October, as it was a blessing in disguise as she can send more time at home with Rossi. At this point, everything has been done for rossi as we all took account her age, her breed, and how she been diabetic for years now, and in November she started to get mouth sores and drooling a lot more and having days not using the litter, she ended up using the litter and look like she was coming around. About three days before nov 11, she started not being able to walk on her own, laying only on her sides,  not able to sit. Started not to eat and drink water. We knew her time was coming and wasn't the same she was before. At 920 am nov 11, she passed away in my girlfriend arms with me holding on to her paws. I wanted to post this to say. Life is very unpredictable, can be short or as lucky we got with her, long. I want to say hold your fur baby tight, do everything you can to show them your love. I just couldn't believe she left us so fast. I am happy to send the last days with her, helping her use the litter, but I knew she is in a happy place now where she can be her crazy self and know she is watching over us now. RIP Rossi. I will always love you and will see you again...I miss you so much my baby, our boss, our other half. It's amazing how animals, cats especially can grow so attach to you..I love you Rossi forever march 2005 - november 2024",2024-11-13 11:46:08

cats,1gq9fph,How to make my cat less stressed out,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq9fph,0,"Hello fellow cat lovers !

Here's the thing, I've got two cats at home, one is fine by himself for the day, the other one completely panics whenever I leave even for 10 minutes. I usually am at home all the time (I can't work, so I take care of our chickens and rabbits, food, garden, laundry...) but I have to leave for 2 days in december because I have tests to run at the hospital. Sekhmet (my husband thought he was a girl, so that's his name) is gonna flip. My husband and daughter are at home morning and afternoon (they'll leave only from 8 to 17, and I'll be there morning first day, and afternoon the third) but he'll try to follow my husband when he leaves and he cries and it's just awful. 

So my question is, do you have any idea how to help our little boy accept the alone time (since Merry will be completely fine, he'll just be super happy when the family gets home) ? They'll be outside while nobody's home, but they have free access to the hay filled garage and the warm greenhouse, they just won't have their loyal servant (myself) to open the door whenever they want to move (they're very spoiled). What scares me the most is that he might try to follow my husband to work.

So here's a picture of my cuties, and 2 more of Sekhmet ! (Merry either rolls into a cinnamon roll, eats, or leaves, so it's hard to have pictures of him, Sekhmet is like glue)",2024-11-13 09:53:07

For example, he can be loving on you one second, purring and making biscuits, then the next second he is biting (way too hard) and clawing to the point of drawing blood. Another example is while we are just walking around our home he will block us out of an area by standing in the way, daring us to try to get past.

I always found the little garden birds (Robins etc) hard, you don't want to touch them in case you mangle them even worse and I have miscalculated and pulled heads off twice, but I have noticed Starlings will do anything to avoid you finishing the job, they have no legs when I see them so they just sort of roll with their wings on the floor.

Only one cat is having the stool issue, and she has been dealing with it pretty much the entire time i‚Äôve had her. They weren‚Äôt bloody until she was maybe 1-1.5 years old, but they were always soft and foul smelling before that too.

She was born in a shelter & they kept records so I know that she and others in her litter had coccidia and were treated for it. The vet that took care of them at the shelter noted that she had soft and foul smelling stools when i‚Äôd take her for checkups, but i told her they were always like that, so i believe she ruled out the coccidia being present again. 

I started taking her to a different vet and at this point the stools were also bloody; they did fecal tests and they were negative for anything (and my other cat doesn‚Äôt have these issues at all despite sharing litter boxes so they definitely ruled out anything that could be contagious). They told me that she was likely stressed and it should resolve, but it never has; i wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs gotten worse, but it hasn‚Äôt gotten better and it‚Äôs been 2 years of this. When i brought it up at their checkup earlier this year, they still didn‚Äôt seem concerned.

She doesn‚Äôt act lethargic or anything and she seems to eat/drink & play normally. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related, but she does regurgitate food often and she‚Äôs done this since she was younger also.

Has anyone else ever seen this before? Possibly a form of ibs or other gastrointestinal problem? I will press it more next time we go to the vet, but I don‚Äôt know what all they can do considering they already did fecal tests and she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúact‚Äù sick so they don‚Äôt feel pressed to figure out what could be wrong.

It seems something unnatural, making of them some silly clowns for our own amusement and nothing else.

Am I missing something? Do cats truly enjoy to be trained and I'm totally wrong and biased here? What's your view, and experience if you train your cat?

Sasha was a sweetheart and sooo adorable, but unfortunately my cat would attack her and get all depressed. She even stop eating.

I did tell my mother that the bonding would take a lot of time as she expected the cats to adapt in a single month, which is stupid considering that our Siamese has been living with us alone for 10 years.

Anyways. We were able to give her away to new owners who would be able to take much better care of her that we would've ever been able to.

my cat won't eat. it's been about 48 hours--hard to tell because i work 12 hour shifts, and was at work when she stopped.

she has pooped (small amount, but perfectly normal poop). yesterday she threw up clear vomit twice, but nothing since. she has had about 2 pieces of the 'dreamies' cat treats since we came home from the vet today, and the vet did give her IV fluids.

prior to our vet visit today, she was drinking water. right now she is not.

two years ago she had very serious intestine obstruction and ended up in surgery, losing a piece of her intestine in the process. she is acting somewhat similarly now as she did back then, with two exceptions: no lethargy this time around, and she's pooping.

her symptoms aside from not eating & the clear vomit: hiding, smacking her lips. vet said she was slightly dehydrated but she won't drink.

as mentioned, we've been to the vet. her blood test came back fine, vet checked her and said she feels bloated, gave her some anti-nausea and other meds but they evidently didn't work, as she's not eating still.

this vet CANNOT give her a scan to detect if there's an obstruction for another few days as they do not have a radiologist on hand, and i am horrified and i feel helpless. i cannot go through that whole not eating-surgery-recovery thing with her again, it was the most traumatizing week of my life. but more than that i just don't want my girl to die.

could it be an obstruction despite her pooping? is she constipated? has someone had similar experiences?

what do i do.

advice and any words of comfort appreciated, please, because i have been SPIRALLING for the past 12 hours and i can't do this anymore.",2024-11-13 00:05:51

The funniest thing is , now every cat in the street seems like a friend to me , I'm petting them left and right , always carrying treats with me , and the neighbourhood 's cats just know to follow me when I walk by , it's insane how such a small creature can just change your life like that.
Sometimes I just get this dreadful thought that a cat's life is awfully short and it just destroys me , I'm doing my best to keep him healthy and happy and I really wish he'd outlive me because I will NOT be okay if he leaves before me.

I eventually convinced my housemates to let her move in, and she has now been with us a whole year.
When she moved in, she did this thing where she would yank chunks of her fur out, causing the bald patches in the first 2 photos. She can still do that a little on occasion, but nowhere near to the same extent, and I've not spotted a bald patch on her for a while.
You can also see in the old photos how much dirtier she is, especially her feet. Now they're pristine white and she's looking cleaner and healthier.

I checked my terrace every hour and minute then I made a sound I usually made to call him home, but he didn't appear like he usually would appear from on top of my car, like literally no sight of him. My sister has looked around the neighbourhood too, she couldn't find him, it's like no trace of him.

For background, he was once a stray cat, my sister picked the wrong cat, it supposed to be another stray cat, but my family kept him anyway. I've lost a cat before too, it was a domestic cat, she died few years ago that I assumed she was attacked by some animal. It was actually my fault for immaturity, stupidity, and neglience. It was a very traumatic experience to lose her and now I am experienced the same loss, the thing that is different is that I can't even remember the exact last moment I had with Kuma, I am so afraid if the last moment I had with him was bad because sometimes I did the same thing (pushing my cats away when I wanted some space alone).

I couldn't stop thinking about him, the good and the bad I had with him, I've tried different things to cope, from stop thinking, stop blaming myself to blaming myself, all I could think about is his face and voice. I couldn't stop worrying if he's cold, if he has food, if he has a shelter, if he's safe, it's driving me crazy. I don't know why he ran away, is he unhappy? Is he sad? Because my mother could be so angry and so mad if he stole the foods (he has his own food, we given him dry food). I was scared that my mother hurted him when I was asleep when he made a mess, my mother claimed she didn't hurt him, she said he was still seen in the afternoon. I regretted that I didn't check on him because I was too sleepy to check, and the moment I woke up, he was gone... Maybe I deserve it? For the pain from losing him... For again my immaturity and neglience... I don't know any way more to cope...",2024-11-13 00:18:15

My 15 year old boy Anakin recently started having difficulty walking and with balance, to such a degree that my partner and I scheduled an appointment with our vet to get him checked  out; we can't afford an MRI but our vet coincidentally has a lot of experience and after testing eye reflexes and checking his ears and everything else, the vet told us that Cancer was a very high concern on her list and that we should start planning for the worst. It was a gut punch to say the least, I don't think I've cried so much in my life before and truthfully I don't think I ever will again. He is the sweetest boy I've ever known and he truly is my best friend. 

All this to say that we've started him on steroid therapy with the hope that it gives him some semblance of comfort and he can live out his last days to the best that he possibly can. Granted this is day 2 of him being on medication, but my partner works from home and let me know that he spent a majority of his time under the couch today, much like he did yesterday; this isn't like him and I totally understand his perspective, he surely feels most comfortable under there and I can only imagine how confused and afraid he surely must be. My main concern is that I'm doing right by him. He deserves nothing but the best and I want to make sure I'm not hurting him or prolonging any kind of suffering. Is there a way to tell if he's miserable? Is him being under our couch enough of a sign? I'm so torn, this is all so sudden and I'm just totally unsure of everything. It's going to be the worst day of my life when we make that decision to put him at rest, and fuck I don't want to do it before he's ready but I also don't want him to hurt and be scared for weeks on end before letting him go. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if this is a long rambling post, I'm not the best writer.",2024-11-12 23:31:37

We caught it before being worse, he doesn't puke and goes to his litter box without problem, he doesn't want to eat or drink, but me and my son are doing our best to keep him hydrated and at least giving him humid food, but I'm still very scared. 

Do you think there's a chance for him? Even if it's the worst result, I would like to know and be prepared, and trying to give him the best in my possibilities. He deserves it. ",2024-11-12 22:57:37

cats,1gptcrz,New kitten wants to play with older cat so bad,5,https://v.redd.it/vu5h683ywi0e1,1,"
Older cat is about 4 years old. When we got the older cat, we got him and another cat as kittens. They were bonded like brothers and loved each other until one day one of the older cats began barfing and then ran away and never came back. The older cat was alone for about 3 months until we recently got the new guy. First two days were hissing from the older cat, and now he‚Äôs becoming more passive and generally disinterested. 

The new kitten came from a home of like 14 cats, 4 of them being adults, so all he wants to do is be close to / interact with another cat. The older cat is not afraid of him anymore, and lets the kitten get close but then makes weird growling sounds and then gets up and leaves. 

There‚Äôs been a couple instances so far where the older cat will let the kitten smell his face, and then the older cat smells him but then does some variation of a growl sound and the kitten immediately backs off.

Anyway to make these guys like each other? The video attached is what the kitten keeps doing, including playfully trying to mount him and play. The older cat keeps his back turned to him and doesn‚Äôt mind until the kitten gets really close.

cats,1gpv22h,Won‚Äôt stop chewing wires ,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpv22h/wont_stop_chewing_wires/,0,"
Hi all, 

My cat won‚Äôt stop chewing on wires. We‚Äôve tried putting vaporub and bitter sprays on them, but she remains determined. We know she hates the smell and taste of it because she‚Äôll flinch away and wrinkle her nose, but she decides it‚Äôs worth it to chew them anyway. 

She has all kinds of toys, including various rope toys and silvervine sticks made for chewing, but she has no interest in them whatsoever. On that note, she is completely unaffected in catnip, silvervine, and gall fruit. 

We tried to train her to chew on her toys using treats, but she only bites them if she sees the treat in our hand. Otherwise they‚Äôre left completely abandoned. When she chews on cords we take them from her and always offer her another option, but she never takes it. She also absolutely knows she‚Äôs not supposed to be chewing on cords. When she thinks we‚Äôre not paying attention she stalks up to them, and when we call out her name she gets irritated but leaves them alone until we‚Äôre not looking anymore. 

The only toys she has interest in chewing on is plastic string toys (that look like cords), and I would be fine with that if she didn‚Äôt apparently have the jaws of an alligator. She chews through them in 5 minutes and swallows the smaller pieces. 

I know cats need to chew, just like cats need to scratch, but I can‚Äôt get her to chew on anything that isn‚Äôt food or cords. Even with toys, she doesn‚Äôt play with them at all unless they‚Äôre moving, and she only uses her claws. 

We‚Äôve put all our cords in cord protectors, and she‚Äôs hellbent on chewing those too. So far none of our cords are damaged, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time before she hurts herself. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

He is also very attached to me and baby so I don't have the heart to shut him out at night. The nights I have done that I've opened the door to find he's pushed right up against it. I got him when I was pregnant and we always napped together when he was a scared kitten of only 12 weeks. He's been obsessed with my son when he was born. 

He is so tolerant of my son now he is a grabby toddler and he always keeps an eye on him. I might post more Teddy and toddler shenanigans because they melt my heart together.

But since I put the harness on him 3 days ago he's basically been moping around and not playing. In fact, he's mostly been hiding.

Am I traumatizing him by keeping him in it? Is this a normal reaction to a harness? Is 8 too old to train him for harnesses and leashes?

The last couple times we gave this a shot, I caved and took the harness off after a few hours but a friend of mine who takes his cats on camping trips said to give it 2 weeks... But I don't want my boy to be miserable and it's not like him to not be playful.

cats,1gq2kfj,Kittens and adult cats have been visiting my house this whole year.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gq2kfj/kittens_and_adult_cats_have_been_visiting_my/,0,"Hello there! I've been living in my new apartment for about a year now and I noticed that there's a lot of cats visiting my apartment and sleeping here for a night or two then leave but they'd come back from time to time. All in all, I think 5 different kittens (3 with moms) have been visiting me and three adult cats (including the three kitten's mom). By the way, the two kittens are now adopted by my neighbors. I just asked if they wanted a kitten and they took them in, two seperate families but they still visit me from time to time to dine and dash, haha!

Man, I get so weak when a random cat rubs themself on me. There was this cat earlier (didn't visit my house but very close to my house) I was buying eggs for breakfast when this cat was rubbing herself on me. So, I rushed home before I could get the egg. I was cramming to find a bowl or two to feed the cat. Since I've had multiple visits, I bought a couple of food. Stockpiling dry and wet, plus some treats. I think I need to buy some toys. I can't really own a cat because of the state of my home plus my brother would yell at me. I tried keeping one kitten but when my brother saw her poopsies, he told me to get rid of the cat since I'm not cleaning it when I just literally woke up and about to clean it. (I'm so sorry, I can't really afford buying cat litter for now but when I feel like the cat is about to do her business, I'd pick her up and take her to the bathroom and she actually does her business in there) 

Anyways, she was so hungry but I think the store I bought the eggs from owns the cat, they call her Kuro or something. I need to ask because I feel like they do own the cat since they gave her a name or maybe, the cat just likes hanging out at their crib.

I need some advise on what else to get since I get regular visits. I don't wanna be empty handed when they come around. I'm just so broke right now. Man, I could only afford two eggs. üòÇ But I think I have some to spare after paying the rent, I'm not too sure. Maybe there's a goodwill over here where I can buy cheap cat toys? Or like a shelter where I can get discounted food? Oh, I'm not too sure about goodwill, I live in the Philippines so, I guess we don't have that. 

Also, do you guys have an advise as to what I could get as an alternative to cat litter? I can't really afford the actual litter made for cats, but maybe I have a cheaper alternative? I do have some tubs here I use to wash my clothes with, I just don't know where to get the litter. I apologize for the broken English, it's not really my first language. I hope you guys can help me, I'm so sorry if this was super confusing. Thank you!",2024-11-13 02:30:10

cats,1gpx3va,"I‚Äôm thinking our newly adopted cat is not the right fit, but I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm missing. Please help. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpx3va/im_thinking_our_newly_adopted_cat_is_not_the/,2,"Hi there - long time lurker. I‚Äôm not sure how to start this. 

I recently lost my Maine Coone some months ago. It was heartbreaking. He was 17 and I adopted him when he was 10. We spent 7 glorious years together. Ever since he passed away, I‚Äôd been feeling a hole in my heart.

About a month or so ago I adopted an orange kitty from the shelter. He‚Äôs about 5 months old now. They told us he was calm and gentle - and of course, I had known at some point he would open up and his true personality would show. He reminded me of a kitty I had growing up - Milo. 

However, I‚Äôm starting to wonder now about that decision. He‚Äôs only, really, a baby. He‚Äôs still learning and growing. But to be completely honest, he‚Äôs become sort of a terror. 


I had gotten a cat that was younger in hopes it could comfort my beagle in some capacity. She lost her best friend when my cat passed away. She loves cats. So much so, she won‚Äôt ever stand up for herself. She was so excited to meet him. Ricky, the new kitty, attacks her and does drive-bys. She won‚Äôt do anything. She just takes it. At one point, he made he cry and another time, I saw her trying to get away from him. Literally running and looking behind her. 

I have a GSD as well. She‚Äôs also been with cats throughout her life. But where she never felt the need to watch one like a hawk before, she does now. If he‚Äôs doing something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù - which he typically seems to be, she thinks she‚Äôs helping me by solving that. But really it‚Äôs chaotic because he‚Äôs antagonizing her and running, and she‚Äôs tirelessly watching his next move because he‚Äôs constantly in something. 

He doesn‚Äôt appear to be afraid at all. He does seem to egg them on and antagonize them to a point where it doesn‚Äôt seem like play much anymore. Im honestly worried he might get them in the eye one time. 

Every night, he‚Äôs running around, meowing his head off, getting into things consistently so much so that we have to check what he‚Äôs doing. He‚Äôs climbing on shelves, tearing up the carpet, climbing along my chair, trying to get under the stove. He‚Äôs dented a shelf my husband built because he climbed to the very top and started knocking metal things over. It‚Äôs like a constant checking and see what he‚Äôs doing and trying to show him‚Äùno‚Äù but of course, that doesn‚Äôt work. If I‚Äôm offering his dinner, because every night the girls get a bit of chicken or some other protein with their meals, he will actually grab the plate away from me with his claws and knock it over. If I‚Äôm working, as I WFH, he‚Äôs constantly on my lap, biting me, running away. He‚Äôs tried running up the walls, the moldings. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do and it‚Äôs become stressful. I feel absolutely terrible feeling this way because I made a promise to him and I‚Äôve never, ever thought about returning any animals before. Part of me feels it‚Äôs irresponsible - what did I think was going to happen with adopting a younger cat? But to be perfectly honest, I‚Äôve never had a cat act this way. I‚Äôm hoping it calms but it‚Äôs honestly been stressful each and every night for a month. He‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous, he can be so sweet - I can‚Äôt stand the thought of him wondering what happened. Or to see him again after I put him back there. But I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do and the other part of me feels like he needs a home where he can be his genuine self and accepted. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. If you can help it, please, no mean comments. I‚Äôm looking for advice and I‚Äôm genuinely trying. My husband says we didn‚Äôt know what we were getting, we didn‚Äôt know the unknown, but my heart can‚Äôt take much more heartache. I don‚Äôt want to abandon him, I don‚Äôt want him to hurt, but I am having such a hard time and have since the beginning. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best for everyone, or if there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not thinking of that could aid in this.

cats,1gq1hqg,Weird dilemma with my cat ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gq1hqg/weird_dilemma_with_my_cat/,0,"Hi everyone! 

I was fostering a cat for about a month and he was really sweet so I decided to just adopt him. He‚Äôs my first ever cat and for the time I‚Äôve had him he‚Äôs been nothing but a sweet, very playful and cuddly boy. 

Now recently he learned where the door to outside is and he started meowing to go out constantly. Like literally any time he‚Äôs awake he‚Äôll spend long amounts of time at the door meowing. 

I am NOT going to let him be an outdoor cat. So I bought a cat harness and leash. Obviously he didn‚Äôt love it at first but once I got it on him we could go outside at least and just walk around the yard because we live in a quiet enough neighborhood. However, after a couple times outside he started to try and jump away and come loose from his harness. (He did it once somehow and I think since then he knows he can get off if he tries hard enough.) 

So when he starts to do that then I pick him up and head inside. Inside I never have an issue picking him up. But when we are out and I pick him up to bring him inside, he starts to growl at me a little. Not hiss or claw or bite but he makes that low growl and tries to escape my arms. I know he wants to stay outside but 1 it‚Äôs freezing and 2 he tries to get out of his harness every couple of minutes. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if I should ignore his urges to go outside or if I should keep trying to get him used to his harness. My biggest fear is him running away and yes I know cats are smart but I really don‚Äôt even want to worry about it. 

I don‚Äôt know much about his last owner but maybe he used to be an outdoor cat. He has lots of stuff inside here and I play with him all the time. The house is big with 3 floors for him to roam around so I just don‚Äôt know why he needs to go outside so bad. 

(I‚Äôm having a whole other issue with him peeing on the rug even though he poops in his litter box -don‚Äôt know if this could have any sort of connection) ",2024-11-13 01:36:22

I live in student housing in a country where outdoor cats are common and very much the norm. Last week, a young cat showed up in front of our dorm, it was very friendly and meowed loudly. I figured it was cold, sat down on a bench, put it on my lap and after about half an hour I took the cat to a residential area near us, where I assume the cat's owners live.



It has returned every evening since then and we got into a bit of a routine - we cuddle, we walk together to the residential area, the cat runs into a garden, I go back.



Today, as I was sitting outside, a girl approached me and asked me if I was worried about fleas and illnesses - I wasn't until now.

  
The cat seems completely healthy and isn't underweight, it's also very friendly, so clearly used to people. I don't know exactly who it belongs to. But I'm now worried if I could potentially get fleas or something.

I have two cats, Angus and Finley. Angus is a bit of a wall flower cat, he tends to hide up in my office and sometimes gets to my bedroom, only getting out for food or for a walk (he loves being outside). I recently found an old blanket of his and placed in the living room to give him a place here and it has helped to get him out of my office.
Now I had the idea to lock the door of the living room after they both had dinner, so both my cats and me would be in the living room, to encourage Angus to sit elsewhere than the office and to also feel more comfortable in the living room. I'm testing that out right now and he isn't hiding away, but he does keep an eye on my other cat. 
Finley is kind of a dominant cat and has the tendency to jump Angus. I don't think it's him fighting and more wanting to play, but Angus very clearly often isn't in the mood for it and will hiss at him and either Finley will back off, or Angus runs away upstairs. 
They're currently calmly sitting in their own corners of the living room and about to doze off, so it seems fine but I'm wondering if this could eventually have the opposite effect with them being more antagonistic to each other.

Does this sound right?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gq07p0/cat_fell_from_4th_story_does_this_sound_right/,4,"I'm posting on behalf of my friend who lives on the 4th floor and they have a balcony. They're currently traveling, and live with roommates. 

Apparently, the cat fell from the 4th floor balcony to the ground, ruptured their hip sockets, broke their hind legs and ankles, spinal fracture and hernia, broken tail, potential liver rupture and potential internal bleeding.

I googled about this and Google AI, plus a fee other websites stated a cat can fall from 4 floors and be relatively unscathed. I know very little about cats so I'm none the wiser. 

Does the amount of injuries sound legitimate?",2024-11-13 00:34:41
cats,1gprtih,Best treatment for anxious kitties?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gprtih/best_treatment_for_anxious_kitties/,4,"We have a cat who overgrooms because of anxiety. It started when we moved houses across the country, at first the vet said it was allergies but then we moved again to a different state which does not have any of the same allergens and the over grooming continued. That's when it was figured out it was likely anxiety. She has licked her belly bald and it's causing her to have hairballs pretty frequently. So I'm looking for some sort of calming supplement or something we can do to help her feel more relaxed and safe in her home. She's also aggressive with our other two cats which I'm assuming is also due to her anxiety. We cannot use feliway or any product like that as one of our other cats is very sensitive to it, and it's almost killed her before. It makes her vomit profusely and stop eating / drinking which is very dangerous. So it cannot be a plugin. As far as modifications we have made to help with anxiety, our anxious kitty has a gate that we lock at night so she has two bedrooms and a bathroom separate from the other two so she can relax. We sometimes leave it closed a bit during the day as well until she meows letting us know she wants it open. We also have a huge cardboard box that we have modified with a door cut into it, covered by a blanket and filled with soft blankets so she has a safe little fort to go into which she seems to love. 

Anxious kitty is pretty picky when it comes to food, so anything that comes in treat form may not be a hit unless it's really tasty. If I can mix it in with wet food she might eat it, but at this point I'm willing to try anything. Next option would be getting the vet to prescribe her Prozac which I would prefer to avoid, if possible. Thanks for any advice!",2024-11-12 18:35:39

cats,1gpovis,Teaching how to play,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpovis/teaching_how_to_play/,5,"Good morning! This may seem like a bit of a dumb question, but I'm genuinely at a loss for what to do. How do I teach my cat to play?

For context, I am a college student who lives in a dorm and adopted a pretty young cat in September. I'm not sure his exact age, but he must be very close to a year or a little over by now. Me and my roommates adopted him from another student, as they often mistreated him (no water, food, dirty litter, etc). He was also previously a street cat before this. 

He has learned a ton of bad habits from his previous owners and time on the street. He is so food aggressive and begs for food despite having  eaten. He steals food often and will lick dirty plates clean just for a taste. I've more or less learned to deal with this by putting the trash can where he can't reach it and ensuring plates in the sink are clean. 

My main concern however, is how he's learned to play. Everyone who used to play with him in the past did so very roughly. As such, he learned that biting was the only correct way to play. He would bite others to initiate playtime and to actually play. 

I've gotten him a bit out of this habit, and he does it much less but I can't break it entirely as my roommates play rough with him occasionally and don't get the importance of not doing so until he learns better. My main concern is that any alternative I've tried to implement, he lacks interest in. 

He will play with a string toy for about 5 mins max before sitting down and just staring at it. And he'll only play with it at that when the person carrying it runs around and he has to catch it. 

He will play with a ball only when someone throws it. He'll chase after it then sit there and stare at it and will continue to do so unless someone throws it again. 

The result of this has been that he's horrible at night time. When I first adopted him, he would cuddle me through the night and sleep all night. Now however, he sleeps for a bit and then gets up around 2-4am with insane energy and clearly bored. 

There's been no change to his routine otherwise. So I'm a bit at a loss for what I can do with him. I feel horrible as I want to make sure he's getting the physical and mental stimulation he needs (and resulting lets me sleep).

I have a black cat and a white cat.

I took the white cat to the vet for a belly issue. He stayed at the clinic for the night, and he is better now.

But since we came back, the white cat is avoiding and hissing the black cat. They are best friends, they really like each other, so I am not understanding this new behavior. 

The black cat is behaving well, we gets close to the white cat as usual, he tries to play but then the white cat either runs away from the black cat, or hisses. 

The black cat is 7 months old, and the white cat is 3 years old. Funny thing is, the white cat is twice as big as the black cat.

*Mama cat is a wild cat. We brought her along when moving from Millidgeville, GA. We kept her inside, but she was howling and acting a little nuts...We let her outside, and she was gone for 2 weeks. She came back sweeter than ever, and has been our sweet feline friend ever since! (Yes, she is fixed)* 

My mama cat is very old. Old and sweet. AND NOT TO MENTION: skinny! I give her food twice a day: One cup of Meow Mix (wet food) and she gets kibbles too, at like 3ish. And I give her water. So why is she skinny? Here is where the gray cat comes in. The gray cat is a beautiful boy. There is only one problem: When he hears that food going in her bowl, its the Battle of the Foods. (Actually, he's the only one that does any fighting. Mama cat just lays on the ground on screams for the hooman to come save her.) I bought her a cat house to sleep and hide in, and she does, but he goes in there and fights her! (I've also caught Mama Cat sitting to the side, letting him eat her food to avoid injury.) One time, Mama Cat had one of her eyes slapped out from her gruesome battles.

Anyways,  I could tell Gray was neutered. He was fat, so I knew he got fed. I tried calling him over to befriend him. He looked like he wanted to come, but remembered me, and to stay off that porch. I contacted the neighborhood board, showing pictures of Gray and some blood splatters from his battles with my Mama. I did NOT blame the owners!! At the top, I said ""Animals are hard to control! It is not  your fault. You might not know he was doing this. You might have thought he was being a sweet kitty!"" No one responded to it, but yesterday, someone put a note on it saying they got rid of him!! üòø Now, I'm worried. Did they put him to sleep? Did they put him in the pound?

I was walking my cat around, and he got spooked and went off into the forest where I couldn‚Äôt follow. He wouldn‚Äôt come back when I called.

I‚Äôm heartbroken cuz I feel like I‚Äôll probably never see him again. I keep getting told he‚Äôll come back because this is where the food is, but I‚Äôm not sure. What are the chances he comes back, considering he‚Äôs not used to the area or other animals? What should I do?",2024-11-12 18:31:53

His FHV causes chronic upper respiratory infections about every other month or so. My vet usually gives him an injectable antibiotic and a steroid, and he clears right up within a couple days and stays healthy for about 2 months. But his congestion always comes back. He takes Methimazole twice a day for the hyperthyroidism, plus Lysine twice per week and a daily allergy treat supplement to help his immune system (though the lysine and supplement don‚Äôt seem to help at all).

Despite his congestion, he very active, affectionate, and has a healthy appetite. I feel horrible listening to his stuffy nose while he sleeps and seeing his runny eyes. It‚Äôs also gross when he sneezes right in my face multiple times a day üòê

My question is - is there an alternative to the regular antibiotic? At some point I assume he will stop responding to it once he builds resistance. It‚Äôs also very costly to take him to the vet every other month for the meds and the office visit fee.

Our most recent kitten, Jerry, is 6 months old. We got him when he was 8 weeks old, and he used the litter box fine for a few months. Then he started going outside the litter box but near it, which then escalated to him going on the rug, and now he's also going in the bathtub. He's not spraying because it's on the flat ground, and he's also pooping. 

- He's neutered so I don't think it's a marking issue. 

- We've taken him to the vet to rule out infections and health issues. 

- We've tried using different types of litter and different styles of litter boxes. We have 7 litter boxes in multiple rooms throughout the house. 

- The other cats are not bullying him around the litter box. The kitten is the most aggressive and playful one, so i know he's not afraid of a territorial issue. 

These are the only things that I've read about when I try to research this issue, but none of them seem to be the answer. I cannot for the life of me figure out what his issue is, but I am seriously considering rehoming him if this isn't solved. ",2024-11-12 15:08:31

cats,1gp3xzz,Queen mother cat and her kitties,72,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gp3xzz,3,"Let me tell you this lovely girls story. She unfortunately had a rough start in life. As a small kitten herself, she was in the hands of a neighbor that is known for abusing/neglecting animals, hell, even her own children. This person had a reputation of somehow getting ahold of small kittens and keeping them around when they are small and ‚Äúcute‚Äù (we all know the kind of people who do this kind of harmful cruel behavior). She would throw them out either in the middle of winter, or in a fit of rage. The person I‚Äôm referring to has mental health problems, schizophrenia I believe, and she‚Äôs also has substance abuse problems. This does not justify the behavior in my opinion.. I will not and cannot sympathize because the person is unwilling to help herself and she‚Äôs been offered help on numerous occasions, and unfortunately, anyone who is around this person that cannot defend themselves, ends up paying the consequences. Animals and children. I watched it go on for months and months, meanwhile i did EVERYTHING in my power to get these animals away from her, and get the APL involved. I got absolutely nowhere. I don‚Äôt know how many animals that have died and suffered in this persons hands but I made sure that this cat would never have to deal with it AGAIN. 

This mama cat right here‚Ä¶ I rescued her and her 4 newborn kittens.. I‚Äôve seen her around many times in the area near my house, I tried to pet her a few times and feed her, but she was always stand offish, she would hiss at anyone that came near her.. so I respected that and admired her from afar just making sure she was okay when she was around. she was emaciated, flea insfested, breast feeding, in a neighborhood that is overpopulated with strays. The person who is responsible for more than a handful of litters is a neighbor who would keep kittens and then throw them out as adults in the middle of winter.. she did this on more than one occasion and I tried to get some legal help but unfortunately got nowhere. I wanted to make sure that this person didn‚Äôt spot this litter of kittens because this poor mother unfortunately was in the hands of this awful person as a kitten herself and was heartlessly thrown out during a blizzard. I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt her first set of kittens. But I will make sure it‚Äôs her last. If I wouldn‚Äôt have took her in she more than likely would have already been pregnant again. I know for a fact this woman abused the cats, I‚Äôve listened to it and seen many things over the years. She never let me come near her in the past (the cat)however, a few weeks ago, I was sitting on my porch and mama cat comes up to the steps of my porch and she looked very frantic, I got close to her and she would back off a bit but not run away, I figured she was just hungry , I went to my kitchen and brought a big bowl of food and water, I couldn‚Äôt believe the amount of food she ate within minutes, like if she never ate in her life.. later that night I saw her again, and she was meowing loudly while walking, kinda signaling me to follow her.. and there I found her 4 kittens‚Ä¶I knew I had to do something but I didn‚Äôt think it was going to be easy, trying to bring her in plus the babies.. I usually would never mess with a mother and her kittens but I felt it was 100% necessary.. to my surprise she communicated everything that she needed very clearly, as soon as I opened my house to her she made herself quickly at home and she THRIVED as a mother to her babies. She‚Äôs now flea/parasite free, Gained 3 pounds, and has a lovely shiny coat .. she she eats several times a day and she is just the best mother! Her babies are so strong, beautiful and healthy.

Our cat runs to greet him each morning and seems very happy to be around him. We‚Äôve allowed them to interact as our cat is up to date on all vaccines and is at the vet enough for check ups and all is currently well.

cats,1gpp2b6,Neighbors cat is left outside several times a week,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpp2b6/neighbors_cat_is_left_outside_several_times_a_week/,3,"Hi everyone; I have mostly come here for advice because this has been bothering me for 6 months. I‚Äôm not sure if there is anything I can do or should do rather.

One of my neighbors has a cat, we will call her Lilly, who somehow winds up outside several times a week. The first time I saw Lilly was when I was walking to our community center and she ran up to me. Not knowing the  situation I took her to the vet to check her chip. Turns out the owner of Lilly was in New York for five more days. And told me to leave her outside since her doors were locked, thus leaving Lilly with no food or access to water. Ontop of that Lilly is declawed on all 4 paws.

The next time Lilly escaped I messaged her on facebook and told her Lilly was outside again; she told me Lilly was in bed with her. Yet her husband came outside and grabbed Lilly from the road. 

After that interaction I stopped messaging Lilly‚Äôs owner. Every time I see Lilly I‚Äôm worried about her, there are several times where she has almost been hit by a car. She is missing her tail from an accident like this.

Morally I know it would be wrong to take Lilly in, but how do I get over the guilt of seeing her in harms way? Do I continue to do nothing?",2024-11-12 16:43:36

cats,1gpljqe,Why does my cat constantly go to the toilet outside the litter box?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpljqe/why_does_my_cat_constantly_go_to_the_toilet/,3,"I have a kitten about 7 months old and for the three months he has been with me he has been periodically going to the wrong place. My roommate also has a cat and he also has a tray, in general we have two trays in different places. He has no problems with this. My cat always poops in the tray, but pees quite often in absolutely any place, BUT also sometimes in the tray. When I was at the vet for another reason I was told that he could be marking territory, but then I realized that he literally just sits down and pees. A couple of times it happened on the rug in the bathroom, then on some fabric that was lying in the hallway, and right now he damn well pissed on the bag that contained the camera, even though it was on the shelf (fortunately the camera was not damaged). I assumed he didn't like the litter but I've tried three different ones and nothing has changed. I've also tried cat repellent spray but he doesn't care. I also thought he might feel discomfort, but he literally feels great all the time, I haven't noticed any changes or that he is uncomfortable going to the toilet. Although my roommate still suspects that he might be sick with something, I don't have the money for testing and castration yet, even if that could theoretically stop it, which I doubt. I hope that he is just behaving inappropriately and you can advise something about it.

I will also add: when i found him i lived in another place where there were flower pots and he shit in those pots every day (he also pooped in the litter box at the same time). I covered them with foil and it stopped. When i moved here he shit under the bathtub a few times but eventually that stopped too",2024-11-12 14:09:26

cats,1gpcgol,My shelter girl transformation,16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gpcgol,0,"I know many people have rescued cats on the brink of the death and recovered them so this isn‚Äôt that kinda situation, but I‚Äôm still so happy that I got this girl out of the shelter 2 years ago and I‚Äôm sitting her pondering about how it feels like she‚Äôs always been in my life! She adapted so quickly. I was torn between kitties to adopt but she was there for almost a year and had some dreads on her lower back :(. I think she was depressed in the shelter and either couldn‚Äôt reach or didn‚Äôt feel like grooming herself. She is a larger cat (a little chonky but also just has a large stature) so I think it is partly because the cage she was in was too small for her. 

Her name is Rizzo, which was the name she had when I adopted her but she also goes by Edie (or Edith if she‚Äôs being naughty), Tiny Timmy, Fetus, Bratilda, Tilde, Tilly, etc. 

I had another orange that passed away not long before she did while I was away at work and someone was watching him (RIP Ivan). It was devastating to come back to an empty place and not even be there for my boy during his last hours. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get another cat so soon, but when I took his unopened food to the shelter where he came from, I hung out with all the kitties for like 4-5 hours. Next time I went, I started to think I might do it. Then, I did it. Adopted Rizzo on Aug 19, 2022 and so glad I did. She‚Äôs so annoying and I love her. ",2024-11-12 04:20:21
cats,1gpj7k0,Elderly cat litter tray nightmare ,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1gpj7k0/elderly_cat_litter_tray_nightmare/,2,"I have a 20 year old cat that is now causing disgusting chaos in my house with her toilet trips.

She has kidney decline, so urinates more than usual. I use wood chip pellets to help soak up the pee with a baking soda combo and change the full litter tray daily. This is quite expensive as I get through soany bags of it, but it's the best accommodation I've managed so far. 

The issue is that she has increasingly started stepping in her poo when she's doing her covering routine with the litter, and then she proceeds to walk her poo-paws around the house. Keeping track of her poo routines and intervening before complete poo related nightmares occur is very hard, and the clean up involved is becoming a real issue.

She is a fussy eater and a grazer. She only eats wet food. She will graze a little bit of dry but next to none. This, I think, means she isn't doing the dry poo types which would prevent tracking when her paws come into contact. I'm having to wash her paws in the bath every other day when I find she's got poo on them.

I'm losing my mind with this. I've been considering alternative solutions - currently, I'm considering getting a very wide litter tray (60cm+) so she has more room for maneuverability, however given her desire to bury, I don't think this will stop her.

I'm also thinking what I can introduce to her diet show she has more solid and less squidgy trackable poo. 

Her name is Meows as she bellows whenever she wants to - a proper feeding schedule is likely to be next to impossible. She has been a grazer for 20 years and will shout to her little hearts content as she pleases if her bowl is empty. My schedule doesn't easily allow for this either. Preempting this as a suggestion - the meowing is so loud and consistent, it is something that I can't see working.

Sorry for the essay. Any thoughts on the above?",2024-11-12 12:07:09
