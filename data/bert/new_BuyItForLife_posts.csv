I am not a very smelly dude and have very good hygiene. Might be TMI but I have barely any form of body odor in anyway. Doesnt matter if I sweat all day and haven't showered in two or three days, so naturally my wool clothing takes FOREVER to get any type of odor. The only type of smell any of my shirts get is the neck gets too smell like head oil like an old pillowcase. 

I'm trying to find a way to wash all of my items together safely. From pants, to button ups to socks. 

So far my plan is a gently machine wash WITHOUT detergent and then hang to dry. 

I know this is not a BIFL request, it's more like a ""Preserve it for life"". However, the other sub I asked hasn't answered anything and googling it shows me multiple different answers and so does the reddit search bar.

I'm new here. I'm French.

I've never been a collector and have always preferred to stick to one only good quality thing. And I guess it's true for many things.

I'm the only here to wear a pair of Red Wing when everyone else change their trendy sneakers every 6 months. I'm the only one keeping my leather jacket when it obviously went out of fashion years ago.

I usually go with stylish but timeless clothes. Sure, I can't afford high quality items in every cases but I feel sick seeing those pseudo fashions brands selling low quality, unrefined t-shirt for 150‚Ç¨.

Anyways, one word that comes up quite often is ""heritage"", should it concern boots (Red Wing), wallets (Craft and Lore), multitools (Leatherman), jackets (Flint and Tinder), watches (Redwood)...

I'm currently considering a waxed trucker jacket from Flint and Tinder, but it seems quite complicated to get it over here in France. And honestly, I'm a bit torn on the subject. It looks very cool and would perfectly suits my style. But when I think about it, in fine, isn't nylon more suite to rain than a piece of overpriced cloth that I have to wax every 6 months ? At which point does heritage needs to be forgotten ?

I'm still quite traumatized by the $500+ Mechanical Hamilton watch that I got and which turned out to be a piece of rubbish. Advertised at 5 ATM it was not even capable of handling a swimming pool session. I moved on to a solar-powered model from Redwood instead.

Also i'm looking to buy button shirts but we're full of pr√™t-√†-porter stores around here and i'm not sure where to start looking to avoid asian factory-made items. i'm not even sure this is possible.

  
Anyways, i'm glad to be here. Thanks

My husband and I recently bought a house, and we're moving in in about 3 weeks. It's a very nice place, but unfortunately the upper bedrooms have carpet. We absolutely hate carpet, mostly because we have pets. All of our pets are seniors, and one of the cats occasionally has urinary issues due to medical problems.

When we got our first place, the floors we had installed were supposedly liquid-proof. Unfortunately, they were not actually, and the company actually ended up getting sued for that (not by us.) 

So my question is: are there hard floors that are *actually* liquid proof? If a pet has an accident or something spills while we're not home, we'd like to have floors that won't be damaged/absorb liquids at all. I'm not sure if such a thing exists. If there's a way to seal up the floors by the baseboards, that would be great as well. ",2024-11-12 01:17:33

I can relay anecdote after anecdote of people with kong toys lasting many many years. I can also relay just as many of people who went to buy new kong toys to replace missing ones or just getting additional ones and the new recipe, they've said, is terrible. Apparently they're making them smaller now and the rubber smells of heavy chemicals, and even the black ""heavy chewer"" models are chewed through quite easily now so you have to buy more to replace them more frequently since the old ones were so indestructible that they only needed to be replaced when lost which isn't great for sales. I've heard a lot of people are moving away from them now because of this. It really breaks my heart because you could always rely on kong when I was a kid. They were built to last.


I have a 9kg korean village dog that is very careful not to tear up his favorite not so chew proof hollow rubber balls but can absolutely demolish one of those bark nylabone things in only a few sittings. I want him to have a nice durable chew toy that he can go all out on for hours on end every day and not have to worry about destroying it and losing to the trash can. He's got some pretty surprisingly powerful jaws when he wants to really chew through something so I need something that won't break his teeth like a nylabone, raw bone, antler, etc.

I need what kong use to be before they switched up their recipe. A nice hard rubber bone or kong like chew that will last for years like kong use to.

BuyItForLife,1gq0659,Stomach & Side Sleeper with Broad Shoulders (5‚Äô9‚Äù / 205 lbs): Was Choosing a Firm Mattress a Mistake? Should I Switch to Medium-Firm?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1gq0659/stomach_side_sleeper_with_broad_shoulders_59_205/,9,"I‚Äôve recently bought a firm innerspring mattress on my brother‚Äôs advice, as he strongly recommended it. However, I‚Äôm beginning to think this may have been a mistake. I‚Äôm a stomach and side sleeper, naturally have broad shoulders, and am 1.76 m (5‚Äô9‚Äù) tall, weighing 93 kg (205 lbs), though I‚Äôm currently working on losing weight.

When I first visited a mattress shop, I was very drawn to the comfort of a medium-firm innerspring mattress, especially since both my shoulders were able to sink in comfortably. Despite this, I followed my brother‚Äôs advice and went with the firm option because he told me I‚Äòll f up my back with the medium firm option in the long run as I prefer to lie on the stomach. But medium firm felt just right on the first glance. 

It‚Äôs been a week now, and even though I‚Äôm using a slatted base with an adjustable shoulder section, I can‚Äôt feel any difference. To slightly soften the mattress, I‚Äôve also added a topper, but I still feel it‚Äôs too firm. My gut feeling tells me that this mattress might not be the right choice.

Should I try to get used to the firm mattress as my brother suggests, or should I make use of the 30-day money-back guarantee and go for the medium-firm innerspring mattress instead?",2024-11-13 00:32:42

I decided to buy some aluminium ones however I can only assume that because they‚Äôre metal, they somehow interfere with the RF readers on a lot of the security doors.

The fridge does not have any fans and it has a single compressor, yet manages to keep the top part a freezer and the bottom part a fridge using a clever design for the evaporator coils. He praises the cleverness and simplicity of it.

However, there's one problem: it doesn't actually work. He found this to be due to the thermostat being placed poorly. Essentially, it will work properly if you don't suddenly put a lot of thermal mass in there. But if you do, the thermostat's apparent set point will change, and it will continuously cut off before the interior is actually cold enough.

This really speaks to me because I have dealt with fridges where it's just really finicky to get the fridge to just turn on when the inside gets too warm, and turn off when it's not. I meal prep, which is probably what causes the issue for me. But I don't think I am wrong for meal prepping. Technology can and should accommodate me and my lifestyle, not the other way around.

Fortunately, he was able to apparently fix the problem by just spending $20 on a digital thermostat which he jerry rigged into the fridge to more directly measure the temperature of the fridge. Which leads me to the following question: Is there any fridge on the market which fundamentally shares the same design of the Galanz fridge he reviewed, but has an actually functional thermostat?",2024-11-10 23:36:57

I am in Mexico so Duluth is an incognito wether or no I can get here. I can order from website and pay an insane amount of taxes on them.

The ""daily kit"" which seems to be cotton based developed holes and issues with the elastic quite quickly. The other ones are SuperFit I think and those lasted better, they are the ones with the microperforations. Attached images

However, I have some issues with it. For starters, I don't love that the mouthpiece isn't covered. It's impossible to clean properly and sometimes water will randomly flood the nook the mouthpiece folds down into. Apparently they made a new one that fixed this issue but I'm skeptical and also it's still uncovered. I don't want to switch to the open mouth one because I find it annoying to deal with and that a straw sippy mouthpiece makes me drink more water because it's easier.

I've found a few potential bottles but am not sure if they're the best option. Frank Green, Owala, LARQ, Ello, and Takeya are the names that keep popping up.

So, I am now in search for new headphones! I'm currently really considering JLab Epic Sport ANC. But am open to recommendations!

I want headphones that will last a long time, are resistant to damage, can be worn for longer periods without charging, resistant to the elements, and will stay in my ears and not be uncomfy, and with good sound quality.

I currently own a Iphone 16 Pro Max so these will be for my phone. I don't need my headphones to integrate with my phone, so I don't care for apple products that much - I'm looking for something GOOD.

Also want something that will go on sale for Black Friday. Budget is like 50 dollars or so and it'd be preferable if they were cheaper.

Any recommendation is appreciated. Thanks.

After researching, I've narrowed down my options to Giesswein Vent and Olukai Moloa.

* I need some support for occasional foot issues. A replaceable sole is preferred.
* Even wearing socks, my toes sweat in the winter, causing my socks to get wet and my toes to be freezing when I get in bed. I do plan to upgrade my socks as well.
* I'd like a slipper shoe that is comfortable year round, indoors only.

I decided against Glerups because they don't have a replaceable sole and the leather sole didn't seem supportive enough on its own (rubber seems to be if you want to wear them outside). LL Bean WGS seemed too cozy for winter (though I did consider getting Giesswein for summer and LLB for winter, just worried about the sole). Thanks in advance for your advice or other suggestions!

BuyItForLife,1gj5c9l,PSA: Buy a laser printer!,611,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1gj5c9l/psa_buy_a_laser_printer/,179,"I wanted to make a post about my printer. I recognize that a printer isn't necessarily a ""buy-it-for-life"" kind of thing, but I think you would be hard pressed to find something that represents this much of a value proposition and cost effective option as a laser printer. Specifically, a laser printer like my Brother that I bought. 

Allow me to give a bit of context. My wife and I are both college students, and as you can imagine, have to print a lot of notes. Just this evening, my wife had to print something that was 19 pages long. Previously to purchasing our laser printer, we had one of those crappy Canon Pixma or whatever printers (the bargain printers that can be had sub-$100 at Walmart). I had finally had enough of this printer and so I decided I buy this Brother. I am sure glad that I did. 

One of the issues with the Canon was that it was God awfully slow. A print job like my wife's aforementioned 19 page notes would've taken around 10 minutes to complete. The Brother probably took 1 minute, and that's being generous. And, that's with it printing on both sides of the page to save paper.

Another issue was that it guzzled ink cartridges. I am not exaggerating when I say that this single print job would've probably used half of the ink cartridges on our old Canon. Meanwhile, we've had this toner drum since the beginning of the year, and only now is it saying ""Low Toner"". However, all of the pages came out sharp and non faded, so I don't think it is as low as it may be leading on. 

  
Finally, I just wanted a printer to do just that: print! I think one of the common faults of many new printers is that they're trying to do too much. I have a desk scanner. I don't need my printer to do that. It is much easier for me to use a standalone scanner that have to fiddle with making sure the page is in the right spot or else some of it may be cut off on the scan. I also wanted a printer that I could just hook up via USB to my computer, no internet needed. Yes, I do have it hooked up to an Apple Airport in the office, but that is more so for the ability to print from other computers like my MacBook Pro, instead of just my iMac. I just wanted something SIMPLE, and I am glad that I purchased my Brother laser printer. 

If you, like me, want a no-fuss printer that is great and just *PRINTS*, check out the **Brother HL-L2320D.** ",2024-11-04 03:38:25

I am a 315lb 6'2"" man. I am on my feet 9-12 hours a day. I bought 5 pairs around a year ago from Darn Tough.

I have been wearing the same 5 pairs for about a year now. literally no wear issues. They are honestly. The same as the 1st day i bought them. I also walk 10-15 miles a day during a busy shift. I have been wearing the same clogs/shoes for 10 years now. I used to blow through Hanes etc brands in 3 months.

Around 3 years ago I got tired of crappy socks. So, I went to a suggestion. Bombas. I went with Merino Wool. An old head said wool was best if your on your feet all day. And he was not wrong. Less stinky, comfy less sweat. But, After 3 months or so. All my socks started to get the same wear hole in my heal. I was sad. I spent good money on these socks. Was the wool to blame? Is it less durable? I dunno? So i went with another pack of Bombas Cotton blend.

Same issue. Ok, but they are warrantied.  I got my socks on sale. So I was not able to get back the full return. I bought a 5 pack and was only able to get a 3 pack replacement. Ok, Whatever. I can understand that.

So this is a warning for Bombas. They will NOT replace your socks. They will only reimburse the cost.

But now im kinda angry. Both Bombas blends failed in the same place. As a note. NONE of my cheap walmart buys failed there. They failed in the toe and heal and got thin. But, no Holes, kinda.

So now im looking around again. And I find Darn Tough. American made in Vermont. 100% lifetime. Full Returns/Replace. No questions asked. I did not believe it.

So one night about a year ago from today. I decide to make my move. I go to the Darn Tough website.

I start looking around the socks. I get a ping and one of those annoying chat boxes, "" If you need help""

IT WAS A REAL PERSON!!! No idea where this person was from. But they asked me, What do I do? What will i be doing while wearing the socks. etc. I started grilling them on the return policy, And to be fair it was $20 US a pair. So I was really skeptical on the warranty. No questions asked, Tear, Wear. What if my Dog eats them, etc. Take a Picture, send it in and get a free pair back. Now, To be honest. Its been a year or so plus. Same 5 pairs. Feel and fit the same as day one. Not thinning. No holes. Nothing.

So I cannot elaborate on Darn Tough warranty. But I can say. That I had a REAL person help me pick out my socks. For what I would be doing. He actually suggested the Hiker 3/4 cut wool blend.  And I have never been happier. I only now have stress on losing one to the Dryer Goblin.

In closing. If your on the fence and are on your feet all day in good foot wear. Get Darn Tough.

I'm a university student who just recently lost a roommate who was the one who bought all of the cutlery/dishes. I'm looking to splurge (maximum 200$) on a nice set of dishes that can survive anything my roomates would put on them/use them for and that I can take with me for the rest of my life. Green ones are prefferable, the more weird looking the better.   
I need them to have large sizes for regular people. Although I promise im not an ant, Im a little autistic and cant bring myself to eat from full-size plating. ive survived off of ""baby's first sets"" for so long and they keep getting scratched or breaking and I would like to have a brand that carries stuff for adults as well as smaller plating for me (tea plates and small 1.5 bowls are fine) that will last for years to come. 

I've read through all the posts for dishes but I feel like there isnt a consensus, as well as me needing expandable packs. These are the requirements for what I'm looking for:

Main requirements: 

\- Has expandable ""packs"" (this is what is missing in most suggestions, I would like to be able to buy a set of bowls/plates for 6 people, and have the option of buying mugs and cups!)  
\- Brand sells medium-small bowls! (around 1.5 cup bowls as well as the traditional size, small tea plates and small tea cups)  
\- For the silverware, just anything that will last will do. Im looking for <100$ for that set, prefferably <50$. Has to have expandable sets where they also sell small tea spoons.

Preferences:  
\- <200$ for a set of 6 (I can go a little higher if it matches everything else!)  
\- Green, black, or a mix of the two! (White is fine maybe)

I feel like I'm searching for a unicorn set of plates but I'm hoping someone can help haha!

The older, cheaper, simple white one I got (HealthyWhite) lasted the longest and still works. I had it in a drawer for 4 years that I didn't touch. I took it out and it worked. It still holds a charge and doesn't die quickly or anything, so I'm using it again.

I have a DiamondClean 9700 that I got a couple years ago. Smart, modern, supposed to be the best. It suddenly started disconnecting while charging recently then stopped charging. It won't turn on or charge. I took it apart rather than give Philips more money (not too hard to open). 

Water got inside and corroded parts of the board and battery contacts. That's when I saw the buildup of calcium/toothpaste just under the seal, near the bottom, and signs of oxidation on different metal parts. I did my best to clean with isopropyl alcohol and wiping away residue and letting it dry, but it's just toast. 

The battery is showing like 0.3v when I test it and it's supposed to be 3.8v (what my other one shows). Maybe it *could* be saved and charged with the right tools but there's some soldering and stuff involved.

Should I try to repair it or how do I find someone who can fix it in my area for cheap? The higher models are like $300 and it's funny they magically fail RIGHT when the replacement protection ends. 

The seal on the top seems engineered to get tiny perforations to cause this, because without water inside it's very hard to break one of these. There's always some hard buildup on the rubber that breaks it.",2024-11-02 19:07:56

The technology around them allows the printer to be built for insanely cheap, so for a long time manufacturers operated on the Razor + Blade model where  you get the printer for next to nothing and pay a ton for ink. The manufacturers don't care about the quality of these printers because that isn't where the money is.

This remained the status quo until about a decade ago when Epson broke from the pack and we now have tanked printers from nearly every manufacturer. These printers don't use ink cartridges and instead have built in reservoirs that hold the ink, the ink can be easily refilled with bottles that are sold for very little. These follow a traditional pricing model where most of the money is made upfront and the operating cost is minimal.

**BIFLness:**

Inkjet Printers are simpler devices than laser printers and when built well don't fail very often. You may need to run cleaning cycles to unclog the print heads from time to time, but since the ink is cheap it's not a big deal. The main failure point on a tanked printer is that the waste ink reservoir gets filled and cannot be emptied. More premium models have removable reservoirs (often called maintenance boxes), this is an essential feature for the printer to be considered BIFL. Removable print heads are also nice, but not necessary. When properly taken care of a tanked printer should meet or beat the life span of a laser printer.

**Upfront Cost:**

Tanked Inkjet Printers are cheaper than Color Laser Printers, especially when you introduce the ancillary features such as scanning and faxing. B&W Inkjet printers aren't common on the market so B&W laser printers will (almost) always be the cheapest bare-bones option.

**Operating Cost:**

Tanked Printers are much cheaper to run than Laser. The numbers all over the board, but I would say anywhere from 50-90% cheaper.

**Features/Use Cases:**

Tanked printers produce more vibrant colors than Laser and can be printed on a wider variety of materials including vinyl and photo paper. Some are specifically designed for photo printing and produce professional quality prints. Tanked printers are also smaller (than color laser) and don't run as hot as laser printers.

Laser printers on the other hand print much faster, and the prints won't run when in contact with water (perfect for outside fliers). The printers are also more resilient to being jostled or moved to another location (tanked printers have liquid inside and need to be kept as level as possible after initial filling).

**Addendum :**

Office supply stores typically are the best places to buy printers and ink/toner. Staples (for example) has been running promotions where you get anywhere from 30-50% back on the printer/ink purchase in rewards. You can price match these down to the same price as amazon and then just enjoy the free rewards.

**TLDR:**

Not all Inkjets use cartridges, those that don't can be BIFL and are better and cheaper than Laser Printers depending on use case.

I‚Äôve decided it would be a good time to round up some of my favorite upgrades that have significantly contributed to a better quality of life for myself and my family. Each of these purchases have involved extensive research on this sub, YouTube and various other non-sponsored review sites. See below, in no particular order: 


- Lodge Cast Iron: I have one with sides and one without. Been using these two skillets exclusively for the past 10 years. I have never owned a non stick pan because there is no need to when your cast iron is well seasoned. Note, I also have their enameled Dutch oven for soups/bread but I would one day like to upgrade to Le Creuset or Staub because I don‚Äôt love the rounded base. 

- SEBO E3 bagged canister vacuum: I upgraded from a Dyson V8 stick and the difference is astounding. The air quality in my home is significantly better and I enjoy that I don‚Äôt have to empty it after every use and disperse dust and allergens everywhere. 

- Feathered Friends bedding: There is nothing better than fluffy luxury down comforter and pillows. I appreciate that their duvet is over 99% responsibly sourced down. I thought the duvet insert I had previously was ‚Äúdown‚Äù but upon further research, it was actually 90% feathers and 10% down. You really can tell the difference in comfort and warmth with true down. I also have their organic cotton sheets and duvet cover which I love. 

- Room & Board solid wood furniture: Making the switch from veneered, MDF, particle board furniture to solid wood has been life changing. I purchased a white oak dining table and a walnut bookcase and am impressed with the beauty and quality of these pieces. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it in the long run to have furniture that can be passed down and only get better with time. 

- Chefs knife: I have a ZWILLING 8 inch chefs knife made in Germany. It‚Äôs great but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the only good chefs knife out there. But it‚Äôs the only knife I need aside from a Victorinox paring knife. Upgrading from a cheap knife block with 8+ useless knives has been life changing.


That‚Äôs all I can think of right now! My house has 20 year old Kenmore white appliances that have honestly been great, but my next upgrade will be new appliances when those kick it. I‚Äôm thinking Bosch based on reviews.

On the other hand, the 21k gold fountain pen also seems like a great choice.

So a while back the house got renovated a bit and my office has been closed off from the central A/C on purpose. The room has my music equipment (which is a big reason why I need a dehumidifier), computers, etc. Using a window 'saddle' style A/C unit (GE Profile or some such) but it's not quite enough to lower humidity to what I need.

I was using this Humilabs 30pt/2000sq ft dehumidifer set up above the A/C on a shelf with continuous drain out the window and that worked pretty decent. Well, it seems that just up and died on me in less than a year (bought late Feb '24).

Looking for a replacement. Something that has continuous drain, no auto-shut off, and quiet. Budget not as much of a concern. Not looking for an affordable/budget type option that'll die in a year, I'm definitely willing to pay for something quality that will last at least 2-3+ years. Just hopefully the physical footprint isn't too huge.

Room really isn't that big, somewhere in the neighborhood of \~250 sq ft or some such, but it's a constant battle fighting the humidity.

I am pretty frugal so people are confused at all these nice purchases I have made. However, the quality of some of the BIFL items are crazy and you can just tell it will last for years.

I was thinking about all the BIFL purchases I made this year and got curious to see what others have bought this year that they are hopping will last decades or for life. Figured id make a little post to see what y'all got. 

I just recently purchased some bedding that is really well made and will certainly hold up for many, many, many years. 

I purchased a PineTales millet husk pillow and it's the most comfortable pillow I have ever owned. I'm a very picky sleeper and often use many pillows and even blankets to life my head to the desired height. Not with this though. This thing perfectly fits what I need.

I bought a Redlands cotton king blanket because I have been trying to stay away from the synthetics and needed a blanket and I love this thing. I soon realized since it's getting cold, that cotton is VERY breathable and doesn't store a lot of your body heat. 

After realizing this was gonna be the best summer blanket ever, I realized I would need something to actually keep me warm and so I bought a fauribault (faribalt?) wool queen blanket and this thing is absolutely fantastic 

So what purchases have you made this year and what ones have stood out or exceeded your expectations? ",2024-11-01 17:34:16

Obviously this has always been an issue, but feels like it's gotten a lot worse after the pandemic with the sheer number of brands doing this. In the past it seems that this was mostly due to a brand name being bought by a different company with no ties to the original, but now it seems that previously reputable companies are completely willing to cash in on their brand reputation to drastically decrease quality to avoid raising prices. 

Now here's the conundrum - how does one navigate this for long lasting quality goods? If someone says something lasted 10 years, I don't find that to be a trustworthy claim for the company anymore because it seems like for most things what was being sold 10 years ago is drastically different from what is being sold now. But then on recent reviews there is no way to tell if something is being made to the same standards because there's no way to tell if something is going to last 10 years otherwise.

I was attempting to buy a wool blanket from [Shopgoodwill.com](http://Shopgoodwill.com) there was one I liked which was a green Van Wyk blanket made in Holland. It looked comfy & said health blanket (not sure why that marketing appealed to me). with 20 seconds left as I was attempting to place a bid the website glitched out on me - wasn't loading when I refreshed and sent me to a different page I got back to it. Anyhow I didn't win it and the Van Wyk blankets are expensive on eBay.

  
I started looking around - there are some more on [shopgoodwill.com](http://shopgoodwill.com) but shipping is usually a bit much - anywhere from $20 to $40 to ship the blankets. Looking locally on Facebook marketplace I've found some that are going for less than the price of shipping of the ones I am seeing on shop good will. One is from Norway and has a photo of a sun, another is Utah Woolen Mills, and the last is Horner Woolen Mills from Eaton Rapids, MI (looks a little itchy). Will these last a good deal of time or are you better splurging and buying the name brand ones - Hudson Bay, Whitneys, Pendleton, Orrlaskan, Fairbo, Chatham? 

Purpose of it will be to keep warm, I will be sleeping in a van in a very cold and snowy area this winter. It will be under a goose down comforter. Am I good going with the wool I haven't heard of, and additionally any way by looking at the photos you can gauge the warmth and if it will be itchy or not?

Learned of American Trench

American Trench are nice socks but have an equivalent of a sock achilles heel. The toe stitching is trash. LITERALLY, one pair I purchased broke on the first wear. These are $30/pair. Wrote it off as a manufacturing defect, but it happened again.

Do NOT consider American Trench socks for longevity

  
EDIT: I should have noted that both Bambas and American Trench socks were Merino Wool. Possibly this material is difficult to manufacture in lasting quality.

BuyItForLife,1gg8j1m,Hiking Boots - Care for them!,125,https://i.redd.it/9t3wpbh2i1yd1.jpeg,28,"I bought a pair of Altberg Malham Hiking boots in 2020. A bit of BIFL research indicates these could last decades. They are made in the UK still, in North Yorkshire.

I didn't understand care properly.

I have been regularly waxing them with the recommended (by the specialist I bought them from) wax but they started to crack.

I recently took them for a resole and the amazing man in the shop explained this is caused by salt crystals in the sweat and as well as cleaning the outside and waxing to protect the weather, you need to wash them out too! Maybe once every 6 months. But doing so prevents this and increases the life of the boots.

1) Clean them after use so the mud doesn't dry and spoil the leather
2) wax them  monthly, or more frequently if use is heavy
3) wash the insides out too
4) replace the laces once in a while
5) resole when worn with a specialist 
6) replace the insoles with super feet

Should get at least another 5 years out of these despite 4 years of not washing the inside!!!

Maybe longer. So long as they stay water proof and I resole when needed, they can just keep going.

Massive thanks to Foothills in Sheffield for setting me on the path, Feet First in Chesterfield (hiking and climbing boot repair specialist) and the master boot maker from Altberg on YouTube which I should have watched sooner!

The Aeronaut 45 (now available in a miller 30 str size) Is a backpack bag combo.  It has been all over the world packed full and slung around on one shoulder strap more times than I can imagine .  It's made from 1050 ballistic nylon and has been a fantastic travel product. I always carry one on when flying internationally so if the checked bag disappears I can get by on what I have on me.

The Red Oxx Airboss is the ultimate capacity carry on,  or an incredible weekender Its made from 1000 weight cordial nylon from Dupont. It's a bag only vs backpack design but its rectangular design lets you get an incredible amount of stuff in it.

The Redd Oxx metro bag fits right in the center of the airbus  and allows me to carry a smaller more dense bag upon arrival a remote destination. It's perfect to carry everything you need for a day at a remote location with just enough padding on the bottom to protect against a drop, and swappable storage.

Either of these will fit in a regional jet if reasonably packed and not bulging.

Of the two manufacturers shoulder straps-  the Tom Bihn shoulder strap is the better unit - is incredible,  made of stretchy material that lets weight sit comfortably and doesn't slide off - I've bought  these from my garden tools like a my Stihl FS 70 trimmer.

Both of these are as close as its possible to get to buy once items. I suppose you could theoretically wear an anvil out if you worked at it hard enough.

BuyItForLife,1gflvqg,"According to Travelpro, ""Lifetime"" is 2 years for a zipper. I'm left disappointed by their warranty service.",864,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1gflvqg/according_to_travelpro_lifetime_is_2_years_for_a/,140,"I'm not normally one to complain publically, but since recommendations from subreddits like this influenced my original purchasing decision, I figured it would make sense to write here so other people can know what to expect.



About two and a half years ago, I purchased a Maxlite 5 Air set from Travelpro, which was a hard-sided carry-on and checked bag combo.



On my last trip, I noticed the zipper teeth for one of the internal compartments has detached from the lining, letting one of the pulls fall halfway off (meaning you can't zip it closed). That sucks, but no worries! I've got a lifetime warranty that should fix that.



After a few emails, it was made clear to me that ""Unfortunately, after more than two years of use of your luggage, it is no longer considered a manufacturing defect."", and went on to call it either wear-and-tear or abuse.



I haven't abused the bag, and I refuse to accept that 2-years is the ""wear and tear life"" of a well-made zipper.



I've gone back and forth with customer service, and they've ultimately told me there's nothing they can or will do.



So here's my question to Travelpro: What, exactly, is the purpose of a ""lifetime limited warranty"", if after 2 years you will claim anything that happens is a manufacturing defect or the users fault? That's not a lifetime warranty, that's a 2-year warranty.



I'm going to end up repairing the suitcase myself at my own expense, but this is the last time I'll buy or recommend Travelpro.

  
TL;DR: Bought a bag, after 2 years the internal zipper detached and Travelpro told me to get bent.",2024-10-30 12:57:33

I haven't been able to find a pair that is totally BIFL. Though, I have researched some brands that are what I found to be quality. The work is a mix of lab/office and indoor construction, so overalls would be convenient. I'd be kneeling a lot, but sitting down and standing almost as much.

I've narrowed down my options to: 

Duluth Trading Fire Hose HD Lined Bib Overalls - on sale right now for $90, normally $130. Comes with kneepad pocket. 

Engelbert Strauss Multipocket Work Bib Overalls - $90 - No knee pockets.

Liberty Bib Overalls off the rack from Tractor Supply- $50 No knee pockets.

Basically, I'm not too concerned about the 'features' on each product (more or less each have what I need at a minimum) except the knee pads, which seem surprisingly rare in overalls across the board. I've heard good things about the quality/longevity of all three brands. I'm leaning towards the Strausses but Deluth seems like the easiest option (also best warranty) and obviously Liberty might be the economic play. However, for those and the Strausses I'd need to add the kneepad pockets myself, which I'd be fine with since they don't have any warranty really. My questions are:

1) Would you personally consider any of these products/brands BIFL? Can they be considered BIFL on quality alone? What brand of overalls fall under BIFL?
2) Do these brands still retain their reputation for quality in your experience?
3) Which of these are the best value overall?


Any other suggestions/brands are encouraged.",2024-10-31 00:20:51

This is a woman's sweater, but they have styles that are unisex/for men as well. It took a few weeks to arrive from Spain, but the quality is undeniable. It's amazing how different it feels from even my pricier other Merino sweaters. They also included some yarn for any repairs in the future. I'm not wool sensitive, but it doesn't feel itchy at all. Because it's a bit heavier knit, the sweater feels a little bit stiffer when you first put it on. The yarn on this sweater is a thicker yarn than I've had on previous store bought sweaters. It feels more hand knit. All sweaters are knitted to order in Spain. The red color is so bright it's got maybe a hint of orange. It's so vibrant I love it!

For women curious about sizing, I ended up with a size small. I did email them for sizing help because I wanted to make sure I got the right fit. My measurements are 35 chest, 29 waist, and 41 hips.

To be honest - it didn't make much sense with the higher priced pieces coz with price multiple could just buy a new one after a few years and based on some reasonable assumptions on how long they would last - seems hard to break even.

None the less - I ended up with a few pieces from Briggs and Reily and a piece from Victorinox.  Sharing experience between the two after all these years (posting motivated by recent warrantary claim on the latter piece) 

Key Takeways

1) Warrantary Geographic Coverage 

For those living outside US, you gotta watch out if you think it is a truly 'international' warrantary.  The advertising you see would come from Corporate HQ but the actual coverage depends on whether your country has authorized dealers (and how many there are).

What I have found:

Australia

B&R - major city would have one place to get service.  Generally ok if you live in one of the state capitals otherwise really hard to get service. 

Victorinox - slightly better with a couple in big cities; but again - living outside state capitals will make it hard.

Singapore

Both brands are serviced out of a multi-line specialist luggage repair shop.  It is a bit far from CCR (but hey! Singapore is small) - so a bit of hike to get things done; but coverage is there.

Hong Kong

B&R - used to have a AD; but closed since COVID and not reopen since; however they do seem responsive to self-service claims (see below)

Victorinox - have active sales channel and service centre located in NT.  Again a hike to get things done but from AD itself so can complain to corporate if issues

2) Warrantary Reliability

  
B&R - Advertise the 'no matter what' on their warrantary - and when in HK; found it to be largely true --- they don't have service centre; so have to get out the screwdriver and do repairs myself - but they will happily send parts via FedEx with no questions asked.  Did 3 times on the couple of pieces I have and they never pushback

Victoronix - Quite a bad experience despite from official service centre.  Did warrantary claim asking to replace wheels which were worn.  Got told 'this line is discontinued - we can do trade in program instead where you buy more stuff at a discount'.  Told them no way as coverage was based on older lifetime warrantary.  After a bit of time, they came back saying 'ok ok we have the \*last\* one for you' - and they grudingly did it - also afterwards did give me a stern 'we really don't have parts to do this again and you need to do trade in next time'.

Was quite upset at this because even under the new 10 year warrantary terms, my piece would still be within scope and so their 'discontinued' explanation just felt like a way to get more money out of me. 

  
End conclusion - the value of lifetime warrantaries best where brand is based out of and also you need to checkout whether company is really willing to stand behind their claims at point of sale...",2024-10-29 06:11:48

BuyItForLife,1gdnyhc,Sewing Machine Suggestions,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1gdnyhc/sewing_machine_suggestions/,11,"Hi friends, hope you don't mind another sewing machine suggestion request. Due to low karma, I couldn't post in the sewing subreddit :(

I've been looking through many BIFL posts and such, but I'm still \*very\* unsure. Something I heard is if I'm serious about having the ability to sew a wide variety of things, I might require multiples machines, some which are specialized. Please let me know if that is my case! Although I hope it isn't. I am pretty much a complete beginner.

My budget is maybe $200 for a used machine, although I'd rather spend even less. I perused FB marketplace but I trust a repair shop more. The shop I'm in contact with said I should go look on my own, and then bring them a list of specific models, then they'll see if they have a refurbished unit in stock. So I've come here for help.

Below are lists of machine features I found through cursory research.

Things I really want in a machine:  
\- metal gears  
\- inexpensive replacement parts (i.e. no Berninas or proprietary parts)  
\- a machine where repairs are long-lasting, and maintenance is not frequent  
\- some form of speed control  
\- can sew very fast with \*little to no\* stitch skipping, provides very good stitch quality  
\- capable of decorative stitching  
\- darning foot  
\- free arm for sewing cuffs/pant legs  
\- needle up/down for sewing corners/points

Things I think I want:  
\- top load bobbin  
\- automatic threading  
\- auxiliary spool pin to wind new bobbins faster

This is what I want to make:  
\- all types of clothing, including nice dresses and fine suits, even costumes  
\- denim repair  
\- detailed plushies  
\- female undergarments, especially bras  
\- gloves, potentially of leather

One question-- and I may not understand what I'm asking: do I really need a serger machine, or are there older machines that will do both this and regular sewing? I would like clean hems to prevent fraying and make long-lasting garments.

I've come across these used machines online (not from a reputable shop iykwim). Can anyone can give their thoughts on them? Maybe they're worth a shot despite the risk. Not sure if I'm allowed to list their costs.  
\- kenmore 1792  
\- kenmore 158 16900 (has a video demo, seems in good condition)  
\- janome 2212  
\- janome 2003P

Should I ask the shop if they have... a Singer Slant-O-Matic 401A? Although it doesn't have a free arm, I'm sure there must be ways to sew cuffs/sleeves/pant legs without it.

Thanks so very much in advance.",2024-10-27 23:11:39

Temps can range from 40-10*f pretty often with the occasional colder temps. Sometimes it's a 1/2 mile walk to a hide, sometimes 3 miles or more. 


I'm hoping to find a new camo jacket as my current one as been used for nearly 20 years and is really showing it's wear. I dont mind buy once, cry once if itll last.  Wind and water proof are high priority, with plenty of warmth being greatly preferred to uninsulated options.  Wool or similar insulation is preferred to down do to heavy underbrush and thorns shredding puffer style coats.  US made would be great, but I understand how limited that selection is. 


So far I'm debating the Kuiu Proximity, kuiu Kenai, kuiu DCS Guide, first lite core, first lite thermic and forloh AllClima jackets. The Proximity looks nice but the fabric looks like it'll catch thorns and stick tights like crazy. Kenai and DCS guide may be light on warmth. I'm leery of testing new first lite options. Forloh there just isn't a ton of info on. 


Any reccomendations, reviews, or tips on sales would be greatly appreciated.

The problem is, I have no idea *which* heavy to choose - I‚Äôm interested in the pieces of a particular brand that offer options of different gsm weights, from 450 right up to 1000,  but I‚Äôm not sure which one to buy.

All that said, I‚Äôm looking for some guidance - I have my eyes on a hoodie that‚Äôs supposedly 700 gsm, which sounds quite hefty but not the brand's heaviest. Would that be suitable for what I‚Äôm looking for? Is it too heavy? Not enough?

The fit is also kind of strange...I'm 6foot 170lbs and have to wear a size large for them to not be too tight on my boys.

I'm looking to try some new brands and see most of the discussions online are for boxers/boxer-briefs, but I'm strictly a briefs man. I made the switch from Patagonia boxers about 15 years ago to briefs and love not having a bunch of excess fabric all bunched in my pants. My first foray into briefs was from a brand in Brooklyn called Left Field/Choctaw Ridge and they were nice/comfy, but pricey and I had the same issue with the waistband fraying.

I'm seeking a comfy pair of briefs without a bunch of branding on the waistband...very minimalist. I go over the fence and have no use for a gate, but can live with having a gate if the fit/material is nice. I've been wearing cotton for years as I hated the material Patagonia used, if I didn't do a very thorough tinkle pee would not absorb into the undies and run down my leg and drive me insane....not opposed to a modern tech fabric as long it has some tinkle absorption-ability.

Any fellow brief wearers have some suggestions for brands to try?



I'm just re-starting this quest after talking about it for years to my wife...I bought some expensive French briefs 10 years ago that are a really nice material/style, but the size large fits like an American extra-small. Wasting 80 bucks on 2 pairs of undies made me give up searching for 10 years and just dealt with Duluth being my default brand out of laziness.

I‚Äôm currently dealing with drugstore beetles.

My mom and I just made a Flan and I will no longer partake because I just saw a dead drugstore beetle on top of the flan (i think it was in the sugar my mom used to make the caramel). 

About two weeks ago we bought a Sams club pack of 12 ‚Äúairtight‚Äùg containers. But one of the small containers whenever I lift the top without taking the handle seal out still lifts so it‚Äôs not airtight. I need airtight container. Any recommendations?? And to be clear I don‚Äôt trust the sams club containers anymore but the sugar my mom used for the flan wasn‚Äôt in one of the sams club containers, it was a ordinary containers that we had laying around. It‚Äôs definitely not airtight.

I‚Äôm in the Midwest(Illinois) and there are going to sit inside our pantry. We use them frequently because they are our sugar, flour, cereal, ect. We‚Äôre willing to pay around 100 for 24 pieces if they are good quality. Under 100 would be amazing ideal.  ",2024-10-25 20:58:14

For how old of a model it is, it‚Äôs in pretty decent condition and the only noticeable issues are it‚Äôs a little stinky (needs a wash), the bag and some of the waterproofing strips are delayering, and it is missing a rain fly. Got in contact with the warranty department and apparently they need me to mail it in to evaluate (yes I did double check if it was necessary). I‚Äôm pondering that little checkbox on the warranty form for ‚Äúif we can‚Äôt fix it (presumably meaning finding a suitable rain fly replacement) do you want it back or do you want a gift card.‚Äù 

The tent model is almost 20 years old from what I‚Äôve seen. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to take her out for a test run and see how the overall waterproofing is doing. But also it was $30. 

What are other peoples‚Äô experiences with the TNF warranty gift card option? Was it a considerable fraction of the cost of a newer model or replacement item, or did you still have to put out a good chunk of cash to replace it?

To summarize, I'm looking for lights that I can attach to my house that are similar to Christmas lights. They would be small and almost unnoticeable unless you really look hard at them (No large classic bulbs). I'm hoping to have a nice powerful LED light on them that really gives a good glow from a distance.

A few other things, I would love for them to be very high quality that I wouldn't have to replace them in a few years. I know this is buy it for life, but I'm not sure I could get so lucky, I think I can at least ask for 10 years or so maybe? As far as the programable part, I would like at a minimum to at least change the color of the light from multiple solid colors and also dual colors. A bonus would be if I had full range of choice for coloring with an app that would let me customize it all.

The last thing I'm looking for is the ability to make gaps in the lines nicely to outline awnings that are a bit a part from each other. I don't want to trail the lights to go from one to the other. This means that one strand could be like 10-20 lights, while another strand could be 50-70.

On to the things I don't want and what I've already looked at. There are a few good brands of awesome programable light strands, but they are not rated well for extended outdoor use. These are mostly good for indoor Christmas trees. Second, there is a light that has been popping up the last couple years that I really do not like at all. They are not traditional where you see the light just glowing on the house, these are designed to go under the awning and cast light onto the sides of the house. I do not like the way the light casts on the house and the shadows.

Here is an example image showing how there is a gap between the window awnings. I want to do something simple like this with my house. The bulbs here are a little big for what I want and I fear these would be noticeable during the day. I'm trying to not have the HOA get on me for having them up year round...

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and any recommendations you make. I'm going to research anything posted here and see if it will work for me.

Looking for a boot I can wear all over city terrain and light woods terrain too.

It seems the only thing carrying the Senior is its power and reliability, two traits that are valuable when processing 20 heads a day. But what if you're just working on yourself, and friends/family? Then, do priorities change?

So what IS actually better about the newer clippers from BabyLiss and JRL and Andis and ErgoX and Cyborg and so on?

One thing I do like about the Seniors from a BIFL perspective is the metal construction, and ease-of-repair. Even the battery can be easily replaced.

I'm looking at convertible bags and adaptive backpacks, because i have mobility and joint problems and would benefit from having multiple ways to wear it depending on the day.

For shoes, I'm looking for something similar to classic doc martens (when they still had the lifetime warranty) but with a thicker sole, kind of like their current Jadon boots?

The utensils basket is also on the door (although detachable), so there's always food bits trapped between the basket and the door, and also at the bottom of the basket between basket and the bottom of the dishwasher at the end of the wash. The pods don't dissolve half of the time. Sometimes even the not so dirty cups would get other debris baked onto the bottom of the cups at the end of a wash. 

This dishwasher also doesn't lock during a wash cycle, which I was surprised by because I thought all dishwashers locked once started like a laundry washing machine ... I've also run this dishwasher empty with dishwasher cleaning pods monthly and it doesn't seem to improve anything. 

At my last place I had a Bloomberg dishwasher that didn't matter what I threw in there, or how dirty, it always washed everything sparkling clean. Never had issues in the 6 years I lived at that place, and I didn't even know dishwashers had to be cleaned because how clean it always was lol. However I'm finding out now that Bloomberg is a kinda crappy brand from some googling.
