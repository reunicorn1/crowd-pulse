I’m a productivity nut and always wanted a fast daily planner that didn’t aggravate me after a few weeks of use. I’ve worked on **Finalist** for almost two years now and the latest version is the best one yet 😀 It’s heavily inspired by paper-based day planning methods:

* **Tasks** (and **Reminders**) are front and center, each day gets a page
* Integrated **iOS calendars** and **Apple Weather** for each day, no need for app switching
* Adding tasks can automatically add calendar entries using **natural language**
* **Nested lists** for tasks you’re not ready to schedule yet
* Use **Shared Reminders Lists** and manage them through the app
* **Pin** any list to Today to help you work through projects
* Optional **Evening Prompts** to help you plan the next day
* **Color tags** and **bookmarks** to categorize your tasks
* Lists can automatically **sum** quantities or dollar amounts
* **No accounts to create:** all native iCloud sync, with OPML backup
* Fully **Swift/SwiftUI** app, with native versions for **iPadOS**, **macOS** and **visionOS**.
* **Themes**, themes and more themes. **Widgets** and bunch of **Shortcuts** included.

The basic app will work for free, licensed it’s $39.99 per year or $69.99 for Lifetime but I’m trying something new today - **get Lifetime for free** for the next 24 hours, with Family Sharing. I’d love to get more feedback of what you like and dislike about the app so I can make it even better.

**What’s next?** Tighter integration with Reminders, cooler macOS UI, more fun features for visionOS. It’s all underway and we have quite a community driving this forward 😀

Apple,1go5pt6,My two latest visionOS apps are now FREE in the App Store!,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1go5pt6/my_two_latest_visionos_apps_are_now_free_in_the/,22,"I have now changed my two latest visionOS apps to the whopping price of $0.00! I want to get them into more peoples hands to help keep the community enjoying spatial apps!

They are 100% free with an option to tip, if you would choose. Nothing is paywalled, so tipping is purely optional and not needed for any features.

The apps are:

1.	Fanbience: Ambient Fan Sounds

Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fanbience-ambient-fan-sounds/id6670623502

This app was inspired by a friend and her love for the sound of fans. So instead of being a typical app with sounds like rain, or fire, I thought about fans and their various different kinds and sounds! So this app allows you to place realistic looking and sounding fans around your environment. You can adjust the sound and reverb of each fan. There are 8 different fan types to choose from:

	•	Box Fan
	•	Standing Fan
	•	Tower Fan
	•	Bladeless Fan
	•	Air Conditioner
	•	Ceiling Fan
	•	Table Fan
	•	Air Vent

Let the record show, I tried to call this “Only Fans: Ambient Sounds” but Apple (understandably) wasn’t allowing it since it was too close to the OnlyFans trademark, haha. They wouldn’t even allow a simple tagline of “The Only Fans You Need!” I understand and expected this, but hey, it was worth a shot!

-–––––––

2.	Visionary: Earnings Tracker

Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visionary-earnings-tracker/id6692608433

Inspired by other similar earnings apps, I decided to take this motivating concept and flesh it out with some ideas and preferences of my own, and after much deliberation, polished it to release it to the world! This allows you to get a visual of the money you are earning while working. Whether it is for fun, motivation, or to track how much to bill a client, I personally found this concept super motivating! Having something tangible in front of you versus just a number really makes it feel rewarding, in my opinion.

It currently only supports USD and I am considering adding other currency in the future!

-–––––––

I hope you guys enjoy and these help make your lives a little better! Thanks for all the love and support!",2024-11-10 17:22:47
Apple,1go6zxg,"[GIVEAWAY] To celebrate the release of my task manager/calendar app on 2 new platforms (watchOS and visionOS), the Lifetime IAP is free for the next 36 hours!",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1go6zxg/giveaway_to_celebrate_the_release_of_my_task/,50,"EDIT: If you are using an iPhone running iOS 17, and experience a crash when editing items, please try updating to version 4.0.2. I apologise for the bug!

Hi r/apple,

About 4 months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ejs8gv/i_spent_2_years_making_yet_another_todo_app_yata/) introducing [Yet Another Todo App (Yata)](https://apps.apple.com/app/yata-yet-another-to-do-app/id1631370175), and the positive reception was extremely motivating. As a result, my goal of making a native app on every Apple platform (well, almost--sorry Apple TV!) has been reached much earlier than I ever anticipated!

To express my gratitude for this subreddit, the **Lifetime IAP** will be free for the next 36 hours! To redeem it, simply follow the steps below:

1.	Install [Yata](https://apps.apple.com/app/yata-yet-another-to-do-app/id1631370175) from the App Store
2.	Open Yata.
3.	Navigate to the **Settings** tab on iPhone, or through the **(...)** more button in the sidebar on iPad.
4.	Tap the banner at the top of the page to present the paywall.
5.	Tap **""All Plans""** at the bottom-left, and select the **""Lifetime""** option.
6.	If the deal has not expired, the price should be **$0.00**. Tap **""Continue""** to complete the purchase.

Please note that the IAP is only accessible on the iPhone and iPad apps.

If you are new to Yata, I've included parts of my previous post below to provide more details about the app:

  
\---



# Why should I try Yet Another Todo App?

Instead of listing all the features you’d expect from a todo app (yes, it has lists/projects/tags/subtasks, natural language processing, shortcuts integration, interactive widgets, iCloud sync, and all that jazz), here’s what I think makes Yata unique:

🗓️ **Unified Calendar**: View and manage your todos and calendar events in one place with the integrated Calendar view. You can manage your time at various resolutions by switching between the **List, Day, 3-Day, 5-Day, Week, and Month views**. You can also easily make plans and adapt to changes with intuitive drag and drop gestures to reschedule items on the Calendar.

🎨 **Theming**: Yata takes theming to a new level, offering an intuitive and delightful experience for exploring, customising, and managing various aesthetics to make the app uniquely yours. Yata allows you to **customise the colours used throughout the app**, including the widgets!

📥 **Captures**: Unlike many apps in this space, Yata allows you to **create, store and manage non-actionable items**. This encourages you to capture your thoughts in an unfiltered manner, without the cognitive burden of fleshing out the thought in the moment or the psychological effect of having ""incomplete"" tasks that aren’t actually completable.



# Aren’t you going to be sherlock-ed soon?

While it is true that the built-in Calendar app will integrate Reminders and Events in iOS 18, I believe Yata still offers significant advantages over the native option:

* **Duration:** Unlike Reminders, Yata allows you to set a duration for your tasks, providing a more detailed time management approach.
* **Differentiate Intent and Due Dates:** Reminders only support a single date/time, making it hard to distinguish between when you want to do a task and its actual deadline. Yata supports both intent and due dates, giving you greater flexibility in planning.
* **Day Templates:** Yata's Routines feature allows you to create customisable day templates that can be easily loaded into your schedule to avoid repetitive setup and save time.

While these missing features might still be acceptable for many users, I hope that you will consider giving Yata a try, especially since it offers a generous free tier and an inexpensive lifetime option!



# Pricing

Yata offers a generous free tier and an inexpensive lifetime option. Currently, the bulk of the app is completely free to use, while certain Pro features are ***literally*** **free to trial** (no need to start a subscription and remembering to cancel). The catch here is that they can only be ""unlocked"" for 24 hours at a time. For example, custom themes will be reset after 1 day of applying it, upon which you can simply reapply the theme for another day of usage. 

Unlimited access to all Pro features can be purchased for just:

* USD 2 per month,
* USD 5 per year, or
* USD 10 lifetime

Please do [check out Yata on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/yata-yet-another-to-do-app/id1631370175), I'd love to hear your feedback and insights to help make the app even better!

I can’t quite explain what is wrong, but maybe the tone and intonations are off?  In a practical example, the speaking seems more difficult to understand, and it’s worse from further away from a device. Do others the new voices an improvement? 

I’ve tried many English language voices, including all US and UK voices, plus some Australia, India, etc. They all sound weird and worse compared with the non-AI versions. After a few days I end up changing because earch voice ends up grating on my ears. Meanwhile, my non AI-capable iPad continues to use the old, better voice.

Hi r/apple!

My first app is a debt and savings tracker that lets you log your debts and savings goals. The UI becomes a dashboard to monitor those debts and savings, with many charts, projections, and calculators integrated into the debts. 

All entered data is saved *only* on the device and in iCloud and is *100% private*. It doesn’t have logins or synchronization with bank accounts, it works offline and doesn’t have a signup to use. 

*Current Features:*

**Debt Manager:**

   - Log 14 types of debt in one place, including credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, and more.
   - Easily add and log debt activity, view detailed progress reports, and plan repayment with a user-friendly interface.
   - See detailed Amortization, Debt Payoff dates, and interest estimations for most debts
   - Asset metadata for Debts: log mortgages to Houses, Cars to loans, student loans to degrees, etc

**Savings Manager:**

   - Log savings goals for downpayments, emergency funds, weddings, home renovations, cars, and much more.
   - Each savings can have multiple sources of funds to log across more than one place (such as savings account, gifts from family or brokerage + savings + physical cash, etc) 
   - Some savings types allow “downpayment” logic. For example, when you save for a car/house, you can save 10,20,50,100% of the total purchase price. 

**No Data Tracking:**

   - DownPay collects no data whatsoever from users, no 3rd party ads, no analytics, etc

**No Subscription:**

   - Free, or One-time Lifetime unlock for unlimited

*Free Version:*

- Log 3 Debts
- Log 2 Savings Goals

In-App Purchases: DownPay Pro

- One-time $15
- Monthly $0.99


**New features built recently:**

- [Detailed Amortization tables & charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosapps/s/u58Mvf0LTc)
- [Paycheck Allocator for debts & expenses](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/s/1SoSvCPdmP)
- [Vehicle Search - USA & International](https://www.reddit.com/r/DownPayApp/s/xUlcbtjcej)
- Hide balances & [*over 20+ currencies*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/s/8JcJBSPpJE)
- In-app requests for new features, currencies, icons, and more

**What I'm building now:**

- Detailed timeline charts
- Enhanced breakdowns
- Expenses & Budgeting
- and more, [view my Roadmap](https://lifeutilityapps.com/downpay/roadmap?isNativeEmbed=true)

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, please comment below 😃 I love implementing suggestions from other Redditors, you all give great feedback! If you enjoy my app please drop an App Store rating, it helps a lot ❤️

The iOS app for anglers, by anglers. Get the Lifetime Pro version for free in the next 72 hours, no subscription required!
",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1gisfr4/logit_the_fishing_journal_the_ios_app_for_anglers/,9,"Hello r/apple!

Today, we, Maik and Daniel, would like to introduce our self-developed app [LogIT](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/logit-the-fishing-journal/id6667102943?l=en-GB). Like many anglers, we also record our fishing days and catches to look back later and learn from them. A handwritten catch diary has always been a hassle, and the existing apps didn't really convince us. So, we decided to develop our own solution in our free time. After about 7 months of hard work, the first version of LogIT is finally available for iPhones and iPads.



What makes LogIT special?

 \- 📒 Organized diary view instead of chaotic catch lists  

\- 📊 Visual statistics – Insightful analysis of your catches  

\- 🖱️ Easy to use and intuitive design  

\- 🌦️ Automatic logging of weather data  

\- ☁️ Data backup – iCloud backup and synchronization  

\- 🚫 No registration required – Start right away, without tedious sign-up processes 

\- ❌ No mandatory subscription  

\- 🛑 Ad-free – No annoying banners or pop-ups  

\- 🎨 Customizable color scheme  

\- 🌙 Dark mode – For comfortable use even at night  

\- 🐟 Quick recording of bycatches in seconds  

\- 🔒 No unnecessary data collection – We respect our users' privacy  



 The best part: The lifetime Pro version of LogIT is completely free for 72 hours! We hope the app will become a helpful companion for many anglers. If you are not into fishing but you may know someone who would benefit from a free logbook feel free to share. Numerous updates and new features are already in the pipeline, and we're excited to hear your feedback!

 Try out LogIT and let us know what you think. A positive review in the App Store would be a huge motivation boost and the cherry on top! Feel free to share the app with your friends. Thanks in advance.

 Tight lines and best wishes, Maik and Daniel 🎣  

 P.S. There’s a small bug: On iOS 17, the “Dive in” button doesn’t work sometimes when the app is first launched. However, closing and reopening the app should fix this. There are no issues on iOS 18. A new update is already published and will soon be online.
