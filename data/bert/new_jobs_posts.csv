At 15, I joined my dad's tobacconist business, but by 23, it closed, and I found myself in the restaurant and fast food industry until 27. Then, I became an office clerk in property management, where I've worked for three years. However, my salary of €1,200 a month is not enough to live independently, buy a house, or start a family. In Italy, supporting a medium-low lifestyle requires at least €2,500-€3,000 monthly. Even with extra hours, I’d only earn €1,800.

I need to make a decision since I can’t stay in this position if I want to achieve my goals. My main aim is to balance work and personal life. I’m considering entrepreneurship but worry about being available 24/7 compared to a regular job where I can disconnect after shifts.

Here are some paths I’m contemplating:

1. Stay in my current field: Become a certified condominium administrator, aiming for €50k annually with flexible hours (3 hours daily and 2 meetings weekly).

2.Change sectors: Work as a restaurant manager (I have a contact) for €35k annually (6 hours daily, 6 days a week), but with 24/7 availability except at night.

3. Open a tattoo studio: Since I'm good at drawing, I could start this venture with an initial income of €35k annually, working 4 hours daily without availability issues.

4. Other options?

ps: Activities I do and love doing in my freetime, playing piano, drawing, gym and fitness, running and biking, and soon more trekking. I have a friend who loved gym and now he is an appreciated fitness instructor in his hometown earning 3k/month. And He truly like what he does.",2024-11-13 10:27:37

I mean back in 2000 when I literally got that salary for tech support, GREAT, the COL was much lower, but now it's not going to cut it to try to get semi-skilled workers and offer them the floor for pay. 

I imagine they do this for people with degrees (I only have an AA), and higher-salaried positions, too, where people would have to take a massive pay-cut to make the switch? Doesn't the whole interview process cost employers money?

""

**CURRENT JOB:**

* Base Salary: $85,000
* Schedule: 2 days office (downtown), 3 days WFH
* PTO: 25 days total
* Location: Downtown (45 min commute each way when in office)
* Schedule reality:
   * WFH days: Wake up 9 AM, start work 9:30 AM
   * Office days: Wake up 7 AM, 45 min commute
   * Losing 2 hours of personal time on office days

**NEW JOB OFFER:**

* Base Salary: $83,200 ($40/hour)
* Schedule: 5 days in office (NO remote)
* PTO: 21 days
* Split location:
   * 3 days town location (22-35 min morning commute, 40-70 min evening)
   * 2 days Downtown (45 minutes each way)
* Must wake up at 7 AM every day (vs 9 AM on current WFH days)
* Overtime available at $60/hour

**BRUTAL MATH TIME**

*Sleep/Personal Time Impact:*

* Current job:
   * 3 days/week: Extra 2 hours sleep/personal time (WFH)
   * 2 days/week: Early wake-up + commute
* New job:
   * 5 days/week early wake-up
   * Annual sleep loss vs current: \~312 hours (3 days × 2 hours × 52 weeks)

*Commute Reality:*

* Current annual commute: 156 hours (2 days × 1.5 hours × 52 weeks)
* New job annual commute:
   * town location: 156-273 hours (3 days × 1-1.75 hours × 52 weeks)
   * Downtown: 156 hours (2 days × 1.5 hours × 52 weeks)
   * Total: 312-429 hours annually in car

*Financial Breakdown:*

* Base salary difference: $ 1,800/year
* PTO difference: -4 days (-$1,308/year)
* Annual car costs (excluding purchase):
   * Insurance: $1,800
   * Registration: $60
   * Maintenance: $800
   * Gas: \~$523
   * Total: $3,183/year

*Break-Even Analysis:*

* Need to make up: $6,291/year (excluding car purchase)
* Required overtime: 315 hours/year
* Weekly overtime needed: 6 hours

**BRUTAL REALITY CHECK:**

1. Time Loss is Massive:
   * Losing 312 hours of sleep/personal time annually
   * Additional 156-273 hours in commute annually
   * Total life impact: 468-585 hours per year (19.5-24.4 full days)
2. Financial Reality:
   * Base pay is worse (-$1,800)
   * Losing 4 PTO days (-$1,308)
   * Need 6 hours overtime EVERY week just to break even
   * That's another 312 hours of your life annually
3. Quality of Life Impact:
   * Going from 2 early wake-ups to 5
   * Trading flexible WFH schedule for rigid office schedule
   * All weather commutes required
   * No flexibility for personal appointments

**HONEST ASSESSMENT:**

You're looking at trading:

* 468-585 hours of your life annually
* $1,800 in base salary
* 4 PTO days
* Schedule flexibility
* Sleep and personal time

To break even, you need:

* 6 hours overtime every week (312 hours/year)
* This means working 45 hours/week minimum
* Adding this to commute time, you're losing \~780-897 hours annually (32.5-37.4 full days)

**RECOMMENDATION:**

Unless this new job offers EXCEPTIONAL career growth potential or you absolutely hate your current role, this is a terrible trade. You're essentially paying them to take more of your time. Even with consistent overtime, you're trading nearly 40 days worth of your life annually for potentially the same or slightly more money.

This isn't just about money - it's about life quality. You're trading:

* Flexible mornings for rigid schedules
* Extra sleep for commute stress
* Personal time for traffic
* WFH comfort for office politics

Unless there's something amazing about the new role's career potential that you haven't mentioned, stick with your current job. The flexibility and time savings of WFH are worth far more than potential overtime pay.

tl;dr: The new job wants you to trade 780-897 hours of your life annually (32.5-37.4 days) for the same or slightly more money. Stay at your current job unless the career growth potential is exceptional.

I got promoted as tax manager in public firm when there is no business case. It’s really something matter me. I’m proud of it.

Then, everybody started left this team to look for their own promotion. Less resources, more workload, more responsibility, being complained more often,… 

When was being at a senior role, i never felt lack of support like this. 

I consulted with my PM aka my boss, the lead of the team. Her advice to me:

- i need to be more resilience and this role will extend my endurance 
- im now in the role of giving support to others, as well as finding my own solution for problems (not seeking from her)
- the higher position i get, the lonelier i will be. Colleagues, friends, the best mates will always leave, so accept it (this is because i feel quite bad since so many of my best colleagues left the firm)
- being emotional is the biggest weakness of a leader
- sale/client facing are something important in business, whatever job i’m gonna do, if i want to be manager level and above, i will need to do that 

At this stage, i guess all of these are true facts that i have to accept. 

So my question is: what I’m facing right now, does it mean i should not be in a Manager role? I should find other job with less stress less pay less responsibilities? Do you have any recommendations? Any advise rn are all appreciated. ",2024-11-13 10:09:41

jobs,1gq8u01,I think ATS is really screwing us over ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gq8u01/i_think_ats_is_really_screwing_us_over/,7,"I used to think it was only the tech industry that is incredibly saturated and difficult to find work right now. Since every tech job posting gets hundreds or thousands of applicants per job post its incredibly difficult to get noticed.
 
So I recently did an experiment and decided to apply for jobs outside of tech and just pivot to different roles far from tech with very low requirements with very very few job applicants. Using linkedin premium I'm able to see how many people have applied to a job. Some of the jobs I'm testing applications on have such low requirements like ""have high school diploma or ged"", ""know how to use Microsoft office"", etc. Basically skills that are bare minimum most people should be able to clear unless you are a criminal felon or homeless dropped out of middle school or something. Some of these jobs only have 3 or 4 applicants only. They should be extremely desperate and accepting anyone who meets bare minimum requirements.

Instead, I was rejected even for those roles. Where basically all you need is a high school diploma. Furthermore, the rejections usually come at random times like the middle of the night so you know it's not a person and it's automated. So my conclusion is the biggest issue we are having with the job market is that ATS is basically just trashing everyone indiscriminately due to missing keywords and stuff on your resume even if you are qualified. On the hiring side, they could also be stressed out not being able to get anyone to interview either since the ATS rejects everyone before being sent to the hiring team so a real human could ever see your application in the first place.

jobs,1gq8mzt,Lost a promotion ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gq8mzt/lost_a_promotion/,2,"

For context I’ve been working at this company as a temp for 4 months through an agency. I’m almost complete with my hours and applied to a different position. I went through the interview process and was given a job offer I signed it the same day I received it. 

I got called into HR today who broke the unfortunate news that my promotion was rescinded. The reason? I had a verbal warning a month prior over tardiness. I’m not mad over that. What I’m honestly upset by is that I went through the interview process and was offered the position. I was told I had 2 weeks til my start date and I’d be moved departments. I received congratulations from my coworkers and managers. Now I’ve got to eat crow. They apologized and said it was an error on their part and that they should’ve looked into it before offering me the job. I was then told that the position will be passed on to someone else and I can reapply if the position opens up in six months. 

6 *months*. I had been so excited over this, I felt like luck was finally shining her light on me. I was worried to be happy too much though. I knew something was going to happen. The other shoe waiting to drop. Again I’m not mad over the verbal warning. That was my own fault and I can blame no one but myself. But to have my hopes dashed, that’s brutal. HR apologized and expressed that they will do better with application screening process so things like this won’t happen again. I think the kicker was that I’d gone in on my day off. I wanted to work OT to get some more hours in to hopefully get to that position faster. I left shortly after that meeting. Why give more of my time to a company that can’t even check if I qualify for the position? So now I’m at home stewing in my own anguish. ",2024-11-13 08:51:06

I do not have dog training experience outside of this and I don’t have much instruction. I do daily walks and training sessions on my own, typically with the same dogs, while my boss does her own thing.

My fiancé and I are moving states. We just bought a home a little over an hour away from our apartment (and my job). Our lease isn’t up for a few more weeks, but we hate it here and want to move.

I don’t need the money. My fiancé makes crazy money, I just do this to keep myself from being bored and feeling useless. My passions are elsewhere and I am working on turning them into a career.

I told my boss over two weeks ago I wanted to leave ASAP. We hate the apartment and want to live in our house. She is working on finding a replacement for me. 

Since then, I’ve just gotten miserable. One of the dogs I walk everyday is suddenly acting out and biting. I am just trying to make it through these next few weeks while she finds a replacement, but I found myself being lectured by her for communicating these issues with the owners. The owners are home everyday and I talk to them more than I talk to my boss.

She came up with a whole new training plan, as well as lecturing me and she wants me to check in with her each time. 

I am just done. I want to live in my house. I’m tired of this job. I’m tired of being expected to be a dog trainer when I’m not and barely have any guidance. I don’t want to go tomorrow and start this new training plan.

On the other hand, she’s been good to me. And I don’t want to mess with her business. It’s 10pm currently, I have to be in at 9am. She doesn’t have anyone to fill my job. I don’t want the dogs to suffer.

I can’t say I wasn’t expecting this, because I was basically begging for them to give me something to do. But I’m still shocked about it.

What happened was that after a week I was in the company, 3 other employees quitted. 
I was kinda worried about the turnover of the company, specially because I was supposed to work with this 3 people. I saw this as a red flag, but didn’t do anything about it.

Then my manager seemed lost, when I asked him how does the strategy work, what are going to be my goals, how do you prefer me to do this task, his answer was always “I’m not sure, I’ll check with the team”.

He gave me some tasks and everytime I finished it, I would ask for more work. At first he tried to give me some tasks, but then he stopped answering my messages and emails.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I tried to work by myself. I was creating new ideas and presenting them to him, but again, with no response.

I even organized an event for networking, and then he suddenly started to respond me again. I was happy with that and after the event ended, I asked him for feedback. I wanted to know the next steps so we could plan other events. But again, I was completely ignored. I started to freak out, thinking that maybe everything went wrong. So I reached out to other employees and they said the event was great.

I just felt so terrible these days, waiting for an answer, scared of being fired, feeling insecure, having anxiety, but at the same time, I was in denial thinking maybe it’s how he was, and that there’s nothing wrong with my job. And then the true finally came: he does not want me in the company anymore.

And the worst thing is that he still ignores me. He didn’t even reached out to fire me. It was the HR that came with the news. 

I’m still trying to understand what happened. He was super friendly at first, and then all of the sudden he just gave me silence. 

I shouldn’t have ignored that first red flag. After that week I should’ve started to look for other jobs, and maybe now I would be working in a decent company.

I'm utterly mortified from embarrassment but also extremely concerned this might cost me a job opportunity. Would really appreciate some advice. 

Received a job offer for a career related opportunity after some months of unemployment. Received the standard drug screening request so I went to a facility near me to get it done. I peed before leaving but was drinking some water on the way to make sure I'd be able to pee when I get there. Mind you, I've never had a problem NOT being able to pee during a drug screening. 

I arrive, check in and after a few minutes of waiting am told to pee in a cup after leaving my phone and keys in a locker. I go in to the restroom and pee on the cup. I end up filling up the cup just below the line the employee marked on the cup. I show it to them and they ask if I can pee a little bit more otherwise they have to dump it. I go back in and try but nothing. I go back outside and tell him I can't do he gives me a bottle of water to drink and tells me to wait until I have to go again

I wait about 25 minutes and I feel like I need to pee again so I give it another try and this time I pee even less than the first time. I'm shocked. This has never fucking happened to me before and I'm wondering what the hell is going on. I go back outside and tell the guy I wasn't able to fill it up again so he gives me another bottle of water which I chug and then go back to waiting. 

After about another 30 minutes, I feel like I'm ready to go for real this time but then I also feel like I need to shit. So I go back in the restroom to try a third time but every time I try to pee I feel like I'm about to shit myself. So I go out and say I can't do it and ask If I can just come back another time but he tells me they don't let anyone leave and they'd have to call my employer. At this point the other employees are looking a little weirdly at me (at least I felt like it) and I was like ""Dude I swear to God I've never done drugs in my life"". 

I then ask if I can use the restroom to shit because I figured if I can do that then I'll be able to pee. He hands me some toilet paper, I drop the load and then after I manage to pee in the cup more than enough. He processes me and I'm out of there after being there for over AN HOUR AND A HALF.

I'm a 18 year old girl from the USA and this was my very first job ever. It was a Korean BBQ place and I was a server. When I applied for the job, they quickly hired me because the place was new and just opened (October 1st) and on the application it said no experience was required. But as I started actually working there it quickly became a problem. I really don't know why but I just couldn't understand anything that was going on. I really did need everything explained to me. From how to check in people,to setting up tables and everything. In Korean BBQ places the server usually cooks the meat and other things on the grill for the customers. It was fine once I got the hang of it but I've never eaten in a place like that before EVER. The managers always expected me to know how to do everything and know what everything is. Like I didn't know anything about alcohol especially shoju. So when I punched it into the machine so the managers could bring it out. They asked me why I ordered two. They began to get mad at me because I didn't know that shoju was a shareable thing. I thought it came in bottles or cups like any other drink. Lol. On my last day (Sunday) the place was really busy and this was my first time ever serving 4 tables at once. I thought I did really bad tbh. I got help from one the the managers the whole night and I honestly thought I was terrible. They funny part is before when I was doing 2 tables I thought I was doing okay. But Sunday was bad. There was one moment that night that sticked out to me. When the main manager was replacing the grease trap on one of the grills. He ask me to bring him one from the kitchen so I did. Then he said ""why didn't you fill it"" thought he just wanted the grease trap. So I filled it with water then I handed it to him. He began getting frustrated because I didn't put it in the grill. I didn't know that I was expected to do all of these things. Since he was cleaning the grill I thought he was gonna fill it up with water and put it in while I was serving other customers. But I just didn't understand anything. So yeah, I and some other guy were fired that same night. They said that we only showed small improvements over time and they weren't looking to train people long term anymore. They let us go and said they'll pay us next week. Since this was my first job I didn't know what was expected of me. But it seems alot more was even tho I didn't have any experience. So I have to ask... are all part time jobs like this? Because I really don't understand what went entirely wrong. Sure I made alot of mistakes but they said no experience was okay. Yet they expected me to know how to do everything without much guidance. I wasn't even told where stuff like the high chairs were or how to do birthday's. When I told this to my parents they were like ""so why did they hire if they obviously didn't want to train the non experienced"" and idk. I really do blame myself alot... but I just hope not all jobs are like this one... I don't want to feel anxiety every time I check in.

There was no way I was not going to negotiate, and there was no way I was not going to sign this DocuSign without knowing any of the benefits. I was shocked to see that the offer was completely lowballed and did not indicate any benefits within the offer or any vacation time. Of course, a few days later thought it over and negotiated the salary and asked to have the benefits and vacation time outline for me. I was then sent the handbook and was shocked at how terrible everything looked. I lost all excitement and had red flags. The Director came back and did not move the ball on salary, which I was disappointed in. I wrote back one last email to him and told him that for it to financially be worth it for me that I needed additional money. Days went by and crickets. I heard nothing from him last week when my start date was supposed to be yesterday. Well on Saturday I looked at my email to see that the DocuSign offer had been rescinded and revoked.

Ok so I am a university student and I was told I wouldn't get a scholarship. This ruined my plans because I usually don't have to work because I get school paid for on top of having a huge disbursement. I hopped onto the first job I can get which was a grocery store. I ended up choosing too many hours having not worked and been in college at the same time. I got it revised but I was still insure of the balancing. I ended up being correct.   It was still too much for me.

I ended up getting an email from the scholarship saying they made a mistake with the calculation and that I would receive it. Now after being overwhelmed with work hours and not being able to keep up with school and now having the scholarship I want to quit. 

This I admit wasn't professional but I didn't show up for my shift and the manager called and asked me if I was coming in. I told him my situation and I said ""I think I want to quit"". I kind of felt like it was bad how I said that so I went to the store to talk to my manager but he went on vacation for a week or 2. I ended up talking to a different manager and he just explained how I ""Did things the wrong way"" (over the phone) and he scolded me a little but told me that if I am willing to work with them and finish out the next 2 weeks my manager would come back in a better mood and more likely to work with me. I think I will just get fired when he comes back tbh. 

I then went to my department. Not on purpose I wanted to get some stuff to buy. I ended up running into my co-workers and they were pist off because now they had to work 10 hour shifts. Understandably so. I felt bad. Then they told me how my manager was even more enraged. After that my coworkers started becoming rude towards me and it felt very uncomfortable and I felt guilty and said I would continue for the 2 weeks. 

Now that I am thinking straight I don't want to cover the 2 weeks because I know my co-workers hate me and I don't want to be around them, School is more important, and this isn't gonna be my career so I don't have bridges to keep. I planned not to say anything and not show up because it would just make things complicated going back on my commitment. Maybe I can come up with a reason for why I cant work anymore? Can I do this? Also, I am thinking it would be awkward to show up in the future because I like to shop there for food sometimes.

Here’s what happened: I was working on a project that required specific measurements. In my previous experiences, I always made sure to confirm setups with my supervisor before taking any measurements. It’s been a habit for me to hold off until I’m confident everything is correct, especially since I’m still learning and want to avoid mistakes.

In this role, though, my supervisor hadn’t specifically asked me to double-check, but I assumed it was the safest approach based on my past experience. Then, in a team meeting with my manager and some colleagues, my supervisor pointed out that I hadn’t completed the measurements yet and implied that I was causing delays. It felt like I got thrown under the bus, especially since I thought I was being responsible by double-checking.

Now I’m worried my manager and team might see me as slow or unreliable which could reflect on the job offer.

Here's the rundown:

\-I'm from the U.S., but I've lived abroad for the past 3 years, working as a freelancer.

\-I'm currently in Thailand, but I plan to move back to the U.S. at the start of 2025.

\-I've started looking for jobs for when I go back, which leads to my question...

  
**What address should I put on my resume/cover letter?**

  
Currently, my resume says ""Chiang Mai, Thailand (until January 2025)"" at the top, and I usually put my full Thai address at the top of my cover letter. One paragraph towards the end of my cover letter briefly explains the bullet points above.

I'm debating changing this to ""\[Hometown, State\] (from January 2025)"" and putting my home address on my cover letter instead, because I haven't been getting any positive responses to my applications even for positions I'm overqualified for. I get that it's a tough market right now but that's exactly why I want to optimize my chances.

The phone number on my resume is also Thai (+66) so screening calls are unlikely. Should I just remove this?

  
How would you approach this? Or should I just not apply to jobs until I get back to avoid this issue altogether?

Next year will be my 10 year anniversary in my company. I work in customer support for a software company. During this period, I have seen a few rounds of layoffs, the company getting acquired, covid 19 etc. My department was spared each time but I still cannot get used to seeing an email from the CEO the first thing you log in that suggests I may be losing my job.

In the past I can sort of see it coming. For instance when the company I worked for need to downsize and when the company got acquired, I knew there will be people getting let go. But because we have to look after existing customers, my department did not experience any layoffs.

It feels different this time round. new CEO, announced reorganization the moment he got the job. And after about a year, started talking about plans to expand the company's footprint in India. During this period there were lay offs happening in other departments, but there are constant reassurances that our department will not be touched because our department is already running lean. And the latest email is now confirming the decision to open an office in India and relocating roles. This seems like cost cutting to me, not expansion. Shortly after that email, everyone in our department is having a meeting with the department head the next day to confirm if we are getting let go.

She told me to get some nonslip shoes at walmart and some blue pants because that's what they wear, and to bring my id and sse back sunday (11/10 and she said come at anytime) When I went up there sunday, the manager copied the cards and told me that the hiring manger came in at 1pm and that she was going to call me.

It's tuesday and I still haven't heard back from anyone yet. Why did the hiring manager say I can start work tuesday (today) and why did the manager say that the hiring manager was going to call me sunday. I got an email and text saying I was hired the day I did my interview and completed the onboarding tasks btw School ends at 4pm for me",2024-11-13 00:45:57

jobs,1gq0dve,Do I stay or do I go?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gq0dve/do_i_stay_or_do_i_go/,0,"Good job hunting to all, 

This is based in the UK. I am in a unique situation I haven't been in before and looking for advice - I'm in a niche job sector with 8 years of experience and doing a mid to high level role, I just turned thirty. 

So I was absolutely smashing work in the first half of the year and I recently got an opportunity to do a Government project through a prestigious engineering firm based in the south west of the country. So, I sold everything and moved out west, I signed an 18 month fixed term contract and the pay is v good. 

3 days after I moved the project got cancelled and this happened back in July. Thanks Government, I just signed a 12 month lease on a cute little flat to do this work. 

The company have kept me on and i just take orders from my manager and I have been writing reports from home, although this isn't the job that I was offered and it's quite hard and I have struggled so my manager extended my probation for another 6 months. 

My manager has been telling me to look for another job as the work I'm currently doing is going to run out and she isn't sure what they are going to do with me, it's an absolutely huge company and we have been in touch with HR but they haven't told me what's going to happen if they can't find any work. 

My CV is currently in circulation within the company and there might be more work for me, but it is a very niche thing that I do, so the likelihood of that happening is slim, especially as my manager has quoted saying ""you're not ready for that, it's too high level for you"" when another project within the company had arised. Which I guess is fair enough, my manager was the one who recruited me and the idea was to train me up during this project so I could do these things as the role at this project was very different to hers and something I would have aced. 

My contract is decent but states if I'm within my probation I have a weeks notice if I'm going to be dismissed, so naturally I have been looking for other jobs - I have a few interviews lined up next week but I think I'll be paid like 25% less than I have been here. 

I haven't been here long so I haven't got any rights to compensation if they get rid of me, but due to the circumstances, I feel like I could at least ask? Like I moved out here and spent a lot of money to do so and I know they have been heavily compensated by the Government for the cancellation.   
  
So should I wait until they give me this notice? And how could I ask? I've always been decent at work and never been let go or anything tbf so have no idea how the process works. 

Do I stay or do I go?",2024-11-13 00:42:49
jobs,1gpv1l0,Advice needed - toxic upper-management,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gpv1l0/advice_needed_toxic_uppermanagement/,2,"Hey everybody,

I’m currently interning at a fashion company in Netherlands. I’ve had a few unpleasant incidents with my manager and manager’s manager in which i will briefly explain here.


On my first day, and considering that i had commuted 3 hours to reach the office, i was hungry, i read/heard from some-body/where that the company does offer lunch and for breakfast you’d have to pay. I ask around and find that the kitchen is downstairs, i go downstairs, i ask the kitchen staff if they serve breakfast to which they replied no. To which i reply okay and headback upstairs. Situation ends here, well atleast from my side. 

Another day, i was also a bit hungry and had asked for a 2nd portion from the canteen staff, they said they don’t do 2nd portions. I just leave it at that.


Kitchen staff then goes to my manager’s manager and complains about me, saying that i demanded them to make me breakfast, i said that there food was shit to the lunch-lady and demanding 2nd portions. Manager A decided to put the whole blame on me, said that this is company policy and that i’m going against company policy. 

On another instance, i asked the lunch lady if she can give me an extra scoop, to which she replied no, i then asked her why not? It’s just a scoop not portion, she says “you can make things difficult but you’re not getting another scoop” she then starts shouting, takes her gloves off and throws away and goes downstairs, presumably to complain. I go to my manager, explain the situation, to which he goes to manager A and manager A decided to talk to me again about that incident, tried to remind me of “old mistakes” and said that she’d be embarrassed to take me with a client. 

Manager A as a person is the typical narcissistic, unappreciative, i-know-it-all attitude with unbelievable ego. I want to get revenge because this b*tch is trying to irritate me in any way possible and the fact the way she made me feel no other person should feel it. 

After these instances, my manager decided to give me the most mundane, analytical and no-learning-opportunity tasks. He wants me to analyze around 20k+ products individually. Every single week. He is also trying to delay the only task in this internship that you actually are able to learn something by burying me with bullshit tasks that have no value-added. 

I’m actively trying to switch jobs and applying vigorously. However, before i leave i have to get my revenge on this b*tch. Do you guys have tips on how i can do that?

I interviewed with the team manager and director pretty quickly and it seemed like they basically needed to hire a team immediately within the next two weeks bc a new drug had been put on the market by that company. I obviously did not anticipate on needing such a quick turnaround time that was not flexible especially because I needed to give my own employer advance notice/I had several weeks left on a service agreement for tuition remission. In addition to the logistics not working out, they extended the territory for that job to a very large area that I was not comfortable taking. Declined the job and they were very nice about staying in touch in the future. Once I was ready to make a jump, even if it wasn’t a position like that.

The other day, my employer had a bunch of people quit, and there’s a little bit of a threat of reorganization internally, which I really do not align with. Is it weird if I reach back out to that hiring manager to see if they have other positions open or if he knows of internal colleagues who are hiring at the moment? I have his email and cell. I already emailed the original recruiter who was super sweet and responded quickly and said she isnt covering my region but connected me with the new recruiter who is.

My plan was to move in with a relative who lives in another state as there are far more jobs in my field over there compared to where I live. It is close to non existent here. My first job was through a temp agency (in my field) but it was temporary. I've been keeping tabs on the few temp agencies we have around here for more but I haven't been successful at all. This includes the few jobs about my field I could find (not from temps). My plan to move to better my situation was cut short because I recently got MRI results for headaches I've been having. Not exactly good results. I won't be able to afford for the care I need over there. 

But I don't want to sit around doing nothing. I want to at least save up money and maybe I can move by myself to increase my job outlook and won't have to depend on others. Instead of focusing on searching for jobs in my field, I want to start looking for jobs to save up. How easy is it to get a job as a cashier? I see a few listings near me. My experience is practically zero for anything that doesn't have to do with what I studied... My problem isn't enough to keep me from working (but I do need care) and I pray it stays that way.

jobs,1gpza9h,"Recently graduated with my bachelor's, but I still can't find work inside OR outside of my degree field in my local area. What might I be doing wrong?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gpza9h/recently_graduated_with_my_bachelors_but_i_still/,0,"I \[28m\] graduated college at the end of 2023 with a B.S. in Environmental Science. For some extra context, I'm in the U.S. and I live in the state of Florida with my parents. We currently live in the panhandle region of the state, and in a pretty rural area at that. I did go to a university in Pensacola and I did spend a fair amount of time living on-campus there, but aside from that I've lived with my family in our current area for the past 8 years or so. I doubt any of that will be relevant to most people reading this, but I figured I should include it just incase someone who is from the area or has at least lived here in the past decided to chime in with some insights on the local job market or something.

Anyway, it's been almost a year since I've graduated and I still haven't landed a job yet. I think most of it can be chalked up to the fact that there's just not that much of a demand for someone with my specific degree in this part of Florida. I mean, I can still try for positions that employers are looking to fill with someone that has a background in the general sciences/natural sciences (i.e. geology, biology, chemistry, etc.), but most people don't SPECIFICALLY need *Environmental* scientists from what I can tell. And even when I do find job postings that line up with my education or background, they're looking for people to fill mid- or senior-level positions. They rarely have entry-level positions for recent college grads like me. To be fair, this makes sense, as most of the panhandle of Florida consists of tourist towns/cities on or near the beach, so the local job market doesn't have much diversity to it. Most of what's available is just tourism/hospitality/retail, etc etc.

At this point, I figure I have two options. I can either  
A) Try to be patient and continue waiting to see if I CAN find an entry-level job that will allow me to get my foot in the door in my field  
B) Just grab whatever low/minimum wage, no experience needed type of job I can find and start saving up to move to a different city that has better job opportunities for me

Obviously Option A hasn't been working out for me. I've been trying Option B but I'm not having much luck with that either. I have a couple of theories as to why that is, but it's hard to say for sure. For starters, I don't really have much in the way of work experience or qualifications I can put on my resume aside from the degree itself and maybe some of the key/most valuable skills I picked up from my college courses (i.e. I have some skills in technical writing and communication from writing lab reports and research papers, I have some experience working in a lab and doing chemistry and whatnot, I've dabbled in GIS software. You get the gist of it). I also participated in a sort of work-study program for a semester where worked part-time under a professor, helping him with research and scientific literature reviews...but I have a feeling most employers wouldn't see that as a ""real job"".

But other than that, my resume leaves a lot to be desired. I can't really speak to any work experience because I barely have any. I did work a few retail jobs shortly after high school, but I ended up quitting each of those jobs after only a few weeks because I used to have really bad social anxiety and other mental health issues, and the heavily customer-facing nature of those jobs really got to me. So I've always been told not to include those jobs on a resume because they just make me look bad given how quickly I quit them. Aside from that, most of my 20s have been spent going to college full-time, not working.  
(And if you're wondering how I spent that many years in college and didn't graduate until the age of 28...it's a long story. Though I'd chalk most of it up to the fact that I initially started college while living in a different state and had to leave when my parents decided to move us to Florida, and then had to wait a long time before re-enrolling because of not being eligible for financial aid for a good while after moving. I also switched majors after re-enrolling)

So, to recap:  
\> The job market in my area doesn't offer many opportunities in my degree field (Though I do want to make it clear that I don't regret majoring in my field, despite how frustrating the job hunt is). The few opportunities that do exist are not for fresh college grads like me.  
\> I want to get a ""normal"", no-education-needed type of job so I can save up to move elsewhere, but I fear my lack of work experience outside of college is a turn-off to employers  
\> What little pre-college work experience I DO have is not something I can mention due to how poorly it reflects on me. Also, while I have been in therapy working on myself and maturing since then, I'd be lying if I said I was completely over my anxiety and other issues. Even when applying for jobs, I've found myself biased towards positions that require less customer interaction (or at the very least, a lower volume of customer interaction. For example, when I've applied to Walmart in the past, I've applied for like...shelf-stocking positions or positions working in inventory/back-of-store). Conversely, I've mostly avoided applying to work at places that are just PURE retail/customer-facing work.

I've gotten some advice from family and friends, but I'm not sure what's helpful and/or accurate. I've had some people tell me to just stop whining about social anxiety, suck it up, and get a retail job...which I've been trying to avoid but I think I WILL eventually do that if I feel like I have no other options.  
Some folks have also suggested that the reason I'm not hearing back from any employers (Even from places that supposedly hire anyone, like Walmart and other big box stores) is because most places have some sort of automated system that sorts through online applications and filters out any resumes that don't have key words that they're looking for.

And on the off-chance that a hiring manager does actually lay eyes on my resume, they might end up passing me over because I'm overqualified. As in they might think ""Oh, he's a college kid. He's probably expecting a way higher pay than what we're offering just because he has a degree"". Which isn't true tbh, I'll take pretty much anything I can get at this point even if the pay isn't great. But a hiring manager that's having to sort through hundreds of applications wouldn't know that just from looking at my resume, nor would they have the time to care.

So yeah, I'm feeling kinda stuck, and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I also do want to apologize for letting this turn into a rant/vent. I guess I did need to let some frustrations out. But I'd still appreciate whatever advice anyone has to give.  
Like, is there maybe a way to make my resume more appealing to the kinds of places I'm applying for? Should I just skip online applications entirely and just go into town to see if local businesses are hiring? I've been using the well-known job posting sites that everyone recommends (i.e. Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor) as well as websites for both state government jobs and federal government jobs, but there could be other job-seeking avenues I haven't considered.  
Is there some remote work I might be qualified for? I've looked at remote jobs every now and then but most positions I find also require some amount of experience. I know there are some types of jobs that don't require any (i.e. Data Entry) but I've been told that there's a huge demand for those jobs but not a lot of openings to go around. Like, everyone and their mother wants a job in remote data entry but not many companies actually need people for that position anymore. Not to mention most postings you see for them are just scams anyways.

Idk, I think I'm starting to ramble at this point. I realize I have different approaches I can try, I just have NO idea what might stick and what might be a waste of time.",2024-11-12 23:52:09

It’s not that corporations or senior executives are unethical per se, it’s just that **it’s in their best interest for you to believe in ethics**, and they are playing the game. And the Patriots definitely were a team not known for their ethics lol.

Why can't we (job seekers) play the same game? Telling you not to lie, that you need to come into the office to ""collaborate"", and preventing you from OE **are executives just doing their job...** but they don't actually believe it at all. They just have to pretend to believe it.

The people/company are fine - the work itself is very boring. I often find myself wondering what to do with my time and feeling sort of useless. I did change from a very fast paced, busy field into a slower one. Already feeling burnt out from being uninterested in the work.

I was contacted today for an interview in my old field (was not applying - was headhunted through old work contacts). Pay/benefits would certainly be better and I know I would enjoy the work more. 

I feel bad taking this interview and am not sure how to approach it after having just started this new role. Do I even mention it?",2024-11-12 23:14:57

I am an aviation major and aspire to be a commercial pilot in the future. Flight training to this level can get as costly as $100k+ and I definitely don't have that kind of money. My father and I opted to get loans for these fees (so far around $30k) and try to pay the semesters primarily out of pocket in order to not get into even crazier debt. They aren't too expensive (approximately 7k a semester/14k a year AFTER financial aid), but my current on-campus job isn't able to carry the weight of these costs, so it has been eating into my savings that I worked for in high-school. 

I have a large culinary background, both in front and back of house, as well as exceptional customer service skills.

I quit my customer service job about a week ago to start a job for Morgan Stanley in another customer service role. The role requires you to be licensed by FINRA and the first four months are spent training and learning so you can obtain the licenses needed. Employment is contingent on passing the exams to receive the licenses. Upon getting into the role and material, I realized I’m not interested in the material and the training is too fast paced and rigorous for me. Per my post history, I’m concerned if I can even pass the first exam we are due to take in a month because the material is so rigorous. Because of this, I reached out to my old job to see if they would hire me back. I was only at the job for about 3 months and the role does have high turnover. But when I took the job, I had been looking for months and that’s all I could find at the time. I’m also applying for other roles as well since I really need employment and money to get back on track financially. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. If I don’t pass the first exam at my current job, it’s highly likely I’ll be fired or have my pay reduced while I continue to try to study for the exam again all within a month’s time. I really think the job is a mismatch for my skills and experience since I largely have a marketing background, but they liked that I had some financial services experience because I used to work for a financial services brand. It’s just been tough finding a marketing job, so that’s why I started to focus on customer service roles so I could get by. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? ",2024-11-12 22:48:07

So I started this new job. It's in the industry that my degree is in but it isn't directly the job that I wanted, it's sort of adjacent. I wanted to be a graphic designer or work with designs and I am essentially the printer of the design work. I finished my degree last spring and this is genuinely my first full time job as an adult on my own, thus my daily life has shifted greatly. 

Previously I worked part time from 9 AM until 5 PM. Now I'm waking up at 5 AM, to work 7 to 3. The hours aren't terrible its just getting up so early that has me soured. I've gotten used to it but it could be more ideal.

Week 1 was fine. It was sort of getting into the weeds with things and picking up what I'm doing. There are a LOT of tasks. Last week my day to day seemed to be print out a project, package it, rinse and repeat until about 1 PM and then I'd do the mail for the facility. I was getting the hang of most of it, printing the more complicated stuff I felt like I needed to be in a more hands on training situation for but figured I'd get there. This week, it was more of that but then other things thrown at me at well and I haven't had time to refine any of it. So I feel overwhelmed, as if I'm starting to drown in the work already because they seem to expect me to just know it...

For example, I had to use a paper cutter today. A giant piece of heavy machinery with a hydraulic press that cuts thick stacks of paper. I get the basics of it but there are specific measurements and it seems off or something because the dimensions are never cut right for me. There seems to be some finessing. So I messed up three times before I grabbed the other person in my dept, my senior, and I was like yeah listen I am not getting this right I really need help. So she had no problem coming to help me but then we're immediately learning something new WHILE I'm trying to learn this still. And the skills are meant to carry over. Additionally, I'm learning EVEN MORE TASKS and then being told that tomorrow I'll be learning something else! It's a lot!

I'm sure part of it is just getting into the groove and picking it up, I mean she once was new too...but man I feel like I'm struggling with the training and I'm not doing great. What the hell do I do??",2024-11-12 22:45:40

I used to work on farms but can no longer do heavy labor like I used to. And the few jobs I had, I got fired from or nearly got fired from so I can't really put them on a resume. I'm looking for ideas for jobs that I can do with my limitations that will also give me a lot of job security. I don't mind going back to school to get certifications but I only have enough money left in my college fund for maybe \~4ish semesters. I'm in the USA.

Limitations:

* can't do a lot of heavy lifting, bending over, or anything that would put too much strain on my joints (worst joints are my shoulders)
* can't drive (public transportation is readily available where I live)
* also have some learning disabilities; I mostly struggle with math & understanding unclear instructions/expectations
* also struggle to read diagrams/graphics
* autistic, which causes me to become easily overwhelmed in social situations or in environments with a lot of sensory stimuli
* struggle with teamwork

Strengths:

* very good at noticing details
* really good dexterity with my hands & fine motor tasks (I'm a collage artist and am VERY skilled with an x-acto knife)
* good eye for visual layouts/design
* empathetic, compassionate; good emotional intelligence
* enjoy & am really good at public speaking
* great grammar & a good proofreader

Preferences:

* would prefer something predictable; I like repetitive tasks & can get through them quickly once I get into a rhythm
* I work best in small groups or alone with a high degree of accountability from someone else
* want something that has good job security in the future even if the pay isn't great
* if I need to get additional schooling, would prefer not to be in school for longer than 2 years if possible
* would enjoy working night shifts (I am practically nocturnal)
* something I can start doing part-time before I transition into full-time hours

I’ve told my manager and they’ve “had a word” but this isn’t the first time they’ve “had a word”. This person has a history of being like this. 

Now, our manager is leaving. They’ve not officially left but they’re taking their holiday now and I presume they’ll leave once they get back. Should I tell my managers manager about what’s going on?

Hey guys! Currently working facility maintenance for a university, but the pay just isn’t there for me. I’m trying to move up the ladder but all I get is months worth of waiting for a reply then an automated email saying I don’t meet the qualifications. I’ve tried going back to school but can’t juggle the schedule of part time school with full time work (plus the occasional OT and being on-call for my job). So those of you who can juggle it, I applaud y’all!

At the university I work at, I truly feel like the maintenance department is discriminated against. Most the employees truly don’t like us. We’re always looked down upon. When I apply to other jobs within the university, I swear having “maintenance” on my resume is actually hurting me. I’ve been told by several co-workers that my degree isn’t a “real engineering degree” or that “[my] degree is no good anymore since [I] haven’t used it”. (Note, this has never been told to me by upper management or in a hiring process)

I’ve worked as a full time facility maintenance for about 6 years now. I did it right out of college because it was an easy job to get hired to. It allowed me to travel around out west (USA) since I could work contract work for the hotel operations inside national parks. Now I’m looking to do something else. A career that actually pays over $25/hr but has potential of making more later.

Since it’s been a hot minute since I’ve dealt with the things I learned in college, so I won’t say I’m “proficient” in anything, but i definitely have knowledge with CADD, GIS, Python, electrical work, plumbing, solar energy, almost anything mechanical too, carpentry, the works. Ive tried applying field a field engineer position for oceanography research implements, and a CNC machinists mainly. I like the idea of my boss handing me blueprints or a work order and then I get it handled. I’ve tried rotating shift work in an industrial setting and couldn’t stand it; the night shifts fucked with my depression way too much. I don’t mind working a shitty shift from time to time, but not rotating night shift.

What are some options for me to look for? Whats hot right now for mechanical engineering grads? Searching on indeed is a shit show. Their algorithm for what jobs it shows you is just awful.

That being said, I am the longest tenured employee. We have had a high turnover rate but we have a strong team now.

A year ago, I was promoted from Office Assistant to Ministry Coordinator with a $2/hour raise. The new role focuses on supporting program and event coordination, managing projects, and collaborating with our team on communication tasks. However, the leadership team with approval from my new supervisor (not a new coworker, my old supervisor just stepped into a different role) recently added several office assistant-type responsibilities back to my workload, such as stocking and ordering supplies, keeping the office kitchen clean, and managing snacks and drinks.

These tasks were part of my previous assistant role, and I was under the impression my promotion would shift me away from these duties. Now, I feel like I’m balancing two roles without adequate compensation or recognition of the shift in focus my promotion was supposed to bring. I’m struggling with feeling undervalued and am wondering if I should bring this up to my manager again or if my frustration is misplaced.

My first thought is to ask for different compensation - but my old supervisor requested a raise for me a few months ago (unrelated situation, she liked me work and wanted to compensate me for it) and that was denied because it “wasn’t in the budget”. They have tried to hire a new office assistant but were unsuccessful and are no longer hiring for it.

Any advice on how to approach this situation or advocate for either more pay or a clearer boundary between the roles or offer any perspective that I’m not seeing would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR; Old responsibilities pre-promotion were put back on my plate. Feeling undervalued and unheard. They discuss wanting me to flourish and grow in my career, then do this. Need advice.",2024-11-12 21:19:19

Get fired for that, exboss said on recording he would still pay me PTO in check on Monday this was all Friday. (Yday was Veterans Day) today, He took off my direct deposit on payroll today and is telling me that the payroll system won’t “Process the payroll and can’t run in middle of cycle” that I would get paid next pay cycle. I informed him he took me off direct deposit (i was informed via email) and he stuck with the same story. Two questions, 1. for said payroll system is the docotors not MANDATORY to pay out PTO as he owns the company i was working for? 2. Is this correct in what he’s saying even tho it’s not direct deposit it’s a physical check I have to wait until next pay period? Thank u!",2024-11-12 21:01:21

i’m usually quite calm but there’s alot to take in, alot to learn about specifics and such. theres one colleague who seems unimpressed with what i do. i make a mistake and she says to me “didn’t you learn this already?” “you should’ve learned this in training” (i only had 2 days trainin) “i already showed you this”. but i don’t want to blame her but its such a mood killer for me because it’s basically a backhanded compliment. i always find myself rushing to impress not just my colleagues, but mainly myself. it’s just how i’ve always been. i set such high standards for myself that i expect myself to have everything to a t as soon as possible and get pissed off when i mess up or i don’t know a certain thing. a perfectionist. after every shift i’ve had i go home stressed out and kick myself cause i messed up and how i didnt know this or how i should’ve handled that.

i’m jealous at how my coworkers can just talk to customers with knowledge and natural. i also hate how they just come and take over from what i’m doing and just sell better than i do. it genuinely hurts me and my ego and pisses me off how they can just do it and i cant, even though i dont know much of the products. i want to just do my own thing but i need constant assistance for product knowledge. now that we’re getting to christmas time i need to learn things as quickly as possible.

My daughter lost her first job after the training period was over. They said she needed more training and they were going into a downturn and couldn't afford to keep her on. Anyway, I told her to leave them off of her resume when applying to the next place and to not mention her previous job and to tell them she hadn't worked before if they asked (because previous employer wouldn't be able to give her a good recommendation). 

  
Anyway, she tried applying to Kohl's but they had language in the application that asked about previous employment and mentioned penalty under perjury. So we backed out of that one. Her next (pending) place was Burlington and she said she hadn't had previous employment before in the interview, but then had to fill out a background check and put ""no"" for previous employment. We haven't gotten word back and it's been several days. I'm pretty sure they found she had worked before and that's what's causing the hang up. I'm worried I've screwed her. It's been forever since I was first job hunting and it was common then to not mention a first job you were fired from. 

  
She's adhd and undiagnosed Autistic (I'm pretty sure) and the poor kid may have gotten screwed by mom's bad advice. Are we just suppose to have her list previous employment she was fired from, knowing that might cause her to not get hired at another place? ",2024-11-12 18:09:11

The offer is 20/hr part-time for 3 months then they decide if they want me (internship-esk; the guy told me that everyone there followed in my footsteps; I did confirm with employees that were there). It’s a 5-minute drive to the office. I also still need to do a last-round CEO interview for a remote Backend Software Engineering internship but it was unpaid for a startup (seed). I figured I could do both IT & Backend Software Engineering during the 3 months with the potential to get hired for the startup, or continue with the IT and eventually grow into a systems administrator. Eventually pivoting into Dev Ops, later landing a Software Engineering position.

I recently decided to leave the company and go out on my own.  My biggest source of anxiety is the actual resigning part.  The company has been good to me and my family, but the type of work and office environment is not what I want for myself.

There are some complications that come with me leaving:

\-The state requires that companies ""practicing architecture"" have a qualifying agent who is a licensed Architect.  I can still stay on as the qualifying agent even if I leave, but I would have to remain a corporate officer.  I would also expect some compensation for acting as qualifying agent, though I'm not sure what to ask for (5% of profits?)

\-I get profit sharing, though it's not done in a very official manner (part of why I'm leaving), so I am planning on waiting till I get my Q4 payout in January before I resign, as there is some concern the owner may try to withhold this if I resign sooner.  This money is part of what I'm using for startup costs, but it still feels a bit shady bolting as soon as I get paid.

\-I have a very heavy workload, and me leaving is going to really hurt the company.  I want to make the transition as easy as possible, but I'm not sure about offering more than 2 weeks' notice, especially if the owner takes my leaving badly (he's a narcissist, so he probably will take it personally).

jobs,1gpoycj,Is HR for someone like me? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gpoycj/is_hr_for_someone_like_me/,8,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old psychologist who graduated about a year ago. Since then, I’ve been struggling to figure out my career path. I’ve been considering HR as an option, but I’m torn because I’ve never seen myself working in the corporate world. I only have experience working in government jobs and npo's and I want to be a clinical psychologist but there has been some hardships. Also there are no other job listings other than corporate jobs and it feels like HR could be a good option because of my psychology background.

To be honest, one of the main reasons I don’t like corporate culture is because it feels like rebranded capitalism. It’s presented as corporations wants to create value in the society, but beneath the surface, it often feels like it’s all about profit. Workers put in so much effort to create value, but the majority of the benefits go to those at the top. On top of that, workers can be replaced or laid off at any time because, at the end of the day, corporations prioritize profits over people. This doesn’t sit well with me, and I wonder if it would make me feel disillusioned in an HR role.

That said, I do care deeply about helping people and fostering growth, and I think HR could be a way to do that. I’m empathetic, curious, and good at problem-solving, and I’ve always been drawn to roles that involve supporting others. I’m also goal-oriented and a bit of a perfectionist, which has its pros and cons when it comes to work.

I’d love to hear from people who work in HR:

Is it possible to do meaningful, people-centered work in HR despite the corporate context?

Do you feel like HR can challenge or reshape the profit-first mindset of corporations, or does it just reinforce it?

What kind of mindset, values, or skills do you think someone like me would need to thrive in HR?

I’m also open to suggestions for alternative career paths that align with my values and psychology background. 
Thanks for any insights you can share.

I have over 20 years of experience in finance, in a very wide range of roles: bookkeeping, analysis, management, controlling and so on. I have a basic to intermediate understanding of blockchain technology, mainly because I focus on finance, I don’t get too technical in my learning. The thing is that I’ve been applying for the last 6 months to every finance job out there, I couldn’t even get a interview. I’ve been talking to financial analysts in some of those companies, I know what they do, I used to supervise that. So, I don’t know what is it, the little feedback I got was:

1- Not the right country (Argentina, similar US time, but needed to actually be in the US)

2- Not the right experience (asked for crypto experience or banking)

3- Overqualified (entry-level jobs)

4- Not the right tools (Python, I’m in finance, not in coding, but I learn it if I need it, like every other tool I’ve learned before)

I hit every deadline and even got a few titles within my department with substantial authority.

Ever since I’ve been with the competitor that snatched me I’ve lost all faith in my ability to do my job and am constantly falling behind due to the amount of work I’ve been allotted and lack of resources to properly do my job.

My assistants aren’t highly skilled and make numerous mistakes but in the end I’m the one that gets a hand slapped for the delays caused by me asking for corrections. I don’t redirect any praise for my work even when it’s great… just a “good job but make sure you do more” type vibe whenever I have something that seems like a huge success.

I moved for this job and found my significant other during my time in this new city. We’ve moved in with each other and I’m feeling the need to find employment elsewhere and maybe in a different field. I constantly feel like I’m failing and I dread heading into the office or logging in from home.

(E.I.T.), which I have 2 applicable y.o.e. I thought this would be a great opportunity, since they listed out the salary range for each individual city that you could apply for and the range was 25%-50% raise. With this in mind, I figured I would get a 35% raise with my experience (2/5 years). 

I applied for a city across the country (I had my reasons for that specific city), and had several great interviews. I had great repertoire with the managers, great experience, recruiter interactions went well. When they told me on my last interview they were getting ready to send me an offer, I started planning out how to move there.

The problem started when I asked the recruiter to confirm the salary range just before the second interview. She said it was accurate, but that the upper range was for another, higher certified engineer (P.E.) and more years of experience. I thought that was weird since they listed the level in the JOB TITLE, but I told her my expectations and she said she would see what she could do.

Turns out, they offered below the salary range due to ""internal team equity and not wanting to ruffle feathers in the existing team"".  It still would've been a 20% raise, but I didn't really have a lot of faith in the company anymore. Having 2 y.o.e. in their specific position they told me was hard to fill, only to get offered under the confirmed salary range, left me with a sour taste in my mouth that won't have me moving across the country trusting they're a good employer.

Do you think I was wrong in turning this down? I didn't want to risk moving with a company like that, and I'm currently using the offer for salary negotiations with my current company for maybe a 10-11% raise.

Even concert tickets (basically to go anywhere or plan anything I need my boss's persmission first) I am stuck with 7 tickets because she wouldn't approve my leaveto attend a concert for a date in December because that's when we have our Office Christmas Party (apparently nobody has ever missed the christmas party and everyone is required to attend and cannot leave early.)

I spoke with my old boss in the Department of Education and they'll willingly take me back no question asked so long as I apply for the next vacat position.

Been here for almost 8 years after graduating with an English degree. Not super passionate about it or anything, but it’s stable, pays slightly above market rates, relatively low stress, and fully remote.

My girlfriend is in her last year of medical school and is applying to residency programs on both the west + east coasts, with high preference for California (her home state). We won’t know until March 2025 where exactly we’ll end up moving to in late May/early June. On a personal note, I love CA: great food, weather, vibes. On a professional note, my company for some annoying tax-related reason allows remote work from 49 of the United States, barring CA as the sole exception. So if she ends up getting a residency in CA (which she really wants) then I’ll be FORCED to quit my job. I love her and plan to move with her regardless of where we go, but as the time draws nearer I’m getting severe anxiety about not being able to find a job. 

If we end up not going to CA, I could keep my current job indefinitely or at the very least keep it while I job hunt for better/local opportunities. If we end up having to go to CA, I’m so scared of not being able to find a job WHILE unemployed. 

TL;DR: how is the job market for someone with 8 years of communications/corporate writing experience? I haven’t started looking yet, with vague plans to start after the new year.

For that reason, I don’t have any issue with people using AI, BUT

After a few months of playing around with ChatGPT for cover letters, I definitely recognise patterns in how it writes. I feel as though if I was a hiring manager, I could probably recognise a ChatGPT written application with pretty high accuracy. 

The best luck I’ve had is by basically writing a quick cover letter draft with bullet points for what I want to say, and asking ChatGPT to modify that, rather than asking it to generate something completely original. Even then, it loves to pepper in words like “honed” and “fostered” and add a summarising sentence to the end of every paragraph, which I feel like gives it away. 

So, then, what is that sweet spot between using AI to speed up the process of writing a tailored cover letter, without immediately giving it away.

Also, a question to employers: would you choose a cover letter that while clearly written by a human, is not as “professional” sounding, or a very “professional” sounding cover letter that hints at possibly being AI written?

But on a number of job applications I included references from past intern and part time job supervisors without asking them permission.

I did this partly because I already asked them for LinkedIn references- that they delivered and I thought it was fine to just go ahead and put them on. I also did this because I had the misconception it wasn’t a big deal and they wouldn’t mind as they likely get used as references all the time.

Only recently for a job did I reach out ahead of time to ask them for consent if they are comfortable with me using them as a reference and one of my references agreed to it but informed I need to get their permission. I don’t know how I was so thoughtless and inconsiderate. 

Since I’ll need to contact my references every time I want to apply to a new job, I’m not sure what to do now.

Please help.",2024-11-12 06:16:22

During my internship, I worked hard on my project for two months, often staying up until 2 AM after coming back from the office. The work culture in the company became so toxic that I wanted to quit halfway through. They never reviewed my code, and if the client found any issues, I was blamed, which was really frustrating. Despite the challenges, I managed to complete my internship and received a job offer with a 3 LPA salary. However, the company has a 6-month probation period, and if I want to leave, I need to serve a 2-month notice period.

After much thought, I decided not to continue with the offer because the experience left me mentally exhausted and demotivated. It's been a month now since I rejected the offer, and I've been looking for a new job. I'm also considering doing another internship, but I’m thinking it might be better to spend the next 3-4 months focusing on improving my skills and then applying to better companies to increase my chances of getting hired.

I want to relieve my mind and hopefully someone gets good laugh like my friend did. 

I was in Teams interview for internal position (position which I have no formal education) with HR, hiring manager and third person. Everything went well, my english was bit rusty as I don’t use it on regular basis but when they started to go on more technical questions, I started to stutter more and then I felt diaphragm (the organ in the stomach) sort of like cramped. Then I felt like I’m gonna throw up, it went a way and then came back. It felt horrible! Conversation didn’t provide good place to assert that I’m nervous but I think they saw it and they steered to conversation a bit to give time space to breath. Rest of interview went well but later felt embarressed that I am the one who can’t even speak to people with out gulping air (exaggereted opinion which I know none of those thought).

Great people, very professional with steering the conversation and most of all great learning opportunity - one need to be mentally prepared for these kind of situations. Need to go back on training how to control mind and body with breathing on stressfull situations and from now on I stand on important meetings if possible so maybe I remember breath.

Thanks

Hi everyone, I graduated with a B.S. chemistry degree recently, and after a well deserved respite, I am ready and prepared to enter into the work force. However, with some preliminary research, it appears that the demand for chemistry graduates(at least undergrads) has been stagnant. I am feeling a bit worried and doubtful of my decision to pursue a career in chemistry, which is why I’m here, asking for some advice from those who are further down their career path than I am and gaining some insight on things I should do and watch out for in the near future.

A little bit about myself first, so you can (vaguely) understand my situation better. I am Canadian, and I enrolled in a university in the US and started studying in September 2021. I believe I am a very good student; I graduated cum laude and a year early by August 2024. I gained some independant research experience as an undergraduate in an organic polymer lab, and then shifted to a biochemisty lab, where I assisted a graduate student with a project. After graduating, I spent a few months in my home country to spend time with family, and now I am well rested.

The main problem/concern I have with respect to my career is that I am hesitant to choose a career path out of the hundreds of options availiable for me; I am afraid I’ll be stuck to a low salary dead end job with no opportunities in my 30s. For example, my research tells me that any of these sectors are valid options for a B.S. Chemistry graduate: material science, patent law, food sciences, cosmetics, environmental science, instrumentation sales, forensics, toxicology, etc. Some people tell me to choose the one I like the most, or most “passionate” about, but I think that is BS because…how am I supposed to know which one I like without a complete understanding/experience of what a job in any of those fields entail? Personally, I want to choose a path that strikes a balance between good compensation, future career prospects, and difficulty/safety. I don’t really mind if I dislike the job, just as long as I don’t loathe waking up every morning. How should I navigate this problem and ensure I make the right choice in this pivotal moment of my life?

A secondary problem/concern is the location of the jobs; although I am Canadian, I intend to work in the US via the [TN visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals) and eventually get a green card, and choosing a location with the best employment opportunities, cost of living, safety, and many other factors out of the myriad of cities is daunting. Given the current state of the US, I realize that certain cities are so disparate to others, moving from a US city to another could take more adjustment than moving to a different country. That is scary, and I do not want to make such a costly mistake and end up discontent with my enviroment. With that being said, which factors should I take into consideration when picking a city to move to? Is there any discrimination against non-US job applicants? Which cities should I absolutely avoid? Any comments or suggestions will help, as I am pretty clueless when it comes to US cities.

If you have advice for me, or want me to clarify anything, please let me know. DMs are welcome!

They advertised the role as remote, but over time insisted on relocation. I really didn't like the concept of relocating to such a remote and cold part of the US (and didn't like their evolving expectations), so I sat on the offer while I was interviewing for other opportunities, mainly in data engineering. They eventually rescinded their offer.

Many people advised me that I shouldn't take the offer, and I myself thought I had a real chance of finding something much better and in my locale by October, so I didn't see the loss of the offer as a big deal.

Suffice it to say that it's now November, and I have yet to get another offer since that one. I'm now thinking that I made a big mistake and should have just taken it and relocated. I tried reaching out the company earlier this month, to no response. I just now schedule sent another email to a different contact I have at the company, hoping they'll accept my apology for insisting on remote work and extend the offer once again. Though, frankly, they advertised the role as remote, so I'm not sure what I'm really apologizing for. But I also just need employment, I don't care about who's in the right and who's in the wrong right now.

I'm having serious doubts that I'll be able to secure employment before the New Year. It's incredibly despiriting, especially seeing all my old coworkers secure new roles. I'm coming up on 8 months unemployed... I just feel like I blew what may have been my only lifeline.

I don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying all the standard advice for job searching, and it was successful once. So I know my methods aren't completely terrible, but it's been 2 months since my last offer.

People I've shown my resume to say it's just fine. I'm networking and reaching out to people I know whose companies are hiring.

I've fumbled technical interviews that just reinforce my previous doubts in myself as to whether I'm really capable as an engineer. I'm second guessing myself hard right now. I feel foolish for believing that I could do better than what I was offered.",2024-11-12 01:20:54

In total from the first of February to now I've put nearly 50,000 miles on my personal truck (my payment due to a trade in that I was upside down on before is now almost $1,000 even.) I was given a company gas card, and nothing else. I'm in charge of paying for oil changes and tires and any other upkeep. My base salary before any sales was about $350 a week. I had pretty much all the free time in the world, but I suck with people most of the time and according to other salesman that have been selling for 30+ years this is the worst year they've ever seen. Benefits are pretty interchangeable through both jobs. They offered to try and work with me and maybe get a stipend or something worked out with the truck payment or something to keep me with them. 

The new job (I actually went to orientation today and passed all the tests for the final onboarding process and received my PPE and workboots) would pay $18.28 an hour, minimum 40 hour work weeks, would save a ton of miles on my truck but take away all my free time.

The pay would be consistent though, and every 6 months after the 90 day probation period they test your welding skills and you have the opportunity to gain another $1.00/he until you pass 3 tests, then the 4th is worth $1.50/hr. After that you are eligible to begin learning a leadership role or move positions to earn more.

It's hard to feel good about something like that, even if it was the reason she got the job in the first place.

Then there's the whole dynamic with other women—some want to be her friend, but others hate on her and make her life difficult. It’s a weird mix of privilege, but also a constant source of stress and discomfort.

Has anyone else had similar experiences—either benefiting from “pretty privilege” or dealing with the fallout of it? I’m curious to hear about both the positive and negative sides of this dynamic in the workplace.

**TL;DR:** My friend got a job because she's attractive, but it comes with harassment and workplace drama. Have any of you experienced ""pretty privilege""—good or bad—in your career? Curious to hear your stories.",2024-11-11 18:02:56
jobs,1gp0hmv,Rollercoaster of emotions during the interview process. ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gp0hmv/rollercoaster_of_emotions_during_the_interview/,2,"Just need to vent a little...

I'm currently interviewing with 3 different companies. One I've had 4 interviews, one I've had 3 interviews, and the other only one interview but I'm supposed to be hearing from them this week about setting up a second interview.  

The one that I've had 4 interviews with is the company I would like to work for the most. So I get a phone call from the HR at my #1 choice today (which I'm really excited about because the CEO said ahe would be making her decision early this week and I figured they wouldn't call if it wasn't good news). HR tells me the CEO I interviewed with thinks I would be better suited for a different position. They want me to look over the job description and then get back to them. 

I wait for the email, I go over the job description and it's right up my alley. Very similar to what I'm doing in my current position. Pay scale is also the same as the original position I interviewed for. So I'm super excited at this point thinking like ok this is pretty much almost a done deal. I email HR back and tell her yes I'm interested in this position as well, and then she asks me when I'm available to interview for the position this week. Like, I guess it makes sense that it's a different position so maybe I need to interview with a different department head, but at this point after 4 interviews, I would have thought they already know everything there is to know about me 😂😂

So now I'm off my high of thinking I had the job, and ready to start the interview process again. I'm a little bummed but still trying to stay hopeful. This is my first time really looking for a job like this, so I'm just not used to all of these steps 😫😫",2024-11-11 19:17:21

Depending on my main job’s schedule?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gp84d6/how_understanding_are_companies_if_i_wanted_to/,0,"Even though these “2nd jobs” would most likely be in retail and food service, I used to work once a week (at Chipotle) in between my full time job from before.

But since I was starting to lose interest in warehousing, I’ve decided to become a shift lead manager at Chipotle, which pays slightly better than the warehouse I used to work at.

However, since the store I currently work at doesn’t allow set days off, my schedule is random every week, and even though I’ve accepted it, I only average anywhere between 32-37 hours per week, since they don’t do overtime, unless if someone calls off & we need to stay a little longer or if another store needs some extra help, which is why they don’t schedule any manager 40 hours per week, unless if overtime is necessary, which may or may not be available for me every week.

This would also be temporary until I start training for an assistant manager position, which may not be until next spring or summer (depending on several factors)

Furthermore, I’m asking because I can still help out somewhere else once a week, but due to my inconsistent schedule at Chipotle, would any retail or food service job even consider me if I wanted to help them out once a week?

I could let them know a week before (in advance) what day would work best for me, since my Chipotle schedule is planned out 2 weeks in advance, even though I could survive without a 2nd job, it’s always good to make a little extra money because of inflation.

On an extra note, I’ve considered Doordash, Grubhub, & UberEats, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it, since I have an older car and live in a town with less than 20k people…",2024-11-12 00:39:03

I have had a few ""fuck around"" jobs and I'm looking for a place I can make a career at which is why I want to go for a well known company that has their shit together. I figured if you put good in, you get good out, so I decided to start applying on the company websites (I don't see a lot of large, established companies posting on Ziprecruiter/Indeed anyways) and writing a custom from-scratch cover letter for every job. 



It's been two weeks since I went through and applied to those 7 jobs, which I spent an hour each on, and they have all rejected me. By the way, it takes an hour for me to apply to those because they ask for dates worked, a description, and references for your last 5 jobs or whatever, when all of that info is easily available on my resume. Anyways I put it all in because I was trusting the process and I want a good job, but at the end of the day every single one of those jobs rejected me.

  
Compare that to going on Ziprecruiter and being able to apply to a job in under one minute. Most of them are just click boom applied, some will ask your gender/ethnicity/disability status as well which adds another minute. So that's 1-2 minutes per job instead of an hour, and like I said I applied to a bunch and now I have two interviews.

  
Why would I ever take the time to go to the company websites and apply for the jobs at the big established companies? Am I just sure to get rejected from those until I have more experience?

I started as assistant manager, got promoted to manager, then we opened a second location, and I've been managing that one. 

Just saw a statistic that the one I've been managing longer has had the largest growth in the brand in the past year, and it was already a top performer. The other has had the 3rd greatest growth in the brand, but still has a TON of room for growth.

The owners are very involved, and we work really well together, so I can't take all the credit as I couldn't do it all on my own, but still.

Anyway, I'm fine doing this for a little longer to try and see the potential of that second location, and maybe even seeing another location opening up, but I don't see myself being a manager forever. It's a lot of hours/days In a row, and even when you aren't working, you're working, and at a moment's notice, if something goes wrong, I have to drop what I'm doing to resolve the issue, whether that's being on the phone with someone troubleshooting, or going there myself to fix it. Having to resolve customer disputes, marketing and tracking ROIs, hiring and firing (the hardest part by far), training new staff, leading team meetings, performing employee evaluations, keeping inventory, tons of cleaning (it's a spa, the standard has to be high), scheduling, managing memberships, selling, running commission reports... I think, once I have a family, I won't want to be in a position where I have to sacrifice so much time from my family to make sure the place performs.

Not to mention, I'm not making enough to live overly comfortably. I'm surviving, but I'm getting married next year, and I'm having trouble paying for things, and I want to buy a house before we have kids in the next 2-3 years. That and put something away for my kids and for retirement. I also do not receive any benefits aside from 10 days PTO a year.

I'm absolutely open to learning new skills and changing industries. I actually got offered a job in my brother's construction company, but my fiancee didn't want to make to that area, so I don't think I'll ever be able to take it.

TL;DR: I've been a manager for almost 5 years, but I want something a little more consistent with better perks/benefits but I'm not sure what jobs I could apply for, or if I'm qualified for anything else. What should I look to do?

My main interest is infectious disease. My dream project would be to determine how infectious diseases play a role in the development of chronic diseases (specifically, autoimmune disorders). I have a background in genetics, molecular biology, research, toxicology, in vitro and in vivo systems, a little bit of epidemiology, and microbiology. I have work experience in academic research and a few years in industry. I would love a job that combines bench science, epidemiology, and science communication. I also have extensive experience in leadership through my extracurriculars. 

I am planning to apply to at least one fellowship through the CDC. But I am at a loss about what other careers I should consider. When I look through LinkedIn, I haven’t found many jobs that call out to me. 

Additionally, I would prefer to work in the Midwest/Colorado, but I would consider other areas (except for Florida and California at the moment).

Hi everyone. Just to get through this quickly I’m 26 and have a first class honours in business management with finance. 

Since i was 16 I’ve been working in the family business (Afro Caribbean hair and beauty store) which is in the retail sector. Over the last 10 years I’ve done every role in that business to practically running the store. I’m at a point where I have realised I don’t want to do this anymore. The pay is terrible. The timings are not fit for a long term future and I don’t enjoy it anymore. 

I just don’t know what career to go into. I’ve never had another job before. Although I want to be in a job that I like, pay is also a big thing for me. I want to earn much more than I am right now. 

If I was to list my skills I would say I’m very organised, driven, good communication skills, good customer service skills, really good when it comes to logistics.

So far I had loved the system.. Anytime there’s a holiday and our department is closing, the manager just sends an email to us to request time off and we pull time from that bank. 

Otherwise, the time just sits and accumulates. 

I have like 68 hours sitting in mine. 

I requested to leave at 2 PM, to go work on a hobby project of mine. My manager just let my request sit there until it timed out and obviously, I didn’t leave. 

I know some will say that she probably didn’t see it, etc, but she watches this like a hawk, so I doubt her not seeing it. I have always understood the rule is, if you have time in your PTO bank, they aren’t supposed to deny you.. Unless I guess you’ve been a real trouble maker. But the only denials I’ve ever witnessed before are people who drain it to 0 hours and then still want time off. 

It just felt petty. 

FWIW, this is the same boss who made a HUGE show because the girl at the front desk didn’t want a lamp on her desk.

I’m going to be 24 in a few months and I feel like I’m falling behind all my peers. They’re all in decent jobs, going to grad school or doing whatever else.

I live alone and am spending so much money on a month-to-month lease, but I don’t have another option. I’ve been looking for a job since April, and nothing. I got offered a job, but turned it down because it would have required me to move 5+ hours in two weeks to a very HCOL area with not that great of pay for the location. If it was my dream job, then yeah okay done deal. But I couldn’t justify the move if I wasn’t even excited for the job.

I’m in a group chat with girls I was friends with in college and I’m the only one who isn’t married. One other girl in there isn’t married, but she does live in a new state with her longterm partner and she’s attending grad school. I just feel so alone and like we don’t have much in common anymore. I feel like I’m being left behind because I’m still stuck in this college town working a job that looks decent on a resume, but pays horribly (journalism). I’ve working there for going on two years and the plan was to only work for one year because I knew the money wasn’t sustainable. What I DIDNT know is how hard it would be to find a new job. 

I’ve been ghosted, led on, and all sorts. I’ve gone to hiring events, attended lunch interviews and had numerous team calls with nothing to show for it. 

I obviously don’t want to stay in journalism because the pay is atrocious. I’m embarrassed of my job. I can’t move back home because my family lives six hours away. The only thing I enjoy about my life is my boyfriend, and he lives an hour and thirty from me. I feel like if I don’t find a new job soon and move to where he is, he’s going to end it.

I just feel like I’m falling behind. I was looking at maybe becoming a teacher just for the job security, but I don’t know. This whole process makes me feel worthless and if I think too long about my finances,  I have panic attacks. All my peers make way more money than me. I’m nervous for Christmas because I don’t have enough money to buy people presents. 

Also as background, I double majored in college and completed three internships so it’s not like I didn’t try. That’s what gets me. Not to sound Gen Z entitled, but I feel like we’re told as long as you go to college you’ll find a job and that is not the case AT ALL.

I also don’t necessarily know what I want to do longterm. It’s hard when you’re not on a track like lawyer or doctor. I really just want to devote my life to writing, but I know I need to pay the bills. ",2024-11-11 12:19:36

I went through a very lengthy, time consuming interview process for what felt like my dream job. It went well until I talked to an executive in the very last step after 25 hours invested in preparing for a grueling process, the written project, and numerous interviews. 

To be clear I usually interview extremely well but I know when I’ve messed up. I know I’m not perfect. I’m getting feedback soon (which is great) but I know I was thrown for a loop talking to this exec because he was pretty rude from the beginning and it was clear he wasn’t listening to what I said.  It feels like it was mostly incompatibility at the last stage since things were going quite well until I talked to this last guy, which is fine. I don’t want to be somewhere that’s a bad fit. 

What really baffles me is how much this turn of events is affecting me. I don’t understand it - usually I bounce back, and while I know a lot of time was spent on this I do feel it was a valuable learning opportunity. 


Existing depression is markedly worse, and I’m feeling utterly unmotivated to keep applying. I’m still doing so, but I’m getting a ton of rejection emails and those are affecting me worse than usual too.

I’m looking for suggestions for a second job that can offer flexible hours.

Right now, I work as a retail manager in California, where my hours vary a lot—days off, shift times, and availability are all dependent on business demands, especially around the holidays. Because of this, I need a second job that’s as flexible as possible. Leaving the retail role isn’t an option right now.

I’ve tried gig work like DoorDash, but with California’s high gas prices and the wear on my car, it hasn’t been worth it. Any suggestions for flexible, low-commitment work that could fit alongside my retail schedule?

Thanks in advance for any tips!

jobs,1goub0s, Seeking Advice on Deferring Start Date,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1goub0s/seeking_advice_on_deferring_start_date/,0,"Hi everyone,

I recently accepted a Senior Analyst role with BCG. I began interviewing in late August and accepted on October 24. The recruiter offered me two possible start dates—November 18 or December 18. After some consideration, I chose November 18.

However, I’m starting to feel that the December start might have been the better choice, as I’ll only have a few days off between my current job and my new role at BCG. I believe that a longer break would help me transition more smoothly and avoid potential burnout.

Would it be appropriate to reach out to my recruiter to discuss deferring my start date to December 18, especially given that the initial two months appear to be primarily orientation and onboarding? I want to ensure this wouldn’t disrupt the team’s plans and anything that is already scheduled, but if it’s feasible, I think it would benefit both myself and the firm. 

I think I have built a really good rapport with the recruiter and team and don't want to appear flakey or disinterested with this being one week out. I very much love the lateral career move for me.

Thanks in advance for any advice! I appreciate your insights.

**TL;DR:** I recently accepted a Senior Analyst role at BCG, with a start date of November 18 (though I was also offered December 18). I'm now considering asking to defer to December for a smoother transition and to avoid burnout.

Hi guys, I am currently interning at a company and recently had an acquaintance reach out to me asking for any open positions in a certain team here. Since I have only been working here for a few months, I did not want to breach any boundaries and make a referral. Additionally, I thought that referring someone whose work ethic/skills/qualifications that I was not aware of could backfire on me if they were to get the job and underperform.

 
Nevertheless, instead of making a referral I gave them HR's contact and told them to reach out there. In their email to HR, they used my name and mentioned things about the company that I told them. I had told them that the team that he was interested in joining is looking for new workers (which I believe due to sentiment around the company but I did not confirm this with that particular team).

 
He contacted me today saying that he got an interview and would like me to ask that particular team some things that could help him do well in the interview. The thing he asked me to ask is not unreasonable at all but I don't want him to bring up the fact that I told him certain specifics about that team.

Is what I did ok? Should I ask the team he wants to join the questions he has?

I have a job offer at a more reputable employer, for $70k/year. Here I would not have the same benefits, and would have to show up on time and work hard. But, it is a huge firm and there would be great room for growth. 

Yes I will be negotiating with the job offer for more compensation; and sending that to my current employer to see if they would be interested in matching/bumping my salary.

Since then there have been two co-workers/colleagues that are of a lower position than me that have truly gone out of their way to help me learn and teach me how our corp's ""industry"" functions and operates. They've been patient with me taking a lot more time to do things that normally could be done 2-3x faster, even on days when our workload is way higher than normal. 

  
I am aware of how much they make in terms of a range because it's public information or you can just look it up on any job posting website. And compared to my compensation it is significantly higher.  So as a way to say thank you for their help, teaching, patience, and all that I want to give them a bonus from me personally (whether it be considered a Christmas gift or they would consider it a work bonus I guess because we're co-workers or something). 

  
Can anyone give me any answers as to if this would be illegal, unethical, or frowned upon and what not? There is no policy in our corp's HR and terms or whatever saying anything about not being able to give any money or something to a co-worker. But I just wanted to make sure it would be okay and anyone else's thoughts on this idea. TIA!",2024-11-11 08:44:10

I currently make between $80,000-$90,000 based on my commission and the lowest I could go while still living a lucrative life is $70,000 (my wife makes $60,000 so together we make a fairly decent living in cheap old Ohio). What are some options I have for a new career that pays decently and keeps me M-F 9-5? I’d like to stay in an office setting but all indeed shows me is sales jobs and I just don’t know if I have sales in me for much longer. Is $70,000 with no degree in an office realistic, or am I lucky to be bringing in what I do now?",2024-11-11 15:57:43

\- constantly says ""where i worked before......""

\- legit thinks hes gods gift to the industry

\- have seen this guy talk AT someone for anywhere from 15 to 120 minutes straight with basically no input from them

\- he has no idea when to shut up or when someones attention span is gone - he just talks and talks and talks

\- the guy really cannot hold a conversation, just talks AT you not WITH you (IE, he talks at you from the perspective of he already has all the answers and very very, very little of what he says is inquisitive)

\- most annoying of all, he randomly tells me ""HEY OP, COME HERE COME HERE"" & when i get to his workstation, its a fucking youtube video hes got pulled up to show me - nothing job related at all, so it's low-key disrespectful in that he thinks its OK to make me hop up, basically jog over to him, and it doesnt have shit to do w/the job and he KNOWS i will likely go over when he says ""HEY OP COME HERE LOOK AT THIS"" b/c i think its job-related.

\- worst of all, he is my trainer who im stuck with and the bosses have said they will not change my schedule to train with someone else, so the only way of escaping it is to quit. 

\- i asked for a meeting and the big boss said to him straight up ""you sound like a blow-hard sometimes"" and it helped for maybe a week, and now hes back to being a know-it-all who wont shut the fuck up.

ive never in my life met someone more unaware than this guy and hes actually said he knows how to ""read the room well."" what? no you dont. not a little bit, not at ALL.

afraid im going to have to quit this job. not sure if its even worth telling this guy straight up. if my bosses boss telling him wont change anything, how could i. 

im also thinking about quitting this job anyways because i moved back to the midwest for it, and my quality of life has turned to absolute dog shit. im not bragging but i had way more friends, way more things to do back when i lived in colorado. ",2024-11-11 00:34:27

-talks shit on me to clients while i’m literally right behind her 

-gives me a task but won’t tell me how to do it or where the materials are that are needed to complete it, then gets angry with me if i do it wrong

-yelled at me for using the wrong pens. apparently the grey pens are for customers only and employees are to only use the blue pens due to germs

-makes fun of customers after they leave the store. she literally mocked a woman’s voice 

-told me her previous assistant broke down in tears because she entered inventory wrong in the computer and then mocked her old assistants crying noises while laughing at her

-tries to get me to not take a lunch even though i’m there for eight and a half hours at a time

But here’s the issue: my only coworker is my boss, who has two kids (and you know how kids are with germs). In the past four months, she’s been out sick three separate times. Each time she returns to work, she’s still coughing everywhere, and she gets me sick every single time. I know it’s her getting me sick, because of course it’s too coincidental to not be her, and I barely interact with anyone else outside of work. Most recently, she got me sick again, so I brought up a conversation about basic office health precautions, like wearing a mask when coughing. Her response was that she checked with our RVP, and since it’s not company policy, she doesn’t have to, adding that “germs are everywhere.”


Slightly off-topic, but I don’t think the RVP has the best impression of me. My boss frequently reports minor disagreements to him, like me taking a nap in the break room during my lunch break or closing the office when she’s not there and i need to use the bathroom/ take a break. Meanwhile, I’m always covering for her, handling her tasks, and picking up the slack when she’s out, but she rarely acknowledges that part. It feels unfair that she’s quick to escalate the smallest mistakes on my end while I’m constantly stepping up to keep the office running smoothly.

My doctor cleared me to return on Wednesday, but when I informed her, she said she’d still check with the RVP even after I provided a doctor’s note. I even offered to handle some tasks remotely if needed, but now I’m feeling scared to take sick days in the future. i know for a fact she tracks the days i call off on her calendar but i haven’t been out of office since september (when she gave me a bacteria that made me get tonsillitis)

Is there anything that could actually happen here, or am I overthinking it? I know from now on, I’ll can just wear a mask if either of us is coughing, but I have a fear of repercussions especially cause i’m hourly and at-will, and it’s making me anxious about taking sick leave.

I get calls from someone with a hard to understand accent, yes I know what country they're likely from...however trying not to be too obvious, that works for say ABC Tech Services, they reach out after some back and forth trying to tractor beam out of them what they're calling me about and a clearer job description.

1. these callers want me to commit to an hourly rate/salary BEFORE having a chance to read up more on the position/contract work...often I find on my own that the jobs pays MORE than what these guys want me to commit to NOW, like RightF--kingNow...at first I'm like, derp, okay...then when nothing happens, I start digging and find the job REALLY pays 2-3x more than what they pushed and pushed for me to accept RFN.
2. another caller insists I accept a low paying salary in a HIGH cost city for a vaguely worded description of the job, then go crazy with ""send me the text code RFN"", then start calling me every other minute to get this code...there I learned XYZ Tech Services was creating a job profile ON.MY.BEHALF to someone like Tata Consulting and again, the job listed there pays way higher than what XYZ says it pays...like W-T-actual-F?

Once they get what information they want from me, usually name, email, salary/hour rate, resume and maybe home address/phone, it goes DARK!?

WTF is this crap?

How can I fix this?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1goqwv3/im_terrible_at_being_detail_oriented_my_boss_has/,1,"Hello! hopefully I can find some external insights and advice on how I can navigate this. I will give some background on my career first.

I (30F) used to work in IT in client based roles for about five years when I decided on a career change, as I wasn't enjoying it at all even though the pay was decent. This led to me finding digital marketing, and I've now been in the field for almost 2 years.

I enjoy the work, much more than I used to, however I'm still technically a junior (even though I was mid-senior in IT), so I need to accumulate more experience to go client based again. Right now, I'm working my ass off in consultancy / agency life until I can gather enough experience to find a company with a less stressful environment. Probably 1-2 more years until that's possible for me, since the competition for those roles is high.

What I've found is that the pace in these types of companies is not for me (I was very fortunate in IT and the pace was perfect for me), and unfortunately that's something I have to bear for now. I can be fast when completing tasks, but if I don't double check, it's very likely a mistake has been made.

My organization skills are also mediocre, and when I have to deal with multiple projects at the same time, I get overwhelmed and miss details, or forget to note something down that is important in the longterm.

For example, last thursday I had 3 meetings with 3 different clients, one after another, and for one of them I forgot to note down that I needed to stop a campaign that was consuming budget. Out of probably 30 pending tasks in total that I had to note down that day, I only noted 29 and missed that one. During the same week, I also made a mistake in the text of another campaign, which came from rushing as 3 campaigns had to go live at the same time and I was just pumping them out between meetings.

This caused my boss to freak out on me today (understandably so) and we have a 1:1 tmorrow. I already apologized but I want to be proactive and assertive and find ways I can fix this. But honestly, I don't know how. All I know is that when I have too many things going on, I get overwhelmed, and forget to note things down, or sometimes I note them down but then I don't remember / don't have time to look into those notes.

I've only been at this company for 2 months and I truly want to get better, but I don't know if there's something wrong with me. I'm already juggling 3 projects, still learning the ins and outs, and helping in 3 others. This is the normal pace for every employee because that's how consultancy / agency life is here. I don't want to go down a self punishing road again because I am too hard on myself with these things. Any advice or tips are appreciated, thanks.",2024-11-11 12:20:52

My brother has graduated college but seems to have no intention to find a job. What he does all day are sleeping, playing video games and watching random internet stuffs. Even when I find some good job listings and send to him, he doesn’t care to apply at all. Everytime I mention the job finding topic, he ignores me. He still lives in my parents’s house (but not with my parents) and he seems to enjoy his life right now too much, or just too lazy to join labour force.
A bit back story, he has Business Administration Bachelor degree from a quite reputational university in my country - but only with Average degree. During his student life, he had no part-time job, no internship and as far as I know he didn’t care about studying at all. I hooked him up with an internship position in my friend’s company but then I got too many complaints because of his attitude and laziness.
Now I dont know how to make him stand up and find a job. Even a low paid or internship, as long as he gets up and go out for a while for his life. Thank you for any advice.",2024-11-11 10:37:01

I created a new email + account w/ the company and reapplied to a job that I meet ALL qualifications. This time, I received the assessment IMMEDIATELY after submitting the application. I also saw it was from the recruiter that interviewed me for the previous position in October.

I’m in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some advice or recommendations on part-time jobs or side gigs. I currently work under an agency, earning minimum wage, but the job comes with a pretty challenging policy: ""no work, no pay."" This means that if there’s a suspension due to typhoons or school closures, I don't get paid for those days, which has been happening more frequently than I expected.

On average, my monthly income is around 10k pesos, but after mandatory deductions for government benefits and the agency’s fee, I’m left with much less. The problem is, this income barely covers my transportation, and sometimes I struggle to even buy food or essentials. It’s been really hard, and I’m starting to feel the pressure.

I don’t want to keep depending on my parents, especially since their income is also limited. So, I’m reaching out here to see if anyone knows of any part-time jobs, online gigs, or flexible work that could fit around my current schedule. I’m open to anything—whether it’s remote work, freelance gigs, or something flexible enough that I can manage alongside my full-time job.

If you’ve been in a similar situation or know of anything that could help, I’d really appreciate it. Any suggestions, tips, or leads would mean a lot right now. Thanks so much in advance!

I don’t regret going to art school as it’s my main passion and skill. I’ve trained myself since early teens in classical methods and my tutor says with my skills at my age I could be very successful and am far ahead of my class. Despite this, I think I have to be realistic and pick something else. I was going to attempt illustration or maybe work in the entertainment industry as some sort of designer but these jobs are hard to come by and I’d need to be very lucky. Art will always be with me and I’ll always be making it, but I want a career. I don’t want to be working minimum wage jobs in 15 years whilst still trying to support a small art career. 



I have other skills but they aren’t much better in terms of career (photography, guitar but I’m not good enough to perform or write the kind of music I’m in to, amateur video editing) If I have to do another job to support myself, I’d rather spend the time and possibly money (uni courses are cheap here) training in something I can at least tolerate if not enjoy that hopefully pays decently and has a better career path. I did really well in school but I only took literacy and creative subjects. I remember really liking and excelling at Graphic Communication, using Inventor to make 3D models but not enough people chose it and the class was stopped. For that reason it’s probably too late to get into any science or tech based courses since I don’t have the qualifications. My best plan right now is to volunteer at my dad’s work, which is sort of Law adjacent and if I like it do research and possibly study Law. This is my best plan so far.

There were barely any patients there since it just opened and I was the first full time worker there. The manager and building owner often put their pain out on only me. And the nurses begged me not to quit because of this. 

My manager told me she’s gonna start leaving the clinic open until evening hours. She said she has another receptionist for the morning and wants me to start working the evening shifts. I already know how everything in the building operates and the passwords to things, so that’s why she wants to leave everything to me during the evening.

I was searching for jobs in the meantime. Luckily this company reached out to me after an interview and wanted to offer me a position as an administrative assistant. Here’s what I decided to send to my old manager, it’s pretty self explanatory what she did that made me very upset.


Good morning. I really appreciate the opportunity, but you have not answered messages or phone calls in the past few weeks. I understand that you’re a busy person, however that is not okay for you to dehumanize me the entire time I’ve worked with you. I apologized to you several times for small mistakes that every other worker was doing. When I asked for constructive criticism to do a better job, what you said forever scarred me. You insulted my facial features, as if I could change how I look. You were very insensitive when I told you about my car accident and you said to “start taking an Uber” then. Uber is very expensive, and you took money out of my paychecks so I’m not sure why you think I’d listen to you. You have never defended me or said anything nice about me to the coworkers, it was the coworkers actually defending me from you. You constantly lied about me and talked badly, even made fun of me for crying because you shouted at me. I only knew you for three months, I don’t know you from anywhere, so I’m not sure why you said, “I look at you like a little sister”. You are not my sibling, you are definitely not my relative, let alone friend. I really wanted to bond with you and befriend you, but that is very difficult when you constantly bicker me and don’t even respond when I happily say “good morning” everyday. I have always been very kind to you, I always say good morning and hello, so please don’t gaslight me into thinking I was a “mean person”. You are only my boss and I have to listen to what you tell me. It’s very difficult to do so if you never trained me to do anything. Also, you told me that you “don’t owe me a reply”. Which is ironic because you’re the manager. You’re my boss. How will I do my job if your excuse is that you don’t owe me a reply? Speaking of which, telling me 2 weeks into working that my “first three days are training and not paid” is pretty funny to me since you never gave me training at all. For anything.

You are an awful manager and an awful person. I hope you heal.”

Edit: for anyone saying “what’s the point of complaining/she won’t care/etc..” I’m already reporting her to the department of labor for taking money out my paychecks and discrimination from all the mental abuse.

They started by demanding me to start at 7:30 am every day even though I signed for an 8 am start (still get paid for those 30 min) on my second day.

I got verbally reprimanded for going overtime on my second route where I was stuck in traffic and affected by a lockdown. 

Although this added stress it wasn’t too bad. But bc of this pressure I went a week and a half without even taking a bathroom break. 

Then a week ago I got into a workplace accident (not at fault) and I feel like things have been worse.

The day of my accident they asked when I can come back. The day I got back they demanded I start at 7:30 even though I wasn’t 
driving. And they have been constantly pressuring me to start doing my routes again this past week. 

This accident has me dealing with three different types of insurance and when I brought up the fact that the workplace accident, injuries and their pressure is making me overwhelmed the manager blank faced full on said “why?” As if it were a walk in the park.

I have worked through an assortment of jobs; my first job was at McDonald’s in high school, then as a customer service agent for a weird (maybe shady) vacation club, then as a supermarket cashier, then as a clerk for an accounting firm, THEN as a clerk for a law firm, then as a manager for a trading card store, then as an RBT for 2 months and am now…a teacher. My degree is in Political Science, I wanted to become a lawyer but after working for them and seeing what the lawyer-life was like I backed away from the idea (my at-the-time boss aka head partner at the firm supported this.) I have been a teacher for 2 years, I am 25 years old and am tired of it. I work at a Title I school and things are rough; rougher beyond belief, and I don’t want to do this anymore. 

I don’t want a new job, I want a career! I don’t know where to begin. I’d like to say I have a diversified skillset, but I don’t know how to even approach starting myself on a career path without going back to school. I’m in Miami, which is already hell on Earth when it comes to finding good paying work, let alone decent rent prices, so I’m lost. Any advice for a schmuck like me? Thanks :)",2024-11-11 00:34:29

I want to clarify that my lay offs were not performance related, and I consistently got positive feedback across the board, as well as bonuses above my allocated percentage. I have been a top performer in all of my roles. My experience lies in strategy and operations, and I feel like I’m in a rut and wondering if I should get an MBA to enable myself to move into more revenue generating roles in order to potentially be able to stay a company long term. I’m very torn on whether or not to invest in an MBA program. I have a BA, but in an unrelated field to what I have built my career on, so all of my experience was learned on the job and self taught. I am trying to decide if I should make the investment to increase my knowledge and skill set by doing an MBA or continue on the path I’ve been on. I have held senior leadership positions for the last 7-8 years and I’ve been in the workforce for about 12 years. I am really struggling and I’m feeling very overwhelmed and lost.

jobs,1godchd,My CV sucks Help!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1godchd/my_cv_sucks_help/,1,"Help! I'm having a hard time explaining my CV and my life. 

I'm(f) in my mid thirties and my twenties got ruined by bad advice, bad anxiety, a bad relationship that was also religious/cult-ish, and just general bad luck. In my early twenties I moved to a small city where jobs are sparse and was so nervous in job interviews that my face was twitching, so it rarely was a good interview. My cv is riddled with temp jobs and  short hires from those years.

I moved again in my mid twenties to study and have gotten a business degree now but it took longer than anticipated and because of a controlling relationship I wasn't ""allowed"" to work during my studies. Tried applying for jobs in this new town after finishing my degree.Because of my job history I was called a ""weak candidate"" in the interviews I did get, and the rest of the interviews got cancelled when covid hit. 

After more than a year with job hunting I broke off the relationship, left the religion, and moved back to my hometown. Here I did get a couple of odd jobs, but then a year was ruined by a toxic job that ended up firing me. Mny others were quitting because of the horrible culture, one middle manager even ghostet the boss and everyone else after an argument, just quit showing up or answering. It's a long story. I removed it from my CV and have a gap there instead. Then I broke my leg and one year was ruined by that. Funnily enough I had just printed a copy of my CV when it broke. Job hunting has been hard the past year after my leg got better and I think it's because of the CV. I'm better at job interviews now but only get to be second choice when it goes well. 

Now I'm trying to study something business related and a part of this course is internship. But in internship interviews I notice that they are highly suspicious of me and my character based on my CV. I feel like I am being accused and on trial. I don't know how to navigate these conversations.

Do I tell them the truth during the interview ? I'll leave out the bad job unless they specifically ask if I've ever gotten fired(I actually got that question once). If there's no hope of getting an internship, then should I drop the study? What do I do? Do I need to be upfront about my bad CV in my application letter? 

TLDR: my CV got bad from bad luck and it's turning off those hiring.  How handle interviews and how do I turn my life around? ",2024-11-10 22:52:12

I’m a dispatcher at a paratransit business. Upon starting here I enjoyed it, and for the first 6-7 months I still enjoyed it for the most part. But the place I work for has been steadily declining. When I say that I mean the quality of employees is getting worse, the management pays little to now attention to large issues within the company, and the few employees like me who care about the job and know what we’re doing are expected to pick up all of the slack and produce the same (if not better) results that we normally would.

It can get extremely stressful since as a dispatcher I’m almost entirely responsible for the 100s of trips we have in a day, and majority of the time, I am the only dispatcher on duty. This means that if we are short drivers, have a vehicle break down, or if we are running late, I have to handle it, it addition to making sure clients are picked up on time, helping drivers find locations, taking complaints, and god forbid something such as an accident happens in the midst of all that because I’m expected to handle that as well, and move all trips from that route.

It’s gotten to a point where when I get home from work no matter what I had planned on doing, I can’t help but to go to sleep from how mentally drained I am. At first I was able to have the mentality of “whatever happens at work stays at work” but in recent months I can’t help but to bring my stress home with me. I find myself dredding having to go to work every morning, mentally preparing myself for the worst. I skip out on social gatherings and going out because I just want to sit at home and enjoy my quiet time away from work.

I’ve been applying to dozens of jobs for the past month or so and have heard back from little to none. Granted I’m 21 but I have a lot of good experience on my resume. Management, Forklift certified, driving a commercial bus, manufacturing, and tons of other stuff. 

I’m at a point where I’m considering quitting without having a job lined up because the stress of being unemployed and searching for a job may be less stress than the bs they put me thru now.

And yes I’ve brought many of these grievances to my bosses and even corporate people but they brush it off as if it’s nothing.

I've only ever worked physical construction jobs in high school and during college, however I just got my first ""entry career"" job as a bank teller. I'll have full benefits with PTO and a set Monday thru Friday 9-5 schedule. They'll also be paying $5000 a year towards my tuition for me and since I'm a finance major after 6 months of working as a teller I'll be eligible to apply to other roles internally. I'll get to shadow any departments at the bank I'd like and once I get my degree I'll likely be able to be promoted assuming I'm not already promoted before I graduate. The only caveat is starting out my pay is $17.50/ hour.

I've been comparing myself to my buddies who went the trade route and I'm feeling super behind. My buddies who are all the same age as me are making much more than me doing construction. For example one friend is in the elevator union and he's making over $50/hour as an apprentice. Another buddy started at an HVAC company 2 years ago and his starting wage as an apprentice with no experience was $24/hr. Fast forward to today he's making $44/hr.

Like I said I've only ever worked physical jobs in construction and landscaping my whole life and I like being physically active however I know deep down I'm doing the right thing for my future and how my body will thank me. I enjoy finance and find it interesting and this job is an incredible opportunity that will almost guarantee me a career once I graduate.

I’m gonna keep it vague but for context: I work for a publishing company based in London & it’s very male heavy, I was normally the only woman in the office. There was a massive ‘boys locker room’ vibe going on. 

Sometimes I would be sat chatting with my coworkers around someone’s desk and suddenly the conversation would switch to their favourite types of porn. 

I’m not a sensitive person at all but they would make really misogynistic or sexual comments about me or just other women, in general, which I found horrible. 

For example, ‘how often do you have sex with your boyfriend?’ ‘Does your boyfriend beat you up? I would.’ ‘You should be in the kitchen.’ ‘You’re looking thicker lately.’ 

I also generally didn’t have very good working or personal relationships with the men making these comments so it wasn’t like friendly jabs it was like ‘wow, I hate this woman.’ 

I do want to bring this up because although I’m leaving I won’t be the last woman they talk like this to/about. But I don’t want to come across as whiny or that sort of thing.

So I am someone who loves to work. I hate not being able to work. But ten years ago my cousins were in foster care for over a year and no one in my family was even remotely interested in helping them.

That's where I come in. Now both kids are special needs in their own way. One of which is VERY autistic (I'm talking about the no talking, needs help bathing kind of thing)

So even though I went through a lot of stuff to help them blah blah blah (they are older now) I don't know how to explain such a HUGE gap. and I don't want to put ""stay at home mom"" because we all know what that looks like and isn't taken seriously.

I don't know how to put that I'm a ""caretaker"" or wtfe without it seeming... well people see ""stay at home mom"" as not having job skills or losing them or something?

I don't think I'm explaining myself well but I just don't think ""stay at home mom"" or ""foster parent"" (we did adopt them btw) or anything alluding to care taking or mothering or staying home will get me anywhere on my resume (I'm applying for clerical work as I have a lot of experience in it)

Can anyone give me some real advice? I'd greatly appreciate it



Edit: I'm getting a lot of suggestions thank you so much! There are a lot of questions surrounding what I have put and how, so here is the resume I have currently. Critique away! I don't mind constructive criticism!

For context,  I have a BS in Economics and Business. Worked both student odd jobs and proper jobs like in a negotiations firm, a business consultancy and a CEO for a tech startup where I managed to grow revenue quite wel and optimised the whole company. I speak five languages fluently. I have been absent from work for a while due to my family member's health situation and now as the situation got better I am ready to get back to business.   
  
My question is what are the chances I can land a simple project/product manager position? I have tech skills to work as junior DS or work in data analytics and management as well or a simple thing as market research and yet - zero. EU market is dead I guess. I was thinking remote US but I doubt US is hiring anything european unless it is a referral. I even appllied to entry level jobs, I don't mind but even there I was rejected. I could manage some of these businesses... People in my network tell me it is pretty dead. Does anybody get hired in Europe at all? What am I looking at? I get it that the job market is oversaturated because of all the boomers holding the positions and overegulation to protect the established power poltiics and business connections inside EU protected.

On one end it heavily impacts sense of self-worth and I am close to organising pan-European rebellion aka Bolshevik revolution. Starting with Brussels... On the other hand I'm between not applying for jobs anymore and just getting my shit and go by foot all the way from Cape Town to Shanghai. No food no water no shame.",2024-11-10 13:39:21

I live with my girlfriend and she can support us both financially independently, but I can afford to help out with 1k a month. 

I have three years of experience in a director of athletic communication role, but let that job to move in with my girlfriend. 

Right now, I have a part-time job in public relations with a professional sports team that pays $18 an hour for every home game. There’s approx. 40 games from now until April. I also am working with local colleges statting their basketball games for $80 a game. There’s about two games per week. Finally, to make these two occasional yet awesome sports experiences work, I work part-time a grocery store for about 25 hours a week. 

This is all amazing and I’m so excited to have experience with a professional sports team. I believe it will really help me get a full-time job somewhere in professional sports soon. However, I am interviewing for a full-time athletic communications job right now as well. It pays 50k a year and is stable, and safe. It’s what I used to do before I moved in with my girlfriend. 

I’m worried that if I pass up the full-time opportunity, I may regret it down the line if I struggle to find work. However, if I take the full-time job, I’lll have to stop working with the professional sports team which will make me sad, and will hurt my chances of working on professional sports down the line. 

Any tips on making my decision between a stable, full-time job and working the part-time jobs temporarily until after the professional sports season is over? Thank you! ",2024-11-10 15:58:08

I work at an amusement park, its pretty good pay for what I do, and I can make enough to live comfortably if I can get my hands on a management position. I've already gotten 2 pay raises since I started. The ""hierarchy"" in my department goes servers < cooks < captains < coordinators < head coordinator < HR. I enjoy having a lot to do while I'm working, and I haven't been getting that. I consider myself to be pretty good at my job, and my coworkers often come to me for assistance before our store's captain. I mentioned to my boss that I'd like to have more to do a couple weeks ago.

The park has been closed for renovations for the last 2 weeks, and my first shift since then was yesterday. One of the new additions was a new kitchen, and I was put in charge of running it and training four of my coworkers in there. Three were captains and one was a coordinator. My head coordinator kept popping in as well to praise my work, and two of the HR ladies kept swinging by as well. The CEO of my company also came by while I was by myself near the end of the day, and it felt like SHE was looking for MY approval with the new kitchen and machines, which was a little scary. 

I can't tell if I'm supposed to looking forward to a promotion or not. This is the first time anything like that has happened to me at work. I mentioned it to my boyfriend, who's worked there for a few years, and he said that it sounded like they were preparing me to be a coordinator.

The day of it all this BS happens. I think its because my boss basically said ""I am crap at what I do and can't handle the move"" so VP guy who got me in to energy interview in the first place hears my boss say this and then freaks out, somehow gets the interview cancled, and then pulls me into a ""coaching meeting"" where he COMPLETELY takes the side of ONLY MY BOSS and completly ignores any of my side of the story and my logic. Then says ""you need to do xyz or get fired"". Great coaching. Seems very very very \*not professional at all\* and I can't help but think my name got slandered to the point that the guys in Energy cancled their interview all based off of what a guy told a guy that told a guy... Fooginell man

**NON TLDR (enjoy the drama):**

Hello, I am an Electrical / Computer Engineer from the best electrical engineerig program / university in a 500 miles radius (Mid-Midwest). I work in a small team doing low voltage design. I am about a year out of school. I have worked here at the consulting firm for 6 going on 7 months now. My team consist of ""boss"", ""J"" and ""D"". J and D are the same role as I am except I dont have years of experience like they do.

At my 30, 90, and 180 day stays, I expressed that I am not too sure low voltage (LV) is for me. These XYZ day stays are conducted by the ""VP electrical"" that is above ""boss"". Lets call him ""VP"" or ""VP electrical"" from now on. OK, so at the last 180 day stay thing, I spoke that I am interested in changing sections after giving LV a real shot. LV work is brain-dead and out of my small team of boss, J, and D, I am the only electrical engineer for real. Boss was electrician, J was a camera man, and D was an architectural engineer recently turned LV engineer.

So, after I mention this, VP is happy and is like ""lets get you into section X!"" Why didn't you just say so?! Lets make it happen!"" He says... Cool, I get turned to the VP of Energy (I want to do controls, SCADA, process piping (aka actually complex engineering, not building buildings). If I made this move, I would no longer be under either boss and or VP electrical. I have been having real problems with the team as they are all remote so I never see them. They are also perpetually unavailable on teams. I mean if you look at their schedules, they are in meetings 80% of the day, no exaggerations. So after I have a video-call with VP Energy, I thank him for showing me what they do, tell him that I am excited for this, and am ready to make the move. Therefore, we setup an interview.

At this point or before, I believe I should have let my boss know, but I was not planning on letting him know anything until I am sure that I would like to make the move and is also offered a spot! Seems logical. So suddenly, the day of the interview with Energy, one guy declines it after we have been communicating and had this scheduled. Very strange, OK, the other team lead that I was mainly talking to will still be there.... DECLINED. OK, now this is super strange. I ask these guys ""hey, why did you decline the interview?"". You know what I get hit with? I get hit with this: ""I was told to stop the process"". I am confused but think its just nothing and things are going swimmingly. Oh NO...

This is when it gets juicy: later that day, out of absolutely no where with zero communication for this meeting occurring, with only 30 mins of heads-up, I see a ""coaching meeting"" has been set. It gave me a strange / bad vibe. I check to see who this is with and I see: Boss, VP electrical, and an HR lady. Oh SHIT, here we go. WTF happened?! So I mentally prepare myself for what I feel is about to be carnage. I get on an I see both my boss, AND VP electrical are supremely mad. Uncontained anger, just barely keeping it under wraps. What the heck is going on? I ask ""hello, I see I was put in this meeting, what is going on?"". Well VP elec chimes in and says ""well OP (me)... we have a problem (basically, I don't remember what was said at first). Then they open a document called ""coaching memo"". This is where the shit hits the fan.

This ""coaching memo"" thing is just a letter of PURE ANGER. As they read it, they bring up the most petty things, little issues that have been plaguing me the entire time at this job. I can tell who wrote this, it's obviously my boss, not VP elec. I do not EVER work with VP on ANYTHING. After this seriously hurtful, non-positive, angry, finger pointing, terrribly written, ""coaching memo"" was read to me as I sat silently just taking the full weight of the bullshit, I first ask who wrote this while knowing full well who wrote this. Then it dawns on me, the reason my interview got canceled is because VP-elec must have mentioned it to Boss. I had not told Boss about this yet as I was not ready and also this was a thing that VP-elec setup for me in the first place. What gives?

Well, after asking who wrote this, Boss instantly steps in and said ""Well me and VP wrote this >:( "". Ummm, sure. HR lady says ""you have any questions?"". Oh HELL YES I HAVE QUESTIONS?! Do you think I am just going to take this sitting down? Just let you bully and falsely accuse me. The thing that made me the most angry was that not only did boss hold this in when I had asked SEVERAL TIMES about my performance only to be told that I am doing ""VERY WELL"" but that I am ahead of the game and it will still take me a year to get fully up to speed. Then, this same guy has all this crap to say to me and the VP is also on my ass? What gives? What exactly happened this morning I think to myself.

Well, I was basically told that ""you cant go to energy because you are not focused on your current role. You say that you don't like LV and that you want to move to Energy. Therefore, you can not go to Energy because you are unfocused. Also, you turn things in unfinished, ask too many questions, and are not a good learner""

This just made me so angry. The first statement about ""bc I am not loving LV, I cant go to energy"" is a logical flop. I clearly ask them this ""so are you saying this?: If there is a guitar player who expresses interest in playing drums, does this make him any lesser of a drummer?"". Their answer, YES. OMG NO IT DOES NOT make you less of a guitar player? Who *are* these people? I regret saying anything to VP electrical. He is a jerk. Dude talks all the time about being christian but when it comes to it, this is how you act? Not only this but both of them did not listen to a THING I said in reply. Every word went in one of VP's ears and out the other

But the biggest thing that annoys me? THAT MY INTERVIEW WAS CANCELED! Dude completely overstepped his boundaries. If I was not already within the company, I would have interviewed earlier this day. IDK what you said to those guys but if it was ANYTHING along the lines of ""OP sucks at his job"" then we have a HUGE problem now and I am about to pull up some serious evidence of the massive blunder that these guys just pulled on me. I think what happened was Boss caught wind of me trying to move to energy, somehow talked to VP elec and essentially talked seriously poorly about me to the point that VP-Elec decided that not only does he need to cancel my move to energy but to also make this BS ""coaching session"". LORD I AM... IDK what I am rn.... :""( So many things wrong with this.

I ask them to elaborate about the ""Issues"". they say I ""keep making mistakes"", so give me an example instead of making this seem like its the end of the world. What are the mistakes? You know what it was? I forgot 1 out of 50 card readers on the redlines. You know *why* I made this mistake? Because D (co worker) gave me edits (redlines) to make, you look at it and do whats marked. Again, zero brain cells required. There were a few card readers that said ""coordinate with Kate"". Who is kate? So I ask D ""hey, idk who kate is"" Can you please coordinate with her. No reply. BTW, I get ALL MY WORK THROUGH either D, Boss, or the 3rd guy, J. Therefore, D is the one that does the communication. Dude just ignores my calls and chats (says is ""too busy""). Then, once he (prob) got flamed for forgetting a card reader, he bitches to me about ""how you need to be more diligent and double check things and blaw blaw blaw"". I tell him that this is all on you man. I can pull up chats were I told you I need help and you don't reply. Where I call you and you don't answer, or how even if you read it, you dont respond. IDK why you don't like me, but we need to work on this. So don't come to me, mad, when there is a mistake like this. Also, you are a suck a$$ teacher. Also, I heard the story of why this guy always has a terrible gotee and it goes like this: My girlfriend in HS liked me clean shaven so when we broke up I swore I would always have a gotee... Brother is now married with kids in his 30s and still does this. Stop it.

This is the same guy who CONSTANTLY Socratically questions me. They are the ones who sit in the meetings with the owners and have been working on the projects mostly. So when I ask ""hey, is this a type 1, 2, or 3, firealarm (just an example)"" I want an answer, not to be told to look at this and that code book. I get socratically questioned, so I look in the book (even tho on the other hand they say don't look in the books at codes, it burns up fee and you should be drafting). I find my answer, but ask *again*, is this right before I waste days working on it only to find that it was wrong and I need to redo everything because I didn't ask questions! They are so completely angry at this point that ""I got it wrong again"" they say that they know the answer and the answer I got is wrong (both D and Boss at this point). Well, these JERKS are actually wrong. I just opened a go-by project for the building as we are just building the LV devices on: the camera, data, and fire alarm for 1 floor out of 12 on a building, and LO AND BEHOLD, THEY ARE WRONG! I WAS RIGHT! The other floors were build exactly like I said. No credit given to me. Again, IDK if they even read what I sent them. I would just call but dude is just a jerk.

Dude (D) even started a thing where the joke is, if something goes wrong, we need to ""Slap OP"". Brother, I get it, I guess you don't like me. It was funny ONE time, not the 12th time. Later dude tried it in a BIG meeting and I, for the first time, confront him about his antics asking ""why he likes this joke so much as its long past being funny"". Everyone is just dead silent as I don't think they expected me to respond. I think dude took it as another blow to his ego or something when I am just chillin man. What IS IT WITH THESE GUYS?! Maybe, this stuff makes them feel powerful or something? I think several things about me challenge him, from my young age to being the only electrical engineer in the group, *and* I am a pepper in a sea of salt? I'm sorry I somehow challenge you, but IDC man"". Stop it. I am always respectful. Old school: yessir, no sir. Always have been.

Yea, so the meeting with the coaching, I apporach every single point they make and time after time, my logic is completely disregarded. This battle is lost, but afterwards, I talk to the friends of my father that got me in here in the first place and they are even higher up than these jerks and hes like this is NOT how this is going to go. We are going to fight this as the little blocking of my interview might even be illegal. Wow, so yea, we are going to war. Also, I have several jobs lined up in the controls world, but thought I'd try my hand here within the company before leaving. Guys wanted me to just quit on the spot *SO BADLY,* I could just tell. I took my sweet time getting to work the next day only to find my computer blown up with missed calls at 8:03. I call Boss later that day and he appoligizes and I accept his appoligies and also tell him that I understand where his anger is coming from and also tell him that I know I could have told him about my move to energy, but thought it best to wait until the position actually is offered before talking to you. I made peace with him and never got mad at him. Like in Game of Thrones, ""You make peace with your enemies, not your friends. Thats why they call it *making peace*"". God I love that quote.

Now, the lingering issue is with VP-elec's attitude and how he singlely sidded with Boss and heard NOTHING of what I said. He also is the one who got my interview with Energy cancled and made this ""coaching"" meeting in the first place. Also, I was basically told ""you will be a better learner, stop asking remedial questions, never leave early (that was another point, I CONSTANTLY catch shit for leaving at 4 even though in my offer-letter, and my one stipulation for workign there was that I need to leave at 4. I have an entire second professional studio musican thing going on and am making money doing that. I have student debts to pay and 40 hours is NOT going to cut it. I am young and have energy so I am going to BURN it!

Not to mention that Boss took a critique of me from J (the only guy on my team thats not a jerk and is actually nice to be around) that I put some speakers at a 15\* angle as the floor plans in that area were at a 15\* angle. I DIDNT EVEN DO THAT! The intern did! I thought it was fine as the symbol was a circle so no matter how roated it is, it does not matter. None of what we do is actually 1:1 design and its just ""put the speaker in the damn ceiling tile"". We dont even show the wiring. The most intense calucation I have seen anyone on my plans or on my team do is for wattage... 10 speakers tapped at 3 watts each? 3x10 = 30. Therefore we need a 30 watt amp. Then, J and Boss have the AUDACITY to act like not only is it difficult but ""are you sure you understand""?! YES I UNDERSTAND! Gosh. Have yall ever even done REAL curcit analysis? Try a 7th degree polynomical transfer function and come back to me and ask ""do I understand again. I dare ya"".

Lord that was a lot to write. Sorry. I might just make this a PG version and use it as documentation for my deformation of character single-handedly by my boss playing the telephone game with an asshole named D. J is chill. If I can get into energy, I will. That is the only section where the people don't look like their souls have been sucked thanks to this company. Oh, and I was told ""I don't fit the comany's standard"". Again, sorry I am no slave but a thinker, a question asker instead of a nodder, one who has a uniqe style and is a non-conformist. Even if I tried to conform, the skin I am in will never allow me to. Therefore, I am unabashidly myself! :D

If anyone read this far, what would you do? What do you think of this. This was a terrible experience and getting gate-kept from an interview seems very very very not professional and I can't help but think my name got slandered to the point that the guys in Energy cancled their interview all based off of what a guy told a guy that told a guy...

I also tried applying to AI training jobs, but it seems extremely soul crushing.  
I obviously also tried going for Translator/Localizer kind of jobs, but nada, nothing, no response most of the time.
Most of the time I think I'm either overqualified or severely under qualified for the positions I apply to. I am, at the moment, in a metaphorical ditch, because I really don't know what to do now. Do I keep on sending CV's whenever I find something I'm interested in? Do I try my best all the time even if I know they'll reject me? 
Please, I need some ideas, and thank you for your time.",2024-11-10 12:08:48
jobs,1gnz6rv,Financial advisor looking for salaried role — in any field—DESPERATE ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gnz6rv/financial_advisor_looking_for_salaried_role_in/,0,"I (49M) need a new job asap.  Background:  Bachelor’s in Finance from a Big 10 university.  Worked as a municipal bond broker on Wall Street straight out of college for 20 years.  Was downsized out of my job when my firm was bought up 10 years ago.  Since then I seem to only be able to get 100% commission jobs, selling insurance and annuities.  I have not done well doing this.  Several reasons: I have a family and need to put food on the table, so I don’t have time to “build up” a client base through social interactions, hosting webinars, etc. I also don’t have money to buy leads or to spend on marketing myself.  You really cannot succeed in sales without a way to get clients.  It is too “iffy” and not really in my comfort zone.  

I also have a mental illness that is now under control but there were periods during the last ten years that it got the best of me, which made doing a commission-only job even more difficult.  I am doing very well now and if I had a steady paycheck it would go a long way towards not only helping my family, but keeping me in a good, positive place.  The uncertainty of commission only added a great deal of stress.  

My wife works and my parents have helped cover a lot of our bills over the last ten years.  They wanted to help because of my mental illness so i let them because my kids needed to eat and if I couldn’t do that i was grateful that someone could.  But it also allowed me to loll longer in a job that wasn’t cutting it (or that i wasn’t cutting it at the job) but they are not flush with cash and can’t do it much longer.  I am grateful for their generosity but I am a grown man and this is not how it should be.  I need to earn money but would prefer something with a steady salary vs commission only.  

I am open to anything.   It does not have to be finance related.  I would be happy right now with $65k/year (or more) steady job.  Any realistic ideas?

pocket. in hindsight, i can go home and technically the servers and manager’s could seat the customers using the same chart i’m using. again i don’t mean to be ungrateful because it’s still a job and i’ve had jobs where the work has been unrealistic for one person. some times i get on my phone because they’re allowed but even then i can only consume so much brain rot before im bored. but geez.. sometimes i just want to pull my
hair out over how unbelievably unimportant my position feels at work.

I work a regular, not really a qualified 9-5 job, which however brings me more than enough money to live on a relatively high standard, with a good management and it feels pretty stable. 

Recently, my friend has reached out to me and gave me an offer to participate in one of his projects. It would require me to learn additional skills and study quite a bit of learning material, as well as getting into an area I don't really have much experience in, although my friend is sure my ""intelligence and ambitions"" will make me successful at it (I think it could very well be the case). 

The catch, however, is that his requirement for that is that I quit my job. He said he would reimburse me with my pay in full, and I am sure his financial situation will allow him. He said that when I will have finished the studiyng for it, I will have enough experience to work on my own and earn big money, in multiples of what I am earning now. 

There is still a lot of uncertainty on my side though, because there's still the option I will not be good at the job and will be a failure without any money to live off of.

Especially when I’m preparing a résumé and cover letter that is tailored to that job that I’m looking for. Like yes, they require too much out of us, I may not have all the experience they’re looking for, and I will face risk of being rejected automatically. But at the end of the day, if I were to show them, how honest I am and why I should still be considered for that job despite not having all that they’re looking for, I just might stand a chance getting that job.

I always believed that any information you give your potential employer, like your work experience and education should be true. Why is that? Well worst case scenario is they decide to look up the company you claim to have worked for and possibly give them a phone call. That phone call will definitely be the maker or breaker of whether or not you’re telling the truth. And if they say something different from what you just said, it’s gonna come to the part where they realize you lied about your experience on your résumé just to get that job when there is tons of people who always tend to be honest and true about their experience and would not take a chance hiring you let alone inviting you for an interview.

Now someone clean that stretch the truth isn’t always bad or isn’t bad at all. Reason being is due to companies using a system that tries to match a résumé with the keywords that were placed on the job description to see if that candidate will be a great match for this position or not, and if your résumé does fit the bill, good but when you have to meet them face-to-face, and back up what you say on your résumé, all I can say is good luck. But maybe I’m wrong, or maybe some of you may have a different opinion on the subject. But for me, I will stick with being truthful and honest.

* Go to company websites to apply directly and DO NOT USE the easy apply on LinkedIn, unless you enjoy not hearing back. 

* Made new connections and used existing ones via LinkedIn. 

* Research the company, the hiring teams and always be prepared. 

* Send thank you emails and follow ups no less than 24 hours after your meeting. 

* Keep the mindset of “It’s a conversation and not an interrogation.” Remember that Culture and values mean more than salary. (It’s hard but you’re interviewing the company just as much as they are interviewing you.) 

* Kept my morning and daily routine. Don’t forget to take care of yourself and stay in touch with your family and friends.

So I recently applied for an HR position within a company I have been on the retail side of for years. I got an interview (yay!) and have been emailing with recruiting about scheduling it and after having set up a time for early next week I received this email. 

I’m definitely overthinking and a little anxious because of how badly I want this job so I’m posting here to see what y’all think this could mean?

It would be my first HR position but I’ve done every retail role available in the company from entry level to store manager and am currently getting my MBA with a concentration in HR management so I feel somewhat qualified. Would just love to hear if y’all think this means they’re nervous about me or if this could be a good sign?

I had hoped this past year that my employer would see my experience/ knowledge and amazing work ethic. I have been a mentor to the other techs, implementing new protocols etc. Attendance near perfect. 
 At my review at my corporate job I was told I earned a 2% raise. I have never recieved 2%, always 4 to 5%.  Other technicians recieved 2% too allegedly. These are techs that are on their phones,  call off routinely etc. I spoke openly about my disappointment.  I stated that my experience should count for something, I was told experience doesn't count, they rate on performance. I believe the payscale isn't right, fellow techs making 50 cents less an hour then me, who have been working for 5 ish years.  I  stated that not only did I take a paycut,  im paying more for health insurance , and a few other things. I was told that my employer only has a set budget every year for raises. The head dvm said she would email her boss to ask for more of a raise for me. I believe nothing will come of it. 
Another hospital thru the same corporation just posted an open position that I could apply for. Advertising they value experience techs.

It's been three months of looking at very little success - hundreds of applications and resumes sent. This is only my fourth interview. I worked in office and made $52,000 annually.

---

I now have two job offers. 

1.)  Marketing and Website company. Basically calling 125 businesses a day that have requested info some time in the past 5 years but never got signed up. Cold calling basically.  Trying to get them interested again and transferred to the sales team. Very large successful company with really cool company culture. In office role. 

$54,000 per year salary
+ 15% commissions on successful sales they end up closing
(they said average rep makes $60-65k)

-------

2.).  This second company is in the same industry I've been in for past 23 years - apparel decoration. I know their company, product, website, etc very well because they were my garment providers.   Largest blank garment wholesale company in the country. This is an account manager role. 150 max accounts you manage in your territory. Staying in touch via phone and email. Answering questions, helping solve issues, sending info on new products, giving them a white glove vip experience.  This is closest to my last role and the one I want the most and would be best at.
There is some sales but it's not be sales - just based on what your customer base already orders.  This job is REMOTE (new for me). 

$50,000 per year salary.
+ Estimated $5000 to $10000 commissions a year. 
(so around $55k to $60k a year maybe) 

Benefits are the same for both. 

So what do I do? 

Do I try to negotiate with the one I want for higher base pay - $52k or maybe $54k. 
I can't risk losing the job over it. 

Never done this before - are you expected to negotiate?  Could they take back the offer or will they just say no?",2024-11-10 01:54:53

mine has us working 2080 hours/yr with 60 night shifts

for context, we work 12hr shifts. mine has the same exact coverage just NOT rotating on night shift as often as his does, which is objectively unnecessary.

no, there's ""nothing i dont know about night shift"" that he knows that's the cause for us work nights more often. we would still work nights with my schedule just NOT as often.

earlier this year, our schedule was 2 weeks of days, 2 weeks of nights then repeat (awful if you ask me)

we then went to 4 weeks of days then 2 weeks of night (a lot better imo)

so because we have 6 teams, but one person cant be left alone now, we have to go to 5 teams and the manager is under the impression we *have* to go to a 5-week rotation with 3 weeks of days, 2 weeks of nights, however this is not true.

while i sort of get what he's saying, his stance has been ""we have to go to 5 week rotations""

so what that ends up doing is having us working more night shifts per year. we already have problems retaining people so i dont think this will be best for our department long-term.

all that to say, i have figured out a way to ensure 100% coverage with all of our requirements on a 6 week rotation, 4 weeks of days & 2 weeks of nights *with only 5 teams &* working an average of 40 hours a week over 6 weeks, whereas the manager thinks we have to go on a 5 week rotation, 3 weeks of days 2 weeks of nights to accomplish it.

yea im sure someone will go ""you think youre a know-it-all????"" and that is not what i am saying nor implying.

They seemed to like the example assignment I did for them, and everything was smiles and positivity. This company is also aggressively seeking multiple people to fill multiple roles. I've actually had 3 separate recruiters reach out to me about this job, which means that in theory, my resume is exactly what they're looking for...At least on paper.

At the end of the interview, the Creative Director said, **""I'm going to email HR so we can move you on to the next steps.""**  To me, that sounded like I maybe got the job, because this was the final interview in the process. So what other ""next steps"" could she mean?

But that was two weeks ago, and I haven't heard anything. I tried emailing a follow-up to the recruiter who used to facilitate communication between me and the interviewers, but he never responded to me, either.

This company is in India, (I'm in the US) and they just celebrated Diwali, so they probably had time off of work for that. And my one friend just got hired to a company in India, and she said it took them 4 weeks to get back to her with a job offer. So maybe, just maybe there is hope that I just need to wait a little bit longer?

Since moving to the US, I also worked as a foreman mover for 1.5 years (because I was waiting to get my work permit). Just like relationship banking being a foreman is all about sales but I'm not sure if including it will hurt or improve my chances of getting hired. And if I don't include it I feel like a blank 1.5 years don't look great on a resume.

I’ve also read that a business degree might be required for this role here in the US. Does anyone know if prior banking experience (specifically as a relationship banker) is enough, or would a degree be absolutely necessary?

Additionally, I’m wondering what skills or accomplishments I should highlight on my resume to make myself stand out. Do they place a lot of emphasis on sales numbers or other metrics? If so, what’s the best way to present this kind of information to give them what they’re looking for?

I'd like to point out that I do understand the pretty much all of the words when someone talks, even if they are technical, but when I'm speaking they don't come naturally to me (for example, a lot of people would use ""purchasing"" instead of ""procurement"" in the title of my question).

How can I brush up on my English skills in a couple of days? 

Also, if anyone has any specific experience in this or similar position, please share your advice on what to focus on in the interview and what kind of person are they most likely looking for.

Thank you.

jobs,1gng3wy,Worth it to keep interviewing with this company?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gng3wy/worth_it_to_keep_interviewing_with_this_company/,4,"Hi Reddit,

I’m in the process of interviewing for a marketing assistant position that I really want. The first interview with the recruiter went well and the second interview with the hiring manager went well.

Crickets for two weeks, so I emailed the recruiter to ask what the next steps were and that I was still interested. The recruiter replied and asked if we could meet over Zoom yesterday for 15 min to discuss the position.

Turns out the company restructured during this two weeks and an internal person took the job I was applying for and they promoted 3 people, so now 3 new marketing assistant positions opened up. Essentially she said applications would open up for those next Friday and she would push my resume through so I wouldn’t have to fill out the application again and that she would email me Friday to keep me in the loop. She also said the hiring manager liked my problem solving skills and communication skills and had no negative feedback about me, so she said the hiring manager would act as an internal reference for me.

Anyway, I’m wondering if this is a good sign and I should keep going through the process and hopefully land one of these open positions or does it sound like they’re just dragging me all over the place?

Thanks in advance!",2024-11-09 18:10:31

jobs,1gnj1vc,Holiday Party Attendance 3+ Hours Away,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gnj1vc/holiday_party_attendance_3_hours_away/,2,"I recently saw my one of my cousins at a family get-together and she was very unsure of how to handle her employer's Holiday Party.

As most of her cousins and family in general are or were Physicians none of us knew how to advise her and she is one of the few in the family who didn't go into Medicine and Medicine doesn't work the same in general as the Corporate world does.

She recently joined the company ( roughly 5 months ago) and works remotely from her home. 

Her employer does have some offices, but they are nowhere near where the Holiday Party is being held, in fact she is actually one of the closest to the location and she is 3+ hours away by car.

As she explained to us, her employer rents out a resort for the party and gives everyone a hotel room for the night which is fine, but they don't cover travel expenses to get to the resort.

She was not planning on going because she doesn't want to make the drive didn't want to put the wear and tear on her car, didn't want to spend the money for the gas and didn't see the benefit, she doesn't even know many of her colleagues as they are based all over the place.

In fact, her boss checks in with her once a week and that is the most that she hears from anyone at the company, otherwise she does her work and  nobody really bothers her.

So, she was surprised when her boss asked if she was going to Holiday Party because it is always a boat load of fun and it is one of the few times he gets to meet face to face with his subordinates, she didn't know what to say because if he had not called, she was going to RSVP no.

Now she is concerned that there is an expectation that she has to go and she has zero interest in going.

The medical practice that I work for has not done a Holiday Party in maybe 20 years because as the head of the practice says all the time, he has heard loud and clear nobody likes forced office fun, so he gives $250 gift cards instead and says take your significant other out for dinner on the practice.

Her Father, my Uncle said, he didn't know how to advise her because he never had to deal with that being a Neurosurgeon and his practice never had a Holiday Party over the 40 years he was in practice.

What do folks in the Corporate World things, does she have to go or is it acceptable to say no?",2024-11-09 20:23:50

Today at the exit interview, I was described being overly calculative, rigid, inflexible for constantly exercising my right. Her justification? I received bonuses twice in a year and it should be more than sufficient to cover additional petrol costs. 

Her words were ""You could've been more flexible and have more empathy towards me. There's no need to be calculative. It frustrates me everytime when a receipt under your name arrives on my desk requesting for a petrol cost reimbursement. Should I be reducing your bonuses in order to fulfill those claims?""

I am currently working fully remote and it's decent pay. Nothing amazing, but nothing bad either.

* I work in the film/game industry. What I want to do is mostly work on the creative side. I do small gigs, indie films, and games. I want that to be my main career at some point. Still young(ish) and getting more and more bigger projects, but this is not enough to pay bills for now.
* I've been working at this current job since 2020. This job is fully remote and the same industry, just more business and copyright side of things. I was actually let go this May 2024 due to ""Work force reduction"" They called me back a month ago. I had a rough time during unemployment.  This job is perfect because it's simple, but I have meet quotas. However it allows me to do freelance work and work more towards my main career goal. No room for growth or pay raise anytime soon.
* One of the jobs I applied for back in August when I was unemployed called me back. Went through 3 rounds of interviews and said I am fit and got it. They gave me about a week from yesterday to sit on it. It pays about 8$ more than what I currently make. Still in the entertainment industry. More of the business side again. The company is much higher status in this industry and is very well known. I am going to be working with high profile people making it greet to further my career, sort of. I can't really stick my head out saying that tho.
* Here are my thoughts and concerns. I want other peoples opinions and see what you guys would do in my shoes.
* New job CONS: Hybrid 3 times a week in office. I am in Los Angeles. If you do not know LA traffic on freeways is god awful. The drive is 30 mins, but with traffic this turns a 30 min drive into 1hr and half or 2 hrs. I know this already. I am afraid I won't have enough time to work on projects and work towards my actual career I want to do. Time is honestly so valuable to me.
* New job PROS: More money, more connections, more opportunities to meet high profile people.
* Stay at old job CONS: No pay increase for a while. Quotas to meet. They fired me once and I am afraid they would do it again.
* Stay at old job PROS: Work at home. More time for to work on other projects. More time for me in general.

I know it's weird for me to think of staying at my current job, but the traffic time and money all play in factor. Keep in mind these jobs are not my passion or my career. They simple are jobs for me to pay bills and to help me grow. Lucky enough for me both are in the entertainment industry.

Just seeking some advice on facing certain unfair contractual issues before signing an offer. I realised after you do get an offer, there is the problem of looking through every clause in the contract and making sure it's reasonable and fair to you. And more often than not, it is not. So there were times where I brought up the issues I had within the contract and told the HR to correct it. Sometimes they will obliged and resend me the contract.

However, other times they would just take very long to correct it and end up sending me an email (after a long while which I followed up on) stating other reasons that they would retract the offer. I'm seriously offended when this happens because let's say you can't agree to the corrections I propose, then why not just upright say you can't do it? Instead of giving me some lame ass reason for retracting the offer. Can't even be truthful and take accountability for it. And I wouldn't give them the benefit of doubt here because hey, you have already sent me the contract to sign, so by right you are already fine with whatever is stated in the contract, but I'm not fine with it. And by sending the offer, aren't you already at least 99% sure you are satisfied with the new candidate? So what other kind of valid reason can you give for withdrawing an offer? It's not even unforeseen circumstances. But thankfully I dodged a bullet so I guess it's a blessing in disguise.

Anyone else also faced similar issue where your offer got retracted because you proposed some changes to the contract which they may or may not be able to correct? Do share in this thread if you relate.

All I can find online is phone sales jobs from home and that won’t work for me. Other ones are out of state and won’t hire remotely even if it’s a remote position.

I hear people find work from jobs all the time, why am I struggling?

Any advice on key word searches, job search ideas, etc would be helpful.

jobs,1gn82wu,Should a job be causing me this much stress?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gn82wu/should_a_job_be_causing_me_this_much_stress/,1,"I started at my first job about two months ago (early September) and it is causing me an extreme amount of stress. I'm only fifteen, so I know that anything I do in relation to work now is really just for experience, and to be able to save up some money. This also means there aren't any major repercussions if I leave, as I'm not relying on the income to live off. I'm currently working at my local McDonalds, and I can't seem to figure out what about it is causing me so much stress. I've gone through all the training, I'm relatively confident with everything there, everyone, including the managers, is very nice and helpful when I'm unsure of something. I have a couple of friends there, and I'm getting rostered on vaguely regular shifts. It's been like this since I started, where I get this overwhelming sense of worry and inability to focus on anything for the days leading up to my shift. I'm fine once I get there and clock on, but the lead up is horrible, and it's seriously interfering with other aspects of my life, which is the main issue. 

I'll definitely wait it out a bit longer until I make any decisions as to whether I stay or not. It's almost the end of the school year (Australia), which means I can pick up quite a few shifts over the summer holidays, and the stress of it wouldn't be impacting my schoolwork. 

So my main questions are: is this normal? Should I be experiencing this much stress from a job, and is it worth my time to stay there much longer? I really would like to work, and it's good having something to do, but this stress is becoming unbearable, to the point I've nearly called in sick a few times because of how much I thought I was going to be sick.

It really sucks to get ghosted by HR after submitting one. I have been asked to take one for a current job prospect. Here's how that has gone so far.

She finally replied with ""Apologies for the delayed response"" and i had an interview with her that went well. Now I'm being asked to take a 2-hour (unpaid of course) edit test. I simply don't trust her to not ghost after I submit it.

I'm brainstorming strategies that could work. Ask before I take the test how long it will take them to give feedback on it?

jobs,1gn91w2,More pay or better benefits? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gn91w2/more_pay_or_better_benefits/,5,"I'm currently a department director at a regional nonprofit. I started a little over a year ago after restructuring my own business (in the same general field as the nonprofit). Our ED of 25 years moved on over the summer, and our interim leaves some things to be desired. New leadership should start in January (supposedly).


I was invited to apply to a Research Technician position at the University in our city by a colleague of my husband's. Had the position been open last year, I would have accepted it before the one I'm currently in. The position is in the same field as the rest of my career, but has a smaller focus than the umbrella of work I cover at the nonprofit.


I was offered the position surprisingly quickly. The pay is slightly higher  than my current role, and has much better benefits—including the opportunity to attend school again at no cost, something I otherwise would not be able to consider. 

I think the university position would provide a greater sense of security (my predecessor didn't apply to a single grant the year before I began, so we're really doing heavy lifting trying to rebalance), and I think the leadership would be a lot more stable.  

I love the work of my current job, and I truly believe in the mission of the org. I’m building a few really awesome programs, but they will take years to flourish. The issues there stem from staff management and leadership insecurity. Basically—as a director responsible for staff management, I haven’t yet been able to hold under-delivering (we’re talking calling out 20%, misuse of funds, and not completing basic grant deliverables) team members accountable. Leadership will enter endless “mediations” that don’t result in measurable change. No PIP has been approved despite multiple requests. I cannot move forward with termination without a PIP first. Despite being in an at will state. There’s also just weird things within the finances. I’m “not allowed” to know the operational budget of the whole org, but am also responsible for managing grant budgets that help pay for some of those expenses. I don’t feel I can accurately approve line items without knowing the full picture. 


It felt like an obvious choice until my current boss basically asked my price to keep me around. I asked for a $15,000 raise. This would put me at the salary we claim my position makes in our grants. However, my position is underfunded through grants alone. 

Other factors to consider are: benefits. The university has a grant package, while the nonprofit has a very basic.  Flexibility. I have a small child. The nonprofit allows extreme flexibility in my day to day schedule, while the university would have fairly stringent start times. (Something toddlers occasionally  have trouble with, and my husband’s position starts too early for him to handle drop-off). I also can easily change a workday if my child is sick. 

Moreover, I'm curious which position has a greater career path, which is a thing I didn't consider in my youth because I immediately went into business ownership instead of career building. My nonprofit job is very dynamic. The university job is technically lower on the chain, so to speak, but it working for a well recognized professor in a growing field.
If I knew we were going to stay in our city forever I would take the university position for the sake of my blood pressure, but there’s a 50/50 we move elsewhere in the next five years.

My work announced a restructure in summer and immediately I was devastated. My team were being moved elsewhere so I had no direct reports, my job which I’ve only been in 18 months was not what it was sold to be and I really missed the creative and leadership side. I worked super hard to get myself seen infront of the director, to prove I was worth not dismissing and she started to see promise in me. 

I asked advice on going for new roles in the team and grade higher, and identified my dream job. Only problem was it was also advertised external (unlike a few ringfenced) and my experience wasn’t comparable to potential applications. 

I interviewed for another role as practice, got mentoring from the deputy director, smashed that interview and essentially turned down that job as I was promised the other, took on extra jobs from other teams and generally worked my ass off for 2 months whilst preparing. The director had multiple conversations with me where the job was mine. Told me not to worry in her head I have it, has set up these training opportunities and explicitly said on multiple occasions she’s not looking for experience and she can train any skill but the right attitude is what she needs. My hopes are risen, I was so anxious all this week because two months had built up to this and ‘it was mine to lose’. 

Anyway I did my absolute best but after a grueling 48 hours wait I was told. Told she’s really sorry but someone has come with 20 years experience, she knows this means I’ll probably leave and hopes I don’t. I’m absolutely devastated, can’t get dressed, can’t eat, can’t sleep. My trust is shattered. 

Then to top it off she asks me to step up for 3.5 months because the successful candidate has 3 months notice. 

I’m going to have to take it to get the title on my cv and leave. But it’s going to kill me doing my dream job to hand it over, especially after all of this. 

My question is: has anyone ever done interim on a role they were promised and then not given?

jobs,1gn8k1m,Job hunting is almost impossible for me now...,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gn8k1m/job_hunting_is_almost_impossible_for_me_now/,1,"I work retail and have been at the same place for almost 9 years, but it's time to move on. I recently graduated college with a bachelor's degree in something that has nothing to do with my current position at work, and there are no openings in the main office that tie in with my degree.

The only issue is, there's a policy that changed recently within the company. If an employee wishes to work elsewhere, the prospecting employer must pay a $40 fee to verify his/her employment (basically a 2-3 sentence email saying their current position is X and they started working on Y date). Not only that, but if the same new employer wants to also verify the employee's salary (or wage placement/hr), they're charged another $40 for a second 2-3 sentence email (or they pay $80 for one email that consists of their employment date, position, and wage placement. )

Before the policy change, I had a job offer rate of around 60% of those I had interviewed with and was given a first round interview around 75% of the time from all the jobs I applied for. Now, almost every job I've applied for would send me a rejection letter stating they were pursuing candidates whose ""background"" more aligns with their company. To me, it almost seems that they called my current employer to verify my employment but wouldn't pay the fees, meaning they would not continue the interview process even if my skillset at work and degree would match what they wanted in an employee.

So, I'm stumped. I don't want a 9 year gap in my resumé, but it also seems most jobs wouldn't throw almost a Benjamin Franklin to get trivial information from my workplace. Should I simply bring in a copy of my first and most recent paystub to verify my wage placements/approximate hire date as well as a work calendar to show my current job title and save the new employers money to invest in me before I'm even considered a candidate for a new job?

jobs,1gnmjzp,What Kamala’s defeat teaches us about our resumes / interviewing,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gnmjzp/what_kamalas_defeat_teaches_us_about_our_resumes/,6,"This is not a political post. But for most people here on Reddit, DJT’s overwhelming win was a shock. According to polls and credentials, it was assumed that the Dems were going to win, or at least be competitive. In my opinion, the biggest issue with her campaign was the lack of storytelling and effective messaging; and this is a mistake that most job candidates make as well. 

Especially in tech (I see tech resumes all the time), you see resumes listing out experience and technical skills - just like every other resume out there. How unique do you think your 5 years using Java really is? 

You need to tell a compelling story about the type of employee you are, what you bring to the table to help your next role, what kind of teams you work best in, the industry you focus on, the types of problems you want to solve, etc. 

Recruiters are humans. Yes, they need to quickly discern your skills and technologies. But simply listing those out does you no favors, just like how Kamala Harris talking in eloquent words didn’t help her. DJT, for all his flaws, was able to carve out a succinct message about why you should vote for him. Whether you agreed with that message or not, it was loud and clear, and he focused on the story instead of the details. That is, in my opinion, one of the big reasons he won. And that is something that job seekers can be mindful about, when interviewing themselves for their job.

They stated it was a brand new position, and it would be based on a financial grant the couple pant had received recently. They were waiting for confirmation, but were very confident that they could use the grant to create the new position. I was completely fine with that. Everything was going amazing, my manager was more like a mentor. It was the perfect job for me, I would be working and supporting youth with their parents. I even met my manager’s family during when I was shadowing for an event and her son even said he loved hanging around with me. She said “you did such a great job with him, you will make a wonderful mentor.” On Monday, she requested I send a reference sheet to an old employer, and I chose the one I had worked with for 3 years. After sending it via email, I didn’t get a response. On Tuesday, my manager asked I followed up because I wouldn’t be able to be matched to be a mentor for a child until the form was filled out. So, I followed up to my old boss with a text. On Wednesday, there was still no response, and my manager asked me to follow up again. I left a voicemail on my old bosses work phone. My manager asked if there was another reference I could use, and I suggested my most recent boss, whom I used as a reference for the initial hiring process for this job. I assumed she wouldn’t want a reference sheet from him twice, but she said it was fine. My manager had stated on Monday that they forgot to have me send the form out earlier in my hiring process, and now it was holding things up. 

On Wednesday night, I sent the link to the reference sheet to my most recent boss, and waited. Thursday morning, I get a response from my most recent manager and he says the link was stating it was already submitted. I told my current manager, questioning if it was an error or because my boss of 3 years had finally submitted. I should mention, my boss of 3 years never responded to my email or text, so I assumed she wasn’t interested filling out the reference sheet. We also parted on good terms, and she told me and my coworkers several times to “feel free to use her as a reference.” My manager said she would look into it when she got home, and I heard nothing for 6 hours. Then at about 5:30, I get a call and she says I am being terminated, and HR would connect with me. 
I was distraught and confused, as I had done nothing wrong. I asked for more information on why I was being terminated, and she told me that was a question for HR and gave me a number to call. About 40 minutes later, HR calls me to inform me about my paycheck and where to meet to drop off my work laptop. I asked about any information on my termination, and she said she wouldn’t know. She claimed it was a decision from upper management, including my manager. After that, I called my manager to inform her I had made contact with HR and scheduled a time to drop off the laptop. I was sent to voicemail, so I asked at the end of the voicemail to please elaborate on my termination. 

I have no idea why I was terminated. At first I just assumed the grant had fallen through and they were terminating the position. But now I am starting to wonder if the reference sheet was submitted by my boss of 3 years and she said something that would have caused me to be let go. I plan on emailing my manager and her manager who was a part of my hiring process for further information on my termination. I am completely blindsided, and genuinely confused and hurt. It was the perfect job for me, only to be taken from me with no warning on a 30 second phone call. If it had something to do with the grant, I feel like they would have met with me about it, or at the very least told me that was the reason why.

My roommate recommended I hire a service to see if my reference was saying something bad about me. Another one of my friends is suggesting I do not call either my ex-manager, or my boss of 3 years, as it may make me come off as being a stalker or something. I really just want a straight answer. I wonder if I should call my boss of 3 years to see if she even filled the form out. I know nothing will get me the job back, but I can still hope that this is some sort of misunderstanding and I can go back to last week when I was waking up, excited to work. 

I genuinely have 0 idea what to do next, and would appreciate any ideas, advice, input, or similar stories to maybe feel less alone in this situation. It’s not everyday you lose your dream job, but I wanna remain professional and not get myself into any trouble or come off as problematic. ",2024-11-09 08:44:26

I just want you to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

During this process, I had to look inwards a lot and find things I didn't like about myself, and they were amplified by the stress of not feeling I had a purpose in life. As a young-ish male in the U.S., I feel like I've finally returned to society and can re-obtain some normalcy.

I read several self-help books to boost my self-esteem and remain positive through it all and it helped so much, especially the past couple of weeks...

My dad's had 5 surgeries in the past week due to liver problems stemming from a pancreatic surgery to remove his cancer a year ago and all of this happened while I had 2 of my interviews, which led to an offer.

All of the emotions hit me like a train earlier today. My prior anxieties have been replaced with new ones and I'm still waiting on my background check to go through, but regardless I know I am of pushing through.

Many, many applications (hundreds, didn't count) and 16 interviews (20% 3rd stage, 40% 2nd stage, 40% first stage) later, I feel like I've gone through some sort of spiritual journey to find a job.

I've had multiple interviews re-scheduled, some cancelled, so many rollercoasters of thinking I was going to get the job only to be disappointed. This comes from someone who previously had no problem getting a job within a matter of days, so I'll admit it's been a significant change to adjust to.

I recognize a lot of you have been without a job for much longer, and have to go through a lot more challenges than I do, but I want you to know you can do it. It may take a lot of pain and tears but it's doable.

I left a toxic environment earlier this year in the middle of a terrible job market for many reasons:

1. Pay was inconsistent and constantly changing (not in a good way)
2. I felt I wasn't enjoying the work in my industry
3. My boss expected more and more, but provided less guidance and paid us less and less
4. My dog passed away and I felt a hole in my heart that affected my motivation
5. Favoritism made it impossible to thrive
6. **I hated the person I was becoming and I hated how I was acting towards others, including my loved ones.**

If you'd told me 6 months ago the hell I'd have to go through to get here, I'm not 100% certain I'd do it. I don't regret it, though, and hopefully I can keep working towards being a better person. I hope you all find the job/role/life you deserve. Here are some tips I have to do so:

* **Focus on yourself on each interview, not the interviewer.**
   * I used to focus almost entirely on researching each person I was going to speak to, look at their entire job history, and focus way too much on their feelings about me during and after the interview. This didn't help my confidence and didn't help me succeed at all, so I worked on doing the opposite and focusing on my own capabilities instead.
* **Use each bullet point on the job posting and state one part of your resume that fits each bullet.**
   * If the job posting has a bullet point that says ""looking for a go-getter"" or ""looking for someone that stays calm under pressure,"" use that to your advantage and find a STAR example that you stayed calm under pressure or were a go-getter.
* **Limit your time doing job apps to 15-20 minutes a day. Make it attainable.**
   * At first, I would spend hours a day filling out apps but soon realized it was exhausting me and not leading to results because I wasn't putting 100% of my energy into each app.
* **It's ok to hit Easy Apply on Linkedin, but make sure you're one of the first 40-50 candidates.**
   * After 40 candidates, the company either stops paying attention or removes the posting so there's no point in applying if there's 100+ candidates. Do your best to be one of the first. I know it's hard.
* **It's ok to say you don't know or remember a time when something happened.**
   * If a recruiter/hiring manager asks you ""tell me a time when..."" and you draw a blank, it's ok. Say something like ""I can't think of anything right now, but if I were in this situation I would do XYZ...""
* **AVOID DOOMSCROLLING, ESPECIALLY ON JOB SUBREDDITS!**
   * Even now that I've signed an offer letter and am going through the background check, I'm still fearful something bad's going to happen because of all the posts I've seen on another sub. Don't psych yourself out by obsessing over what could happen. It doesn't help.

Good luck to you all! :)",2024-11-08 21:54:29
jobs,1gn22of,How to detach/decompress from toxic/bullying coworkers when I come home?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gn22of/how_to_detachdecompress_from_toxicbullying/,0,"I know the most obvious answer is to leave but for many reasons that is not possible at this time. I plan to leave within the next 18 months but literally cannot at this moment so please don't suggest this. I also cannot move offices at this time either, I am purely looking for strategies for how to destress/disconnect when I am at home.

Context:  
  
I am a child protection social worker and absolutely love my physical job however the toxicness and bullying of the workplace is quite literally traumatizing me and destroying me from the inside out. My manager is a literal psychopath who has a history of substantiated workplace bullying (5 years ago and not against me) she is sneaky, manipulative and unrelenting. Past disciplinary action has just taught her how to perpetrate her abuse in a smarter way so that technicalities stop her from being able to be accused of bullying again.  
  
She became my boss earlier in the year (after she got my boss moved to another district) and my mental health has steadily deteriorated since. She makes it her mission in life to destroy anyone in the workplace who see's through her facade and as well as getting my old manager moved put so much pressure on two of my previous team members that they quit. I am the last person standing who she know's see's through her crap and she has hyperfixated on getting rid of me since. 

All year I have kept track of her bullying behaviors and misconduct and after many discussions with my office manager (her boss) I have recently moved to a new team. Whilst I am on a new team I am still in the same office as her and she has enormous sway over my new manager and the office manager. Everyday she finds new ways to exert control, micromanage and gaslight me and I feel like I am going insane. 

I now dread going to work despite loving my job and am experiencing enormous amounts of anxiety and depression at home as well as work (I am seeing a regular GP and psychologist and have amazing friends and family to help support as well). Despite the extensive support I still feel like I am drowning and wasting away in misery and stress. 

I would love a way to figure out a way to separate myself from her influence over me while I am at home and isolate this to just being at work. Any advise would be extremely appreciated, I am really struggling.

jobs,1gn4z0u,2 Week Notice Struggles,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gn4z0u/2_week_notice_struggles/,3,"Hi All.

TL;DR: Have a great relationship with current company, how to submit two week notice in the most respectful, professional way possible to make it easy on everyone. My absence will leave a big hole at my current employer and I feel crappy about it. 

CONTEXT BELOW:

I’ve begun onboarding for a new job that I’ve been interviewing with for several months now. After the final interview they made me an offer that I would be stupid to refuse compared to where i’m at now. 

I’ve already signed and accepted the offer, and i’m currently finishing up some pre employment checks (background check, drug screen). Once these are done and I get feedback from my new employer that i’m good to go. I will put in my two weeks notice at my current job. 

However, I am extremely stressed, anxious regarding my employer’s reaction and the two weeks following my notice. It is a very small team, we have around 15 people in our office but I only work directly with one person (my boss who I will be submitting the notice to) 95% of the time. They have treated me very well and I have a lot of respect for my boss. When I leave, all my work will be offloaded onto him.

For one, I plan on submitting my notice in person, not in writing. I almost feel I owe him an explanation as to why I am leaving. Regardless, I know he will ask me why, I don’t see him saying “OK” and just moving on. 

I know why I am doing it, the pay and benefits are too good, and the industry is way more directed to my career goals. I just need some tips and advice for how to get through this, and make it easier on myself and my current employer. The relationship is very personal and a big part of me feels really bad considering the circumstances (they hired me out of college and gave me a chance when no-one else would).

But, I know at the end of the day I need to look out for myself. And I know that they can always fire me at-will. Even though I don’t think they would, they simply need my help way too much at this time due to the small team structure.",2024-11-09 07:38:31

It started with headaches, heart palpitations, excessive sweating, nausea and much more. My workplace told me that I needed to find out what the problem was and that I couldn't come back until I did. After 13 different doctors, cardiologists, endocrinologists, internists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, etc. and wrong diagnosis, I finally found out I have POTS. 

Basically, my symptoms flare up whenever I do anything physical. My career is extremely physical and the areas that don't require that much physical effort are really only for women (gynecology and dermatology) since being a man in those areas isn't looked at greatly (I tried getting into dermatology but was immediately shut down by most places for being a man).

My only choice now is I guess a new career or a job I can do without my symptoms popping up every 2 minutes. I'm open to suggestions and I would really appreciate any advice.

Down the line I wouldn't mind going to college again, though I'm still in debt from college and my medical expenses so I'd rather look at the possibility later after I pay.",2024-11-09 03:49:36

I've been looking for a new role and trying to break into my goal career. While this isn't my goal career it might get the ball rolling in the right direction, I managed to get an offer for what I thought was a lateral move, but I might be stepping down a bit and would get a pay cut from 52,000 to 45,000. I tried to negotiate, but the HR won't budge saying 45,000 is the max for this role. I saw (I'm almost certain) the exact same posting from a temp staffing agency stating the role was 45,000 - 50,000 and I think the company was just trying to get me directly instead of from the agency to avoid the fees. 

While I am miserable at my current role, and tired of getting yelled at by a pregnant lady, I also feel like the company doesn't value me and want to keep me. The manager is leaving on mat leave soon and they transferred someone from a different department/building to cover her instead of shifting people up already here. In addition, they are paying for this person to get certifications to be able to be in the role and did not even consider getting me certified (I'm not sure if my manager had a say in this, but I think she can tell I'm not as invested in this career as she would like and probably didn't put up much of a fight). It's kind of my fault, I've been doing the bare minimum and haven't really expressed learning more than what I'm doing now and have pretty much gotten comfortable. 

When I did the interview at this other company it all seemed nice, but there were some red flags like contacting me at 7PM for a phone screening and then just scheduling me for a virtual interview for the middle of the day without making sure I was actually available. And now I'm feeling a lot of resistance negotiating and I'm pretty sure they are lying about 45K being the max salary for the scope of the role especially since they need to fill it ASAP.

So I'm going from full time, with benefits, onsite manufacturing, 52,000 to 12 months contract full time, no benefits, hybrid (2 days wfh) office work, 45,000. While I know I can always break the contract and leave after a few months it already took me almost half a year to even get this opportunity and with the job market the way it is right now I don't know if I'll be able to get another one any time soon and worried I'll be stuck at my current role even longer. 

Any suggestions or considerations I should think about when deciding if I should accept or decline the pay cut offer?

Recently moved out of state. I knew the move was coming so I was proactive at looking for jobs about 3 months before the move. For context I am a machinist by trade and very mechanically inclined and doesn’t mind getting my hands dirty. 
I applied for close or 40 jobs mostly in my field but also a few on the fringes. So five weeks after moving I finally interviewed with two places of employment and have to make a decision. 
The first job is with a municipality doing water and sewer work. Not necessarily in my field but it’s outside and I’m using my hands. It pays about half of what I was making at my last job but has a ton of upside. Particularly the benefits (almost free for all of them) and also the opportunity to learn heavy equipment and get certified to run the equipment paid for by the employer. Also I would get my CDL A paid for as well. All of this would also get me consistent pay raises. 
The second job pays the same as what I was making. And it is more in line with my machining skills with mechanic type work in that mix. However the benefits are quite expensive. The union dues are a bit pricey and the commute is double. 
 So here’s my dilemma. My heart is telling me to take the municipal job as a change to get out of manufacturing and learn new skill sets. My mind and pocket book is telling me job 2. There is steady overtime at job 1 so I could close the gap in terms of pay and I have a part time security gig. 

So what do I do??? I’m about 90% to the municipal job but keep having doubts….",2024-11-09 03:14:06
jobs,1gm2ge8,Told not to clock in before meeting.,192,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gm2ge8/told_not_to_clock_in_before_meeting/,43,"UPDATE:

First, thank (most) of you lol kidding, but you know the one. I took your advice and tried to get them to state something in writing. I texted my supervisor, his assistant or whatever he is (he's the one who told me to not clock in), and HR. All of them received the same message, separately to give them the opportunity to mess up their scam: 

""Good morning. This is [OP].

I just wanted to reach out to confirm that my suspension is over on Monday and I'm free to return to work at that time. 

Also, I was instructed to not clock in before our meeting yesterday. I was in the building from 3:26pm to 4:18pm, and the topic of the meeting was entirely work related.

I will be compensated for that time, correct? 

Thank you""

Assistant dismissively responded first, fairly quickly:
""Please contact [supervisor] today regarding Monday. He should be in the building Monday but I don't know what time. I'm sure we can compensate you for your time yesterday. Let me know if you need anything else.""

HR responded next, just under an hour later, completely ignoring the topic of suspension:
""Good morning [OP], of course you time card has been updated.""

Lastly, my supervisor, nearly 2 hours later:
""Good morning.   Yes, I will make sure you get p aid for that time. My feeling is this is not going to work out.  You are definitely jaded by all that have trained you & we are not meeting your expectations and i dont think we can continue like this.  I think it is best that we part ways.  HR will be in contact with you for Cobra & Unemployment info.  I do wish you the best of luck in the future.""

In short, don't try to create change in an already very comfortably racist and political setting. You will lose. At least they owned up and fired me, and I start my next job on Wednesday. Good riddance. It was only ever meant to be temporary and this job market sucks, as you're all aware.

Thank you all again, and good luck!


Original Post:

Today, I walked into the building with coffee and lunch for the day in hand, and see my manager standing at the time clock. He tells me not to clock in and to come with him. We then had a meeting for at least an hour, going over the reason I left the night prior and all the things that have been piling up. I was told not to come back the rest of the week and let another manager know if I still want to work there on Monday.

All weird drama aside, I messed up by not clocking in, didn't I? I'm entitled to compensation for being there and discussing my role, parts, equipment, etc. It was all business related.

As far as ""do i still want to work there?"" goes, I do not. I hate it there. I am just curious about pursuit of lost compensation. Is it even worth the trouble?

They reached out to each contact I provided and they all responded by yesterday. So hopefully I’ll hear back next week from the company. 

The fact that they contacted my references is a promising sign that I’m likely to receive an offer, right? We already discussed salary at the very beginning so it’s not like i have to worry about that getting in the way.

jobs,1gmvd1p,Partner is losing her mind in her finance role - Advice needed!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gmvd1p/partner_is_losing_her_mind_in_her_finance_role/,1,"Hi all,

  
My partner is really losing her mind in her current job within the financial industry.

  
Her role is in London and she's contracted 35 hours salaried but with travel it's actually 50 hours realistically plus unpaid overtime that she's pressured into.

  
She's currently being overworked doing two completely different roles that have been pushed on her, these jobs are realistically two separate roles for 2 different people as they require her full attention and it's being torn between them all the time.

  
She's anxious and extremely stressed all the time and she has no work/life balance as both roles are on her mind 24/7, she also often finishes work late and skips lunches due to the demands placed on her by the company. Her manager constantly micro manages and is on her case most of the time if something hasn't been done quickly enough.

  
She decided to book two days of leave this week to get a small break from the job, however even whilst on said holiday she is still being pestered about tasks, being told that she has missed vital things within her work causing more stress and anxiety.

  
She's also been made to feel like she needs to compare herself to another one of her colleagues who joined the company around the same time, however that colleague doesn't have the same split roles and can focus on her singular job.

  
My partner is absolutely miserable at her job now having really liked it to begin with, she's been in the company for 1 year now and is coming home crying because of the stress it's causing, she enjoys the role that she originally applied for however due to the other demands that are placed on her she believes she can't use her full potential on the core role she was originally employed to do.

  
She has raised her concerns with her line manager and has repeatedly been told that if she's patient then things will improve and get easier for her. She was first told this 6 months ago and things are only getting more difficult for her as the demands in the job increase.

The company releases a daily team report of mistakes made in one of the systems and my partner always seems to find her name flagged on it daily which adds to the anxiety as others with her team can view this information, aside from that occasionally the reported mistakes on the report are very minor and / or aren't even a mistake on her part to begin with, yet she takes the brunt of the blame.

  
The salary is the only reason she stays at the job as she's paid very well compared to more local roles, however adding up all the travel and overtime hours it's probably not even that much money.

  
To make matters worse she is currently dealing with a lot of personal stress (Gran passing, family dog passing, and Mum put in a care home w/dementia all within the last couple of months.

She hasn't been able to process any of the emotions for these important personal events because of the stress and overbearingness of the job.

  
She's looked at various similar roles however due to the competitiveness within the industry jobs are posted and taken down so fast, and she can't fully mentally focus on job hunting as her current job has so much of it taken up.

I suggested to her that she should go to the GP and get signed off work for a time to focus on herself and spend more time looking for other jobs.

please could any of you kind people advise us on what she should do in this situation as it's just too much for her.

TL;DR:

Partner is overwhelmed and stressed in her financial job in London. Although contracted for 35 hours, travel and unpaid overtime make it closer to 50 hours. She's doing two demanding roles that should be separate, with constant pressure from her micro-managing boss, even on days off. Despite initially enjoying her work, the combined stress, lack of work/life balance, and pressure to compete with a peer have her miserable and anxious. Personal life challenges (loss of close family members and her mother’s dementia diagnosis) have added further strain. She's considering leaving but is held back by the competitive job market and her salary. we're seeking advice on managing this situation, including possibly taking time off to focus on her mental health and job hunt.

In fact, I had to pull everything out of the PM in pieces, but in the end this turned out to be not what was needed. In the end, they told me that I passed the probationary period, but extended the current task for another 3 months. Although the phrase ""you did a lot"" was heard, they did not raise the salary.

i am currently transitioning out of Military service and have been applying to jobs for over a month. about half way into my job search i got an offer from company A its a long move away about a 12 hour drive. but i was getting desperate and didn't want to be without a job. along my leasing agreement with my rent ending at the same time. so i took the offer. i have not started there yet but i have done all the onboarding tasks including pulling my clearance and bringing it over. and am currently waiting to confirm a start date. Today i received another offer from company B in the same area i live in with about a 17k salary bump. and it looks like they want to start me in the next two weeks. the other companies don't know about each other and i only told the job that offered me the recent job that i needed the weekend to think about it.

 i don't want to move but at the same time i don't want to feel bad about taking a better job offer and having to explain why i wont be joining them and feeling horrible for wasting their time

the more money is a no brainer to me. but also I'm tight on money and am crashing at a friends place due to my lease being over. so my main concern with the second offer is the start date being pushed back due to them taking long to pull my clearance

I took two months to recuperate and see family i havent seen in years, and then I started heavily applying around august. Ever since then I had a handful of interviews, two offers in an industry im trying to leave behind, and rejections.

  
Today I had an interview for a role that has alot of potential for growth, is very interesting, has a manager that actually values work life balance, and its in a city I have been trying to move into for a while now. I really, really want this job... and that scares me.

I dont want to become so attached to a job that its not guaranteed. I think the interview went well, and the guy mentioned next step was a panel interview and potentially an office visit, so I am not anywhere near the finish line (he also mentioned they got about 50 people interviewing for the job). They also want to have someone by the end of the year which means I would have to haul ass from texas to chicago in a month or less. I would take a 30-40k paycut too, but Im willing to do it if it meant steering my career in the direction I want, with a stable company as well.

Its a really tall order and I am stressing.

Do you guys have any tips as to how to deal with this? Im not trying to be negative but I think Im getting too attached to this possibility that its going to be potentially heartbroken if i dont get the job.

I’m in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some advice from those who’ve been through this. I’ve applied to **over a thousand ESL teaching jobs**—yes, you read that right—and I’m still stuck. **Most of my applications have either been ignored or rejected**, and the hardest part? **I can’t find any schools offering visa sponsorship**.

Here’s a bit about me:

* **Single mom** with 3 kids
* **Over 10 years of teaching experience** (high school and college levels)
* I’m passionate about moving to **Thailand** and making this work, but the visa sponsorship part has been my biggest hurdle.

Here’s what I’ve tried:

* Applying directly to schools and on job boards (just about everywhere)
* Tailoring my **resume and cover letter** for each application (using ATS-friendly formatting)
* Reaching out to recruiters, but haven’t had much luck there either

I’m feeling a little lost at the moment. Has anyone been in the same situation? **How did you find visa-sponsored roles**, and what else can I do to stand out? **Any resources or tips** I might be missing?

jobs,1gmqwm7,"Potentially getting a far smaller cubicle/office area because CEO ""wants me closer"" to them. I'm a manager. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gmqwm7/potentially_getting_a_far_smaller_cubicleoffice/,0,"Recent merger/acquisition early this year resulted in me being promoted to my first management position. I took over the role my ceo started in when they joined the company the same time I did. We work closely together, especially considering they're effectively mentoring me through my first management position. This is likely the main reason for ""wanting me closer"" to their office.

Our company is primarily remote/satellite employees since we're international. Though, the hq here has about 10 employees. Our production is ramping up, and as such, needs to take more space. That means we're condensing 4 more cubicle/office spaces into a room currently occupied by only 4 people (myself included). 

The context for this rearrangement of my space is what's not making sense... It's been told to me that the ceo, for some reason, wants me closer to their office...my space already shares a wall with their office.. 

I really enjoy my current layout. It's about 9' x 13' open layout with 2 windows, multiple bookshelves and 2 desks. My desk is literally 3-4 steps from the ceo's door. 

The current leading proposed design (worked up by a coworker, approved by the cto), makes use of the existing L-shaped 12' long by 5.5' wide by 6' tall mobile walls/dividers. 

The proposed plan takes one of those walls and puts the short arm of the L against the wall, with the open end terminating right by my ceo's door... Effectively giving me a 5.5' x 12' ""corridor"" in the middle of the room with no windows. It's a box. I could only arrange my desk one way and that wouldn't even give me enough room to lean back. It'd be by far the smallest cubicle/office space in the entire building. For a manager? 

I don't complain about anything. I've been a reliable and low maintenance employee. My ceo was promoted to ceo the same time they promoted me to their old position. While I'm certain that must be the reason to keep me that close... This feels disciplinary? 

I'm totally comfortable asking them about this, but want to make sure I'm not stepping outside my lane before doing so. Only other thing I can think is that I'm not as productive as they might have hoped? I can over think any situation though, so who knows. I'm a straight shooter though - you got a problem with me, talk to me about it and I'll adjust. 

I cna get carried away over thinking. Is it worth bringing it up and asking my ceo about this? Or just let it be? Like most everyone else, I spend more of my waking hours at work than I do at home. Going from a comfortable large office space with windows, to a narrow box in the middle of the room would certainly affect me. ",2024-11-08 19:31:26

*games. For old times' sake, here's a reminder of some of my past work: I was a quest designer*

*in \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, a mighty large project that was. There, I created NPCs, and crafted quests*

*for the \*\*\*\*\* region. I am the narrative designer for the upcoming title \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, a*

*neat little tower defense game, where I wrote a ton of flavor texts as well as the game's*

*central narrative featuring a cat invasion. I also have my own fiction series on YouTube, titled*

*A Dark Light Shivers, featuring a cult, some secret agents, and naturally, a dark god devising*

*to eat the world, well, metaphorically of course. Then I have my solo game dev project, The*

*King's Courier, where you play as, surprise surprise, a king's courier. You're tasked with*

*bidding the kings's decrees in the regions of the kingdom, and what you say affects the Kingdom's*

*Reputation outside the capital.*



*I believe that should cover the ""my experience"" section, which is also available in my*

*Resume, in the summarized form if you fancy a shorter read. I checked my previous cover*

*letters before writing this one, so I know I typically mention my technical capabilities around*

*here, but I feel like that might bore you, so I'll just list them real quick: I can use Unity,*

*Unreal and Ren'Py as engines, I'm pretty savvy with Articy: Draft for branched narratives,*

*and I'm familiar with workflow tools and software like Monday, Jira, Excel/Sheets(duh),*

*Confluence galore. Yep, that should do. Oh, and I've recently started to study computer*

*programming, not sure if this helps, but I wanted to share it with you, cause why not?*



*Well, alas I think this is all for now, old friend. In soothe, I realize this third time will*

*probably be the last, as I'm quite tired and weary of the process and don’t want to trouble you*

*further with more rejection emails. Hence, I'm ready to let go after this last round. But*

*attempts. I hope someone on your end sees it, too.*

I’m looking for tips on acing interviews—especially when it comes to the final stages, whether that's an assessment centre or face-to-face interviews. I always seem to struggle here. Lately, it feels like recruiters expect responses using the STAR method, but I’ve always preferred expressing myself naturally rather than feeling robotic by following a set technique. Any advice on handling competency-based questions more effectively?

I’d also love some tips on performing better at assessment centres. If you've got any strategies that have helped you stand out, I’m all ears!

Hello, I’m looking for a part time job that has flexible hours. It’ll be my first job, so I’m open to any and all advice!

Right now, I have two jobs I’m considering.


Dog Walker/Sitter

Pros
- I like dogs
- Walking dogs is good exercise for me

Cons
- Exercise
- Irrational fear of getting mugged and/or something bad happening when walking on the street

Food Delivery

Pros
- I like driving
- I can have a GPS on me
- It’s pretty straightforward
- Lots of companies to choose from (GrubHub, UberEats, etc)

Cons
- Gas is high (+$4 where I live)
- Customer Service
- From social media, it doesn’t look appealing?

Those two are the ones I’m researching more on, but I’m open to any other suggestions!

Because I was bored I went to the first zoom meeting she asked me to join where she emphasized on how she only wants to recruit mostly women for female empowerment and how this is a great way to make a part time income of 2-3K by working 8-10 hours a week.

She also mentioned that there's going to be training and licensing for 8-10 weeks where my ""income"" will be utilized towards the licensing process. After the meeting she sent me instagram handles of other people who work with her and they all look like they're trying to create content about financial freedom.

I'm actually confused because how does this even work? It doesn't seem like a scam as much because the people are real and they seem to be involved. According to what I understood, I won't be getting paid for the first 2-3 months because at least 8-10 weeks are gone towards the licensing process. When I asked about it, she said that it's because if I did another job as a financial broker I'll have to get certified by myself but with them, they help me throughout the process. It makes sense but I know I'm not the best at detecting scams lol.

I told my coworker this, who u knew before she got hired. She said she wouldn't know how to approach it and fears her managers reaction. 


Anyway, fast forward, she gets a personal project at work, a great opportunity  and I'm happy for her. (More on this later)

I work in IT support. At our job, we have tiers but they don't come with raises as of now, but management informed me they're looking to change it to incentivize people to stay with the company and move up another tier. I mention when the time comes to get promoted to a  different tier, I hope we get a raise. 


My coworker then says she notices i talk about raises a lot and if money what motivates me. She then says as a new grad employee she should prioritize growth over DEMANDING a salary increase. Her example was if she turned down the personal project because it didn't come with a raise she would be shooting herself in the foot.

A), I never suggested she ask for a raise for a project. I never said she should demand a raise for the project.  I only suggested she ask for a raise before our annual review period months earlier. 

B ) I never suggested chasing money. I do believe in advocating for yourself at work and try to get the best dollar you can get while keeping your options open but I would never suggest turning down opportunities at work because they didn't come with a pay raise associated with this.


C) I turned down jobs that offered more money because the job I have now offers great work life balance,upwards mobility, free continuing education, and pay for my bachelor's degree should I want to pursue one, thus setting me up better in the long run. 

 So it threw me off guard and I was offended.  

I told her, I often talk about opportunities and impact but you choose to focus on me talking about raises and explained my reasoning.  She apologized but I just don't know how a statement ""I hope we get a raise"" turns into ""you only care about money and you will turn down opportunities if raises aren't associated with it. ""

I could really use your advice on a situation I'm dealing with at work. I'll give a detailed explanation to give you the full picture.
I've been with my current company for over two years and, up until recently, I've been very happy with the work environment, my colleagues, and the overall atmosphere. However, things have taken a turn since a new guy joined as the team lead for the project I'm on.

The previous developers on the project all left due to his poor leadership. They raised concerns to higher-ups, but it didn't seem to change anything. This new lead is still in place, and the situation has only gotten worse.

To summarize:
* He doesn't take feedback well and frequently lies to the client and even his own manager.
* He raises unrealistic expectations with the client and misrepresents our progress.
* On top of that, he's technically incompetent and spends more time ordering people around than actually contributing to the project.
* Worst of all, if you point out his mistakes or question his decisions, he becomes defensive and will attack you when he gets the chance.

I've tried to address the issue professionally by talking to higher-ups, but it seems like he's untouchable and has some support at higher levels.

As a result, I’m feeling increasingly stressed and demoralized. It’s affecting my mental health, and I’m honestly considering leaving the company because of him. But here’s where I’m torn:
* Should I stay and try to put up with it? Maybe it will prepare me for handling difficult leaders in the future.
* Or does leaving make me seem like I'm giving up, letting this person win by driving me out?
* Should I just leave and prioritize my well-being, even if it feels like escaping the problem?

I’m not sure what to do and could really use some advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

jobs,1gmcp1l,I rejected a big opportunity. Did I make the right choice? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gmcp1l/i_rejected_a_big_opportunity_did_i_make_the_right/,2,"I joined a startup a couple months ago, and I knew it would be fast paced so I mentally prepared myself for it. I joined as a specialist in a specific area of marketing as I’d rather be an expert in one thing rather than have a 360 role. 

They knew this from the get go as it’s something I always make clear in interviews, and they were okay with it as they were looking for someone with that expertise. When I joined I was told I’d handle two projects that fall into my expertise, which was perfect for me. 

However, after 3 weeks of getting used to the projects and the fast paced environment, I was approached by my boss and their boss and was told they had a big opportunity for me. 

Basically, they needed someone to lead a new line of business in the company. This would require me to have a 360 role as I would need to plan strategies for every marketing area our company  works on. 

I was shocked and didn’t know what to say, but told them it sounded great. Having been on the company for less than a month, i felt like I didn’t have much power to say no, so I decided to say I wanted to try it out. However I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was what we call in Spanish a “poisoned present”, which means they needed someone to throw that responsibility to, and chose the new coworker since they didn’t want to give that to the rest of the team.

The three of us immediately started to have weekly calls where I needed to make presentations and tasks on things I had zero experience with. At the same time, I got “promoted” (just in title, not in salary) to lead of a project that fell into the umbrella of this new line of business so I could get the experience.

To say I’ve been overwhelmed is an understatement, and this week my anxiety was at an all time high. I decided it was time to be honest and share what I was feeling. in previous companies I always kept my discontent to myself, and that always led to resentment and being unhappy and deciding to leave the company. I didn’t want that to happen this time as I was actually happy with the projects that fell under my specialization.

I had an urgent meeting with my boss with whom I shared I wasn’t sure I was truly prepared (experience and knowledge wise) for the new line of business, but I wanted to search for solutions with her and I wanted us to work it out so it didn’t impact the company negatively. 

She was IMMEDIATELY understanding, which surprised me because it sounded like she also wanted to get rid of this (from day 1 it was clear it was her boss’ idea). She told me we would drop the new line of business weekly meetings and that in the future, when we had to choose someone for it, it wouldn’t be me. She also appreciated my honesty and told me I was right in everything I said, and that she wanted to keep me in the rest of the projects as she was happy with my work and how fast I was adapting. 

And honestly, I don’t know how to feel, I feel extremely relieved, but I also feel weird because I’ve been told by friends and family that this was a huge opportunity that could have leveraged me into very high paying jobs in the future. However all of those promotions did not come with more salary (I’m almost minimum wage as it’s a startup) so in that sense I don’t feel that bad.

Please let me know what you think and if there’s something I’m not seeing. Thanks!!

I'm sooo upset with how it went and havent been able to get over it for the past several days. It was my first interview for a job since I graduated nursing school couple years ago and havent worked (due to mental health). For a hospital floor I was rly interested in too. When I get nervous I get a runny nose and idk why. It's happened throughout my entire life and its so stupid and gets in the way of when Im presenting, talking to people, etc my nose literally just starts leaking like Niagara falls. Of course that happened during the interview, there were 4 ppl I was talking to, and I was so embarassed. I also choked on some water on literally a small sip and had to cough  which I think just made me unprofessional (this was just 2 quick coughs so this was honestly fine it didnt bother me much). But it was really my runny nose, I had to stop twice to wipe my nose with a tissue. I literally knew it was gonna happen so I made sure to have one. It was just so embarassing and I'm mad because other than that, I wouldnt say the interview went super good, but it didn't go bad.  I think it was the way I said it too, I dont think it would've been horrible if I said ""excuse me Im sorry I have to get a tissue"" or ""one sec sorry I need a tissue"" but I just was embarassed and reached in my purse to get a tissue and said a quick ""sorry"" before I wiped my nose and after. And they just all looked at me and said ""its alright"" but I feel like I made it  awkward and I was just embarassed to have to do that during an interview of all things. I just had to rant cuz I feel like this was my only chance to make a good impression and get a job because I havent been able to get interviews..been getting rejected due to my history which I regret so bad.I feel like I ruined any chances I had.

jobs,1gm9joa,Recruiters/hiring managers/talent acquisition experts what makes a candidate the one who gets the offer?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gm9joa/recruitershiring_managerstalent_acquisition/,8,"I need some advice on interviewing. I’m fortunate in that I’ve become good at finding jobs that I’m a good fit for and applying early and landing interviews, but it’s been difficult making it past the second or third interview and landing the job. I must have done at least 50 interviews this year alone. 

How do I position myself better as a candidate?

Flaws I do have are that I get anxious sometimes in interviews, and ramble when I’m not prepared for a specific question. How do I better project confidence in this situation? It’s hard to be prepared for every possible question. Would a short specific answer be better than trying to be detailed, and would stating that I can elaborate after be bad. I know the SAR method is often suggested. Would it be good to memorize answers structured this way? What makes a candidate’s answer outstanding?

In the case where I have made it to the third interview and they went with another candidate, how do I stand out? I do understand that there are a multitude of reasons why these choices are made and that it might not be that I did anything wrong in particular.

But I wanted to know if there are specific behaviors or ways of answering questions, talking, that make people seem like the best or better choice. It’s a struggle to figure out how to make an impact in a series of 30 minute interviews. Why did the 1 candidate beat out the 10+ 30+ 50+ 100+ etc.?

Also do you think there is any potential unconscious bias in that I’m an African American woman with a very ethnic name? I don’t speak in AAVE or Ebonics (I don’t think either of those are issues or should be but I know that for some they can be). I also wear glasses and have a bit of a baby face. Would wearing my contacts and makeup make me look more professional and put together? I would never do heavy makeup, but I don’t know if should try wearing light makeup. I do dress (business casual) and groom nicely, but I never go all out. Would wearing a blazer or something similar help? How much does appearances really play a factor?

Summary: 

I’m looking for advice on improving my interview performance. I’ve gotten good at finding jobs that match my skills and landing initial interviews, but I often struggle to make it through the final stages. I tend to get anxious and sometimes ramble if I’m caught off guard by a question, and I’m wondering if concise answers are better when this happens and if I should rely on structured methods like SAR. I also wonder how to make a lasting impression in the later interview rounds given how many people I’m competing with, and I can’t help but think my appearance or even my name might subtly impact how I’m perceived, since I’m an African American woman. Would small changes, like wearing light makeup or a blazer, make me appear more polished?

I was a Hostess Busser and then I got moved to Take Out. I’m also 17F. Everything was fine the first month. The second month I got written up for ‘being on my phone too much and not having the motivation to do my job’. My grandmother was in the hospital and my managers knew that. Ever since then, I feel like my managers have been out to get me. I couldn’t work Sundays because of ACT prep, and my manager scheduled me every Sunday even though I had told him I couldn’t work. He then threatened to write me up. He didn’t because the regional manager chewed him out for it. Since I had gotten written up, they tried to make me quit by scheduling me once a week. I busted my behind to get scheduled more and proved myself as a valuable employee, and still then I was treated coldly. My manager started expecting me to put work first instead of school when it started back up again, which was crazy. He told me he would fire me if I went to a college more than 30
minutes away. Anyways, I busted my butt and got promoted. Ever since I got promoted to Take Out, he has been on my behind. I’ve taken off for things that I need to do like drivers ed, JROTC events, and college visits. He rarely gives me time off. My breaking point is when the schedule came out today and he gave two people off of my birthday and birthday weekend. I took off 11/21 and 11/23 for my birthday in SEPTEMBER and he gave those days to two other coworkers who put the time off after me. Usually, he gives time off to those who put their name in the time off book first. He gets mad at me when I do my job better than my coworkers, gets mad at me if I don’t do something he asked me to do even though I’m helping customers, and he gets upset when I don’t run over to pick up food when I’m putting orders in. It feels like he’s singling me out. I legitimately don’t know what to do and my dad won’t let me quit. I’ve heard HR is useless and they don’t care. I’ve asked coworkers and they told me to suck it up. I need legitimate advice. I’m sorry if this seems so jumbled together i’m so frustrated and angry right now. There is definitely more that my manager has done and my mind is blanking right now. I want to quit this job so bad but I don’t know if i can or how to.

Although there is a “hiring freeze” in this position, I still see it listed as accepting applications on indeed. 

I have another member on my team, who does one aspect of their job well but can’t do any of the clerical/management aspect, but they’re doing fine and have not gotten any negative feedback due to their lack in that aspect. 

I’ve actually been asked to do more, which I thought was great at first. Now I realize I’m over performing but not getting anything out of it. 

So would it be worth it to perform as well as my team member at this point? I’ve already been downgrading the extra tasks that I did that weren’t assigned to me, but I’m wondering if I should only do as much as my team member.

Now, I’m worried because first of all I didn’t ask the name of the company and what I tought was the name turns out that is the company that rented the warehouse. And in second place they asked me for my ID and SSN so I’m worried they could use for something illegal.

The place didn’t give me good vibes, it’s dark as hell and there’s no windows to the outside so it feels a claustrophobic. Also, the manager’s phone numbers has the Maryland code area so I find it a bit strange but considering that maybe he came down to Florida where I am.

jobs,1gm8alb,HELP!! - not sure what internship offer to take,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gm8alb/help_not_sure_what_internship_offer_to_take/,0,"I'm currently a junior in college studying Marketing and Business Analytics. I've spent the last year working part-time for a local State Farm agent as a sales rep, but recently have been applying to other internships mainly because I want to move out of state when I graduate and there's little room for advancement at my agent's office so it doesn't make sense for me to stay there after college. 

I've gotten two internship offers and I'm really not sure which one to take.

First offer is with State Farm corporate in auto claims. They'd send me to their corporate hub in Dallas, TX.  Pay is $22/hr with $2000 stipend. My current supervisor knows I've been actively applying to State Farm internships and I have strong interest in working for State Farm corporate after graduating. The only issue is, I don't like claims and have zero desire to work in claims after I graduate. During the interview, the hiring managers said they have a very high return offer rate for their interns. 

  
Second offer is with USAA corporate as a product analyst located at their corporate office in San Antonio, TX. Pay is $26/hr with $2300 stipend. My supervisor doesn't know I've been applying at other companies outside of State Farm. The role is something I'd be interested in, however during my interview I was told that being comfortable with big data sets is crucial and that there's a lot of work with Python, SQL, and Snowflake. I told the interviewers that I had no experience with any of those and that my main knowledge is in PowerBI with limited knowledge of Tableau. Honestly I didn't expect to get an offer based off that so I was very surprised when I got the phone call today with an offer. Also when I asked the hiring managers about the probability of a return offer, they said it was a ""decent"" chance but that not everyone gets a return offer. 

  
I have seven days to accept either offer -- I also have an interview this Tuesday with another department in State Farm. Help lol

  
TLDR: Really not sure what to do here. Got two internship offers, one with my dream company with a high return offer rate in a role I would hate with slightly less pay. Other offer is with competing company with a role I'd be very passionate about and enjoy, and would get paid more. BUT have zero clue on how to utilize tools that are very necessary to the job (SQL, Python, Snowflake). Any advice welcomed!!!

I wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar or if I’m just taking it too personally. Here’s what happened:

I submitted my application early last week, but the hiring manager was on annual leave and didn’t review it until Monday. I then got scheduled for an interview the following Wednesday (just two days later), which felt a bit short-notice. I thought the interview went really well and even received positive feedback, but unfortunately, I didn’t get the role.

The way they communicated the decision was what felt especially off. I missed two calls, and they left a voicemail saying to call back. I tried calling three times and even sent a text, but when they eventually called back, they informed me in a quick conversation (during the school run, no less!) that I didn’t get it. They mentioned that my interview was strong but that someone already in their team had applied and outperformed me. I get that these things happen, but the whole process just left me feeling like an afterthought.

Have any other UK-based folks experienced something similar? Is this just part of the hiring game here, or is it reasonable to expect a bit more consideration and clear communication, especially when a candidate reaches the final stages?

Now I have been back working as an Administrative assistant because it is reliable.

I recently changed jobs because I was getting so bored at my old office. I was able to negotiate a hefty pay raise with the new job, but I have been sitting in a chair doing almost nothing for four days.

I know I shouldn’t complain because I am a making good money, but they are so low key they are afraid to show me how to print a mailing envelope in case I get overwhelmed (face palm). 

I just want to stay at this position until I retire in 5 years, but I don’t know how I can do this.

When it was my birthday she texted me on the night of my party, saying she had had a nap and now wasn’t going to bother coming. I set up three lunches with her at work in January February and March, everytime she suddenly declined on the day, without apology. There is another colleague who I stopped talking to, since she was very toxic towards me. She told the first friends’ boyfriend to contact me and harass me about why I don’t talk to her anymore. Of course I didn’t give any details or drama for them to fuel off. Now the first friend is asking me to the party and I said no as I’m scared the old toxic friend will be there and the first friend has not been a good friend to me anyway. Since I said I’m busy and can’t make it, instead of just saying oh no worries, she texts me with “how are you doing anyway? I never see you around work now and you take days to respond. That is unlike the person i know you to be. Did I upset you? I am really concerned about you”

Despite the fact the last text I got from her was 3 months ago and the last time I saw her was in September where she only wanted to see me to get gossip about my life. 


How would you respond to this painfully annoying text ? I don’t want to give them any information and want to make it clear, I don’t do parties now with them. If she is sooo bothered or concerned about me, then she can ask me for a coffee or lunch at work, but she hasn’t. Sounds bothered. ",2024-11-07 23:02:42

I’m looking for advice because I’m in a tough spot. My first official job was with a company that treated me horribly. I started my career a bit later in life due to raising kids and had completed a 10-week introductory course before landing this role.

Over time, the work environment became toxic. My last few months were especially rough—they even demanded explanations for my therapy and denied any reasonable flexibility in my schedule, despite being able to offer it. Eventually, they fired me.

I was transparent with my new potential employer about the issues I faced, explaining the mistreatment and the personality mismatch at my previous job. I made it all the way to the final stages and was set to start in just 10 days when I got a call saying they couldn’t move forward because my previous employer gave me a bad reference.

I feel defeated. My self-esteem has taken a hit, and they’ve caused ongoing issues with my records with HMRC, making it hard to move on. Do I have any options to fight this bad reference, or at least prevent it from impacting my future opportunities? Any advice would be really appreciated.",2024-11-07 22:24:23

It's now an hour later and I feel it may have been a bit too harsh and maybe shouldn't have messaged in the heat of the moment. Was it too mean? ",2024-11-05 18:07:48
jobs,1glyzd8,Second thoughts about starting new job. Is it a bad idea?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1glyzd8/second_thoughts_about_starting_new_job_is_it_a/,1,"To preface, I’m in the accounting industry and have held 4 major jobs now in my 7 year career. I thought I could handle public accounting, and left and came back a time or two before settling into my current FP&A role. 

I’ve been in my current job for a year. I’m a FP&A analyst and it’s essentially going to take a while to get promoted. They don’t promote here like they do in public accounting and I hate it. No bonuses, abysmal raises, and a pretty bad financial outlook to be honest. I love my team. My manager can be a pain and she’s a total micromanager, but I feel like if I stick it out (and not get laid off), I could make a good career here. 

A friend recommended me for a senior tax analyst position. It’s a 20% raise, awesome growth opportunity, bonuses and equity options. My family is financially struggling right now and could really use the money. I accepted the job but second thoughts are beginning to surface..

- What if I get bored doing tax only? In FP&A you learn a lot.
- What if it’s a bad idea working at the same company as my friend?
- Taking this job makes me even more of a “flight risk”. Do I really want to start all over again?

 I’m trying to trust in myself to make the right decisions, but my record leaves me somewhat embarrassed and makes me question myself. Is it a bad idea to take a new job? I’d like to think I had good reasons to quit those other jobs in the past, as I’ve undergone so many life changes in my early career. From moving to a husband and two kids, life changes your perspective sometimes. All I want is to find somewhere I can be happy for a long period of time. 

Advice is so appreciated, thanks! ",2024-11-07 19:35:58

jobs,1gb50mm,I got my toxic supervisor fired after writing an honest email my last day of work. How should I feel?,974,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gb50mm/i_got_my_toxic_supervisor_fired_after_writing_an/,308,"I worked for this company for 6 years, and since day one I watched them co worker treat employees under him like absolute garbage. He was good friends with the supervisor, so he was almost considered above the rest of us. over the years, multiple complaints were filed on him to the head of the building (we have no HR reps on site and their contact info is kept under lock and key) The supervisor always found ways of burying any complaints against this guy. He even eventually got promoted to co supervisor, and things only got worse from there for everyone, but ESPECIALLY ME since he was my official boss now.

After a total of 6 years, I had enough. I was constantly yelled at, belittled, jokes made about me (from my boss!) about how bad my work was. I was so angry walking the halls of that place, I finally found another good job, and made the switch.

On my last day, I sent an honest email about why I left, thoughts on the current company culture, my experiences throughout my time, and ways I think they could improve. (I was never asked to do a formal exit interview... shocking). I thought it was extremely well written and professional, making sure to put nothing in it that wasn't absolutely true. I made sure to copy on this email as many people as possible, going all the way up the chain of command to a couple corporate HR reps.

about 2 weeks after I left, there was a new manager (over basically everyone else in the building). This was in late June.

I was told by a friend who still works for this company, that this new manager questioned why there was never any follow up on my email, and the complaint seemed to just be buried (again, shocker right?). This manager asked an HR rep from corporate to visit the building, and investigate further.

They read several complaints from years past on this guy, as well as putting out an invitation for anyone who wants to write a letter to do so. Basically saying that anyone who wants to complain CAN, and they'll actually listen this time.

They ended with 11 new complaints over the course of a week (not even counting the ones from years past from past employees who also left because of him).

I was just informed today, October 24, that he is being fired by the end of next week.

I'm honestly just filled with a lot of emotions right now. Not sure how to feel because it's obvious this was my fault. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice for this kind of situation???",2024-10-24 15:14:11
jobs,1g7wem0,New boss asked my political affiliation during my first day...,835,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1g7wem0/new_boss_asked_my_political_affiliation_during_my/,411,"I said, calmly: ""I will tell you what I tell all employers - I will let you know when I leave the company.""

The rest of the day was smooth sailing...There was no tension at all when I responded but that was a question I have never been asked.

He was 100% asking because he asked where I went to college and my degree and made one huge assumption. And I know we are not on the same team so to speak.

Anyway. 

Ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, how fucked am I?

I am currently sitting peacefully at my desk at work. Time will tell!",2024-10-20 11:16:57
