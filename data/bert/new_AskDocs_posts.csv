AskDocs,1gq2ne4,My husband has been having vomiting episodes for nearly half his life. Who do we go to for help?,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq2ne4/my_husband_has_been_having_vomiting_episodes_for/,40,"My husband (31M) has been having these episodes since he was a teenager. We’ve identified a few triggers like eating spicy food right before going to bed. 

Sometimes he vomits for an hour and sometimes two days. He’ll drink water and gatorade and it comes back up within an hour. If he doesn’t drink anything, he vomits bile. 

These episodes come and go randomly — he’ll go months feeling fine and then be puking once every week for a month. 

Sometimes sitting in a hot shower helps, but otherwise he’s stuck until it passes by itself. Bright lights make it worse. 

He went to a doctor about this when it first started, but they shrugged him off. Now he’s hesitant to go back because he thinks it’s a waste of time. But he can’t function once the puking starts and I hate to see him suffer. 

My main question is, what kind of doctor should he go see? Our insurance doesn’t require referrals for specialists, I just don’t know if that’s the route we should go. What do we bring up to ensure he gets taken seriously? Any information about what this might be or what direction to go would be very much appreciated. He’s miserable and I have no idea how to help. Thank you for your time

Edited to add: every morning he wakes up extremely sensitive to taste and smells. Most mornings he wakes up nauseous but doesn’t always puke",2024-11-13 02:34:18
AskDocs,1gq5eqn,Help me solve this mystery that’s stumped 10+ medical professionals in the last 48 hours ,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq5eqn/help_me_solve_this_mystery_thats_stumped_10/,37,"I’m a 25-year-old female with a fairly unremarkable medical history: I have asthma, had a tonsillectomy at 21, and had mononucleosis at 17. Recently, I found out my iron is low (39), and I have an elevated CRP level. Possible shingles in 2023 though I absolutely believe a sloppy ER misdiagnosed a jellyfish sting. Today, my Covid, RSV and flu tests were negative. I have not really changed detergents or anything. My skin is not sensitive. I have two cats but they are very clean and visit the vet regularly. They do not go outside ever. 

The main issue started several months ago with an intermittent, itchy rash on my neck, which seemed to flare up only at bedtime. I applied Benadryl cream as needed, but since it was inconsistent and mild, I didn’t think much of it.

Last Friday, I developed severe sore throat and flu-like symptoms, and the neck rash flared up when I was going to sleep. I tried Benadryl cream again, but by morning, it was much worse. Over the weekend, it continued to worsen, so I saw a doctor Monday who suggested it looks like contact dermatitis at face value, though she admitted this didn’t fully make sense, as I hadn’t changed anything in my routine and the rash seemed to coincide with the illness as well as being isolated to one spot. 

Yesterday, after the rash became even more inflamed, itchy, and painful, I went to the ER. The doctors ran tests but didn’t find anything definitive, though they tried consulting dermatologists. They prescribed steroids to help with the inflammation and suggested I see a dermatologist and rheumatologist. But they were completely stumped and kept saying how strange and confusing this was. 

I’m kinda anxious about it and in pain, looking for answers, as the rash is in a highly visible spot and has been pretty resistant to treatment so far. It’s left a nasty and noticeable scar which is going to be a great accessory when I’m on vacation Thursday. :( Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Has gotten excruciating lower right abdominal pain 4weeks ago. They thought it was appendicitis, she was reviewed by the paediatric surgical team. Her clinical examination was appendicitis. However she had bloods taken + ultrasound. Ultrasound could not visualise appendix but all the other organs looked normal and no secondary inflammation was seen. Her bloods were mostly normal, but an elevated CRP of 5.4 and elevated ALT of 70. She was admitted for observation and they started her on intravenous antibiotics (Co-amoxiclav). She went home 3 days later. She finished off the antibiotics orally at home (it was a 7 day course in total). 4 days after completing the antibiotics, she had the excruciating pain return. She was in so much pain she couldn't even walk. Took her back to A&E, where they took new bloods and did an abdominal MRI (since her appendix couldn't be visualised with an ultrasound the last time). MRI comes back normal. Bloods are also still normal (but ALT is still slightly elevated at 50 but CRP has come down to 2.1). She's admitted for observation again. She was screaming and crying from the pain they gave her morphine. This helped the pain a lot. She gets checked out by physio to see if there's any muscular/skeletal issue at play. Physio does their assessment and they say they are happy from a muscoskeletal perspective.

Doctors suggest pain might be functional abdominal pain. We go home. She's back to excruciating pain with the morphine worn off. Paracetamol and ibuprofen don't even begin to touch the pain. And the pain is specific to the lower right abdomen. And it hurts to press and release. She is bed bound. Barely getting sleep through the night due to the pain. She is unable to attend school anymore. Her pain has been written off as functional abdominal pain. I can't watch her screaming and crying every day and night in pain.

AskDocs,1gq9qo0,"My father died, the reason was totally unexpected for us, I need to know if they did what they should in the hospital.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq9qo0/my_father_died_the_reason_was_totally_unexpected/,2,"Last Monday, my father was feeling uneasy. From what I saw on the outdoor camera, he was having trouble breathing. He called the ambulance himself, got into bed, and waited. Prior to this, he apparently had some issues. I heard he had been coughing up a little blood and feeling unwell, but he had problems with alcohol over the last year, and the people at home thought it was related to that—like some kind of withdrawal symptoms.

Some info about my father:

He was 53yo, smoked a lot, drank a lot (because of the divorce from my mother) no known medical issues but that's mostly because he was not checking himself ( he had a fear of hospitals, and had depression issues. Some weeks ago before this he has issues Issues with bowel movements, accompanied by blood and had for years issues with mucus in his mouth but we were thinking that was because of his smoking.

On Monday, the ambulance came. They initially said he was having a myocardial infarction (I’m not sure if that’s the correct term, but that’s what Google Translate says). They stabilized him and took him to the emergency room. That’s when I was called and got on the road. That evening, at around 6:00 PM, he was pronounced dead. They said they had tried to revive him for about an hour but without success. If I remember correctly, they said he was intubated at that point.

The next day, I attended the autopsy at the hospital morgue. They said the cause of death was some kind of bronchopneumonia. They explained that he had likely had this condition for a while. His lungs were full of mucus, which eventually blocked his breathing. He also had an enlarged liver due to alcohol consumption, but that wasn’t the cause of death.

On his death certificate, I have the following information:

* **Direct cause**: Cardiorespiratory arrest
* **Antecedent causes**: Acute respiratory failure
* **Intermediate morbid conditions that led to the condition above**: Clear lobar pneumonia of the right upper lobe
* **Morbid conditions that contributed to the cause of death but are unrelated to the morbid condition that directly caused it**: Aortic atheromatosis, stage 4

I’m asking all of this because the medical system in Romania is a mess. The hospital in my region is one of the worst, and I need to know if they did what they were supposed to do or if they made mistakes that led to his death. They’re known here for not valuing human life. When he was dying in the ambulance, one guy from the team was searching for a ladder to pick some grapes.

Earlier this year, there was a scandal involving the ambulance system in my region. There was also another scandal in a hospital in Bucharest, where they were accused of intentionally neglecting patients to free up beds and get more funding. It’s all a mess. I just need to know the truth.",2024-11-13 10:15:22

When I was really young, I regularly hurt myself out of distress. It wasn't until middle school health class I learned about more formalized ways of doing this, like cutting yourself. I tried once, it didn't do much for me, but somebody noticed and made a comment that prompted an image in my mind of a mutilated wrist.

I have continued to think about this mutilated wrist atleast once a day. Sometimes I think about it on purpose and make it worse, so it is just exposed bone and that is being cut away too. I have drawn it before and now see it more like a movie in my head.

I want to clarify, I am not a person that regularly cuts myself. I am fairly well-adjusted and a very accomplished person with friends. However, I can't shake this feeling that this is important to me because I continue to see it. Often times, when I am upset I think that if I could carry this out it would make my life better.

Is it possible that I haven't burnt this image into my head by thinking about it so much? Is there any truth to what I think?",2024-11-13 02:40:47

Here is where I'm worried…I auditioned and landed a BIG part in our winter performance. Like I've been dreaming of this. I was practicing bar routines alone when I started feeling really, really unwell. I was sweaty, I thought I was going to throw up, and then I tried to sit but couldn’t. I had a dream that felt really long and woke up on the floor. The back of my head was warm, I touched it and I was bleeding so I think I hit the bar when I fell. It wasn’t too bad- it stopped on its own. I stopped and went home early and went to bed to try and sleep off the head pain.

So this was last week…I took a day off even and told them I was really really sick, but even taking a day off didn’t seem to be enough. I have nausea and headaches on and off all day. They’re horrible. It’s starting to make me emotional. I keep getting really angry over small stuff and crying over small stuff. Honestly I’ve been a bitch this week and I’m forgetting easy things. 
Could I have lost too much blood from the cut? Or could these headaches still be from falling and hitting my head even if it wasn’t a bad injury? 
I’m worried because it’s not going away and I am struggling but I don’t want to risk losing everything I worked so hard for or seem like I’m not committed and I’m making excuses over a headache you know? It’s really competitive and I don’t want anyone else to take my spot. Can dancing with a headache make them worse or cause something bad to happen?

So like, today at around the end of school I got a pretty bad migraine, my head hurt like hell and I had this weird blind spot in my eye. Walking back home was a nightmare. Anyway, I got back home and immediately felt like I was going to throw up, so I went into the bathroom and waited. Eventually I did, but because I hadn't eaten since the morning (I left school at around 3:20pm) it was just bile. And lots of it. I was still gagging and coughing a lot even when there was no bile left.

I went downstairs to take a painkiller and swallowed it down with some water, and to my surprise, I threw up again, but it was of course just water. However, it was a very light red in colour, not clear like I thought it would be. This freaked me out as my brain instantly thought blood, and I went onto Google to try and find what was wrong (Not the best idea, I know) and didn't find any answers that catered to me, so I came here. So basically my question is, why was there a little bit of blood in my vomit? Did I create a tear in something from the excessive throwing up of bile that I was just doing? If there is, will it heal on its own or do I need medical assistance? This is the first time this has happened, and only happened after the bile. I'm pretty worried, and my parents won't take me to the doctor because they don't think it's anything. If anyone has an answer I'd be extremely grateful.",2024-11-12 22:47:34
AskDocs,1gq7tte,How can I help a loved one who (possibly) deals with haphephobia?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq7tte/how_can_i_help_a_loved_one_who_possibly_deals/,1,"Hello r/AskDocs!

I'm here hoping to receive some guidance on how to help my girlfriend (18f) deal with what we believe to be haphephobia.

(Before I begin, I'd like to mention that this problem does not deride from a case of abuse of any kind. I understand that's a common reasoning for others, but my SO and I have been open about talking to each other about those topics, partially due to her fear of being touched.)

We recently started dating a few months ago, and at first she was distant (no hugging, hand-holding, kissing, etc.) but I was fine with that. To quote the Beatles, I've ""learned that love was more than just holding hands"". Over the course of a couple of weeks, though, she started to express her thoughts and feelings, explicitly telling me how she wanted to do all the aforementioned ""couple"" things, but that she didn't know how. So we've slowly eased into it, and now we do all those things, albeit only when we're nearing the time when we have to say goodbye for the night.

But there are situations like the other day that worry me. I found out quickly that she can't handle back scratches/rubs/massages and when I tried doing it, she began to show signs of an anxiety attack and cried. She kindly asked me to stop, telling me she was freaking out on the inside. So I did, and when she calmed down, we continued about our day as usual.

She told me later that night that she was sorry for asking me to stop, and that she hoped I didn't feel embarrassed or upset (I didn't, I just listened and moved on). She explained that she thinks she feels things differently from others, and that it felt like there still had been a hand print on her back since that moment. She then went on to tell me about how she's changed a lot (or at least, her parents told her that) since we started dating. She's apparently started giving hugs to her grandparents, willingly snuggled up against her mom, and has been a generally happier person. She's also started initiating kisses and asking for hugs (calling them her stress relievers) not too long ago. But still having specific triggers (like back rubbing) that prove to be tough for her to handle.

I recognize that there's been a lot of progress already, but I'm running out of ideas and don't want to lose momentum. I want to see her overcome all her troubles and anxieties. So doctors of reddit, what can I do to help her with this? If things like medicines or therapy are possible good solutions, how can I bring that up with her in a loving manner?

Thank you. Please ask any questions that may help with answering my questions.",2024-11-13 07:48:27

My daughter is 15 years old. 6 almost 7 years post myeloablative BMT for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with an additional first diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis with asm qualities. She was TPN dependent and on a Benadryl drip before she was diagnosed with HLH for 1.5 years due to the SM. She had 105* fevers every two weeks like clock work for almost six months before she was diagnosed with HLH. 

She has been mostly health since transplant. Over the last six months she has been having issues where she gets out of breath when walking. Last January she had a PFT done and they said it was “not reliable” because of attitude or the perception of effort that they saw. This kid went through hell for years an hated drs. She’s also a teen. She’s going to roll her eyes but I know for sure she did as asked. She’s not one to not do what’s asked as she know if it gets a bad result she would then have to see more drs. 

Anyway. About a week go she sent me a screen shot of her Apple watch. It had an alert on it that said “you’ve been resting for 10 or more minutes and your heart rate is above 120bpm”. I checked her health app and she has gotten 9 of those over the last month. I’ve checked the watch heart rate against a pulse ox and it’s pretty accurate. I also noticed that her heart rate range when walking is 134-194.  She said her and her friend just walk around on campus during lunch but they haven’t been doing that as much because she’s been getting out of breath. 

This kid doesn’t play sports. She’s 5’0”. She weigh 90lbs. We’ve fought tooth and nail to get her over 80 lbs the last two years. (She has food texture aversions)

She’s been flushed in the face almost every day after school when i pick her up. She’s exhausted no matter how much she sleeps or does nothing on the weekends. Over the weekend we watched her heart rate more and it wasn’t under 120 unless she was sleeping.  I’m terrified. Her pediatrician ordered a chest xray, labs and referrals to cardio and pulmonologist. 

Her labs came back fine other than these:
Her total cholesterol is 170
LDL is 108
HDL is 29
Triglycerides is 167
Non HDL cholesterol is 141
Cholesterol/HDL ratio is 5.9
A1c 5.1
eAG is 100

I’m terrified. Her PFT last year was “bad” but not reliable. Then gave us a list of symptoms and things she’s at risk for and it just makes the worry worse. 
Here is a link to the chest xray they did.

For almost 6 years I’ve had stomach pain consistently. I’ve done pretty much every diet possible and the only thing that helped a little was low FODMAP, but it didn’t make enough of a difference to be worth it. I’ve done several rounds of omeprazole with little success. 

I often feel nauseous and tired and I get sick easily, and I feel like when I get sick I’m sick way longer than my husband even if we have the same thing. 

I get acid reflux pretty regularly (twice a week). 

I always have at least one canker sore, offer 2-3 at the same time. Once I had 14, including ones on the back of my throat and was prescribed magic mouthwash then sent home. 

Weirdly, while I was pregnant my symptoms seemed to get more mild. I had way less cramping throughout that time period. PP symptoms have come back swinging. 

My biggest concern is that I often feel totally normal and then I’m rushing to the bathroom to poop suddenly. The diarrhea is always accompanied with pain in the abdomen and it’s frequent enough that I think I must have hemorrhoids because the stool is sometimes a little bloody, but barely. It’s 2-3 times a week every night, on and off 7pm and 2am. 

I’m curious if this sounds like anything and how I should approach a doctor for testing. What’s the protocol? Will I need a GI reference from a GP? I’ve seen doctors in the past and they’ve sent me home with acid blockers without running any tests. Thanks for any help you can offer! ",2024-11-13 08:23:18

18F, about 210lbs now. Since I was like 13, and up until the age of 16 I was a healthy, slim weight, this thing has happened to me where when I don't eat for even a few hours I start to physically shake and feel bad. I assumed it was normal, whenever this happens I just eat a biscuit or something, but what happened yesterday freaked me out.

I am on a calorie deficit right now because I want to lose weight, alongside doing more walking. I am eating about 1500 calories a day to estimate and have done for the past week or so. This is what those calorie counting apps recommend for me.

Anyways I hadn't eaten much that day and made a nice meal for myself, just some good soup, and as I was eating it about 10 minutes in all of a sudden my heart rate went crazy fast, my body felt hot and sweaty and heavy and I felt like I was going to be sick, I was shaking real bad, the room spun, I actually felt very similar to the time I took an overdose which scared me a lot. Even now I haven't eaten as much as I usually do and i'm feeling shakey but i'm also anxious to even eat in case it happens again. 

Is this because I am overweight? 
How can I avoid this next time?",2024-11-13 05:55:26

My boyfriend (26, male, 6'4"", 200 lbs, no medications) has been experiencing allergic reactions every night when I spend the night. It only happens when we’re either falling asleep or already asleep—he feels like his throat is closing, which jolts him awake. He then goes to another room to sleep, but I can hear him coughing and struggling for about 30 minutes to an hour. He describes it as a tightness in his throat. We initially thought it might be due to my cats, but he spent months around them without any issues and he had his own cat till a week ago (passed away). To avoid carrying dander over, I keep clothes at his house that I wear while I’m there, shower and change there, and make sure to avoid carrying any dander when I leave my house. However, last night he had a reaction even though I hadn’t seen my cats in two days, had showered at his house, and was only wearing clothes I had washed there. I’m wondering if it could be sleep apnea, but I didn’t think sleep apnea would cause him to struggle after waking up. He doesn't have insurance or else we would just go to an allergist, so i just wanted some general advice.

I’m f14 & since I’ve been about 9-10, I’ve had some odd (mainly autocannibalistic) urges.  Within the last two months or so these urges have amped up quite a bit.  I just wanna preface none of this is sexual/a fetish & is an actual psychiatric concern!

For some context I have currently diagnosed autism, adhd, bipolar disorder, & I have been psychotic before.  Mental illnesses & neurological disorders run in my family.

My previous cannibalistic urges started when I was 9-10 as stated & consisted of me biting/licking my skin & licking up blood from scrapes.  It was always odd, but never a huge concern.

Recently it’s amped up past the point of autocannibalism & more or so wanting to consume human flesh In general.  I first noticed this when my mouth was basically watering whilst watching a zombie movie & I found myself wanting to be a zombie consuming flesh.  After that incident I’ve payed closer attention to how I almost fantasize about sinking my teeth into flesh or celebrating when I get a scrape so I can taste the blood.  It’s gotten just gross atp, but I feel like a mindless doll

Obviously I’m not gonna eat anyone or myself, but I desperately want answers to why I could possibly be having such weird urges.  It’s concerning & interesting so if you have any ideas please help out.

In 2017, I had a sigmoidoscopy and endoscopy, which revealed 1st-degree hemorrhoids. In 2021, I needed another colonoscopy due to constipation. The doctors confirmed I have IBS and recommended hemorrhoid surgery as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I couldn’t afford it at the time. By 2024, my condition worsened, so I had to undergo the surgery. During the colonoscopy, they found a polyp and performed a successful polypectomy. Then I had my ligation and laser operation for the hemorrhoids.

After the operation, I experienced severe constipation. My doctor tried all types of laxatives, even probiotics, but I still feel like I have a hemorrhoid. I consulted a gastroenterologist for the constipation, and although his medication initially caused frequent diarrhea, it eventually helped. However, I still have to go to the toilet multiple times, and there’s mucus discharge.

I also started experiencing significant hip and leg pain. After a diagnosis, the doctor found I have arthritis and a vitamin D deficiency. The combination of arthritis and constipation has made life incredibly difficult. Recently, I had sudden fevers and severe stomach pain, especially after eating spicy foods, which I now find unusually irritating. I also feel pain and a burning sensation under my rib cage and in my stomach.

Eating and drinking fine. He has idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia. Brought him to the GP, BSL 5.6, temp 36.7, spo2 94%, HR 120 approx. GP was mainly concerned about the heart rate and even though he was alert and orientated, he had 2 minutes of ‘zoning out’ or something.

Based on the severity and type of injuries, are there any specific injury patterns that could indicate whether I was sleepwalking or intoxicated when I fell? For instance, do sleepwalkers or intoxicated individuals tend to land or fall differently?

Additionally, are there any signs that could help determine whether I fell because I was leaning over the window or if I might have ""jumped"" intentionally? Any insights on this would be helpful as I try to understand what happened. Thank you!",2024-11-13 09:59:37

I don't have problems with pooping in general. In fact, I would say I evacuate a healthy amount on a daily basis. However, despite the size of my stool (which can be shockingly large at times) I always end up having a little bit stuck in my body with no chance of coming out. I've tried pushing to no effect, I've tried sitting on the toilet and waiting, and I've tried pushing it back up far enough as to where it'll be included in my next toilet session (I can physically feel it retreat back into my body). 

Because of this evacuation problem, wiping is now a giant hassle. There are days where I'm wiping for more than 30 minutes because the toilet paper is still dirty from the leftover poop inside me. When I do end up cleaning it all and go about my day, I experience leakage as to where my anus gets dirty and requires multiple sessions of wiping a day.

I drink more water than anyone I know, and I love eating fibre focused cereal, so neither of those are an issue. I've been looking online and I just can't find a solution on how to get everything out without such a hassle. If I could get some advice or recommendations I'd greatly appreciate it.",2024-11-12 14:06:08

Allergy to dog+cat fur/dander. Asthmatic. Runny nose/sometimes wheezing depending on exposure; visiting people with animals is fine but I need a zyrtec for these animals (in a small studio apartment).  
  
Hi 👋 I'm in the most lasting, healthy/serious relationship I've been in, and my partner has a big fluffy dog and a fluffy cat. We're considering moving in together in a few months when their lease is up, and I've been taking it for granted that we'd figure some solution or compromise for my allergies- right now I take OTC allergy pills every time I come over because we mostly hang out at his house, and his animals are lovely- they want me to pet them and be their friend; I want to oblige; so I take the pills and wash my hands after. Normally I feel stuffy and my sinuses are acting up after being over, or before the allergy meds kick in. Lately the roof of my mouth and my sinuses have been inflamed, I'm not sure if this is related.

I'm interested to move in with him and was imagining having my own pet-free zone, we already know we'd like separate bedrooms, but with our budget I'm wondering- is that a floor of the house? A bedroom I sequester myself to, only worrying about not touching the (affectionate) pets when I come out? Would that mean I'm asking him to sequester himself and his animals to the basement in a 2 or 3 floor? Etc.

He says he's open to getting the animals groomed regularly which would help with fur, but they really are very fluffy. I already have a bunch of lintrollers because I wear a lot of black for work.

I'm wondering if there are ways to help reduce allergen effects, good allergy meds for daily use, creative solutions as far as home layout that might help, if a bunch of HEPA air purifiers would do the trick- anything like that. I've heard pet dander can be pretty pervasive and work it's way through the HVAC.

I'm wondering keeping a large-enough pet-free zone would be admissable with daily claritin or zyrtec, if this can even work etc.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",2024-11-13 09:16:14

I have extreme early satiety. Like five saltines and I am painfully full.

Consistently full feeling, never hungry.
 
Extreme satiety and discomfort/pain after eating. It feels as if the food is sitting in my chest it can sometimes cause nausea/vomiting. 
Mild dysphagia.

I’ve had just about every scope on my digestive track that you can think of, and the only result has been mild gastritis/GERD

My last gastric emptying test (last month)was a bit strange but was “normal “

Computer analysis finds that
49% of the gastric contents have retained at 60 minutes
47 % at 121 minutes.
8% uptake retains in the stomach at the end of the study 180 minutes.

I was curious about the timing though. For the first few hours I was feeling super sick, like food was sitting in my chest , but guy was like if you throw up you can just go home... I retched but nothing came up. Is it normal that took three hours to digest maybe one egg (didn't finish full portion), and only moved from 49% to 47% from 60 mins to 120 mins? 

Last years was different 

Gastric emptying 5/12/2023
Clearance times:
60 minutes: 39% (normal < 70% and > 10 %)
120 minutes: 80% (normal> 40%)
240 minutes: 86% (normal> 90%)

But I can’t eat and I’m fainting a lot. I’ve had several concussions from fainting and hitting my head. My electrolytes have been out of whack and I’m really scared and at this point I don’t even know what to ask the doctors to look for and because eating causes so much discomfort I don’t even wanna try but it boils down to is I know I have to eat to live and I want to live , but something is wrong.

A while back and FNH was found, but I was told that it would have no impact on my GI issues. It was never biopsied and hasn’t been rescanned in two years. Meanwhile, I continue to fade.

TW!!: Suffocation/DV
First off I would just like to preface saying I know this will be a long read, and I know I can only receive accurate recommendations and absorb others experiences, however I truly feel at my wits end. Just for some background, I just turned 19, I have always had low iron/anemia issues, and I have a family history of hole in heart and murmur issues (heart in general) and I am a smoker, I just quit nicotine disposables but engage in 420 friendly activities often.

Over the past couple of years I have had some extremely scary instances passing out. The first time this happened was years ago, I am not aware of how long I was out, however during me passing out I had experienced a loss of bladder, which I know is usually uncommon. These symptoms came and went over years, with me only ever feeling “super super” dizzy once every 6 months (if that) and before this year only passing out/fainting a couple times after the original spell.

In the middle of January, I experienced suffocation and hypothermia at the hands of my ex partner. In late January/Early February I had a bit of a hardcore night partying (only 420 activities were engaged in, nothing else.) and passed out after going to school and then standing for about 30 minutes the next morning. About 2 months later, about a month after I had got free from my ex relationship, I had been standing around a fire with my family for about 20 minutes and passed out/got sick to my stomach.

As summer came I became VIOLENTLY ill. Dizzy every time I stand up, heart beat as fast as a race horse even when just laying in bed, chest pains, passing out and shaking, sweating x10 more than ever before, increased anxiety and worst of all extremeeee fatigue mixed with anxiety induced insomnia. Not going to bed until 2,3,4 am and not waking up until 12,1,2 pm. I have the feeling of impending doom and my chest caving in constantly. It’s the scariest feeling I have to live with. I have been to doctors, the ER, Urgent Care, and worked with a neurologist. I have experienced loss of sensation in my left side (eye and reflexes) and as of mid July my Iron test came back at a…get this. 4!!!!. I have tried a mix of vitamins, iron, magnesium, etc…, have switched diets and tried to decrease anxiety but, nothing helps.

I’ve been told I don’t have POTS, but I know how hard a diagnoses is to get, especially at my age. I have heart issues in my family history as mentioned, but after EKG’s and having my heart checked numerous times, I have never had any abnormalities, skips, or irregular beats. Im really hoping someone (even though I hope you haven’t lol at the same time) has experienced this so I can have some sort of feeling that I’m not letting myself get worse and worse if it’s something serious. Idk if I’m overlooking an issue that could be caused from the physical DV aspect or I’m completely overlooking an actual medical condition that I haven’t thought of :( I don’t want to give up and say it’s just stress and smoking.

currently taking claritin 1tsp a day and eye drops as needed (tobramycin/ dexamethasone USP .3/.1)

my daughter normally has very bad eye allergies. we've tried multiple different eye drops and gently washing her eyes with baby shampoo as directed by her eye doctor. she pretty much has swollen and crusty eyes most of the time. nothing seems to fully help.
today she took a nap and woke up saying she couldn't open her eyes. she got scared and cried which I'm sure only made it worse.
both eyes are swollen and red. the right is now worse, discolored on the outside with the top lid so swollen it's protruding over the bottom lid.
I gave her motrin 7.5 ml and have been alternating cold eye masks for her. she attempted to open her right eye and she began to cry again saying it hurt.
what else can I do? does something like this warrant an ER visit or wait until tomorrow? picture attached below.

My doctors aren’t listening to me and won’t see me because they think it’s just a stronger case of pins and needles, imm tired of being made to feel like i’m crazy because i’m young.

I’m eighteen, this is putting my life on hold, i can’t keep jobs because of these episodes but nobody wants to listen to me.

Both of my legs go completely numb for a solid minute straight then a pain starts happening about halfway through and i cant move at all without being in agony?? I don’t know how to explain it at all but when the pain starts happening, if i move my legs at all (including my feet and toes) it immediately feels like my nerves are on fire.

I lose movement in my legs but it isn’t extreme enough for me to catch on video, they become really stiff and if the numbness->pain-> stiffness happpens when i’m standing my legs turn to jelly and i end up on the floor not long after.

These episodes can last from 30 seconds to several minutes, then they go away. This happens more than once a day and are becoming more frequent, the most it’s happened in one day is six times.
My hands also have the same problem, but instead of stiffness i just can’t move my fingers on my own. They don’t lock up or go stiff, i just can’t make them move, if that makes any sense?

I’m sorry if this is just pins and needles and it sounds like i’m exaggerating.  It’s so difficult to explain this to somebody when i hardly understand what’s happening myself.

It’s gotten to the point where i’m considering searching for mobility aids or potentially seeking private healthcare — If it’s relevant, myself and most AFAB members of my family show various signs of hEDS and have arthritis diagnosis’.",2024-11-13 08:21:01
AskDocs,1gq88kq,Can someone please help me understand my mom's autopsy report?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq88kq/can_someone_please_help_me_understand_my_moms/,1,"Female  
55  
Her medical history includes:  
Diabetes, insulin dependent  
Hypothyroidism  
Hypertension  
High cholesterol  
ADHD  
Depression  
PTSD  
Umbilical hernia, repaired  
Liver cirrhosis  
Gallbladder removed  
She would have fluid retention unsure why, but I knew I was related to her alcoholism  
Vaped nicotine  


My mom passed away on 4th of July this year. It was very unexpected. I have some questions that I honestly don't know if they matter or not but maybe it would help me grieve. 

1. To clarify, the report is speculating that she passed away from an arrhythmia (like v-fib) right?  

A. If that's the case, would it have been painful?    Would she have been aware something was wrong?  

2. My mom was an alcoholic for about 25 years. However she had not had a drink since March. It states in the report that she had been drinking the day prior. I never said that to the police. All I stated was that she was an alcoholic. I DID say she would also abuse RX meds, and had been for about the last 12 years. To be honest I assumed this entire time she OD'd trying to chase a high from her gabapentin, buspar and/or tramadol and told police this.  

A. Obviously NAD, but from what I could find on the internet, the gabapentin was really high in the toxicology, high enough to be considered an overdose but it's not even mentioned.  
B. The ME suspected beer potomania. I'm not sure if it matters but my mom never drank beer. She liked vodka, wine, opiates, benzos and weed. And as previously stated, she hadn't had a drink since March. Especially would have been impossible the 4 days before her death to drink.  

3. The days leading up to her death.. she was visiting me in Texas from Montana. She would come down every year and stay for the month of July. I picked her up from the airport on July 1st. She was there mentally but had tremors and weakness. I had to work the 3 days I did get with her so most of the time I was asleep or at work. But the little time I did get with her and from what my partner reported, she started vomiting, had diarrhea, slurred and difficulty speaking, barely ate, fell a couple times, and slept a lot. I thought she was detoxing from something. She knew I would have sent her home if she brought something to abuse to my house. I checked all her bags when I picked her up and where I live, it would be impossible for her to get something without asking one of us for a ride. I figured it was a combination of detoxing and trying to get some sort of high with her buspar, gabapentin and/or tramadol. All that aside, the morning before her death I noticed I could see her pulse in her neck. This was not normal for her. From other videos and looking at anatomy pictures I believe it was her jugular. I was beating so violently I asked if she was okay, she said she didn't feel great but blamed it on possibly being her antidepressant and/or needing to take her BP medicine. I tried to find my BP monitor but couldn't (ironically found it looking something else about a week later) I probably would have saved her life if I looked harder.. anyways, I told her to let me know if she felt like she needed to go get checked out. I don't think any of that was relayed to the ME, especially since I was so distraught when the police were there I don't remember even telling them. I was just so sure she had OD'd like the thousands of time we told her she would if she didn't stop and I made that well known to the police.  
  
Even though she was an addict, she was really good about taking her meds, blood sugar and regularly seeing doctors. She was even seeing a cardiologist for about the last two years. How did he not see this coming? 

This post ended up being much longer than anticipated. I appreciate anyone who reads it all and responds with some sort of direction. Below is a link to a PDF of her autopsy.

My concern over him trumps my own worries. I'm scared he'll Google as I've done and read that. I'm scared how he'll feel. He internalizes a lot and it festers as anxiety and I know what that's like and how isolating and terrifying it is. I don't want that for him.

Female Age: 29 Height: 5’4

Hello everyone. I had an ear infection a few weeks ago that I cleared up with antibiotics. My TMJ has gotten worse but I saw a dentist, TMJ specialist, and ortho who told me my teeth and tongue look good and I have a geographic tongue. I had had a bitter taste in the back of my mouth and it looks like it’s scaly and white. I floss, brush my tongue/use a tongue scraper and mouthwash, and it’s still there. I also bite my tongue in my sleep but my dentist is ordering me a night guard for that and I should get it in 1-2 weeks. I saw the ENT and he took a look in my throat and said it’s just yeast and not thrush because I don’t have sores in my mouth. He prescribed my nystatin four times a day. The buildup usually isn’t seen until later in the day and I saw the physician at the ENT pretty early in the day so the buildup wasn’t there. I have a bicuspid valve is this ok to take? II’ve never had this taste in my mouth before and I’m also not sick and not on any medications currently. Thank

8 days ago I was walking in platform shoes and fell/rolled my ankle. I felt immediate pain and couldn’t weight bare. 

There was minor swelling and bruising along the side of my foot and on the toes. 

The worst pain was the night after, I couldn’t sleep. 

I thought it would get better and the swelling/bruising has gone down but I am still in pain when walking.

The pain is localised to the outside of my foot under my ankle bone. 

I finally got an x-ray today after putting it off but can’t get in to my doctor for another week or so. 

Does my foot look okay, or should I try to get into my Doctor or maybe a physio sooner?

AskDocs,1gq78mb,"Addiction to nasal spray, is there any point in seeing a doctor? ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq78mb/addiction_to_nasal_spray_is_there_any_point_in/,1,"29F, been addicted to nasal spray since I was 16 years old. I got addicted after a regular cold. Before this I had no troubles with stuffy nose and I also (as far as I remember) slept well.

For the past 2 years I have been struggling a lot with sleeping. I often wake up with an extremely stuffy nose, almost unable to breathe and a really bad taste in my mouth (most likely from sleeping with open mouth?). This has really become a problem for the last couple of months since it's completely ruining my sleep. I can never sleep for more than 2-3 hours, I always wake up feeling like I can't breathe. I have to take nasal spray immediately, wait for about 15 minutes - but then I'm already awake and unable to sleep again. Usually it takes a couple of hours before I can fall asleep again.

This is an embarassing issue to me and it's hard to describe how bad it is. Let me say this; quitting smoking is 100 times easier than quitting this shit. When quitting smoking I could breathe and fall asleep. I can't do that (at least properly breathing) with that extremely stuffy nose. It gives me headache, horrible taste in mouth (and dry mouth, where remedies work for like 2 minutes and then it's dry again) and of course I get frustrated, irritated and no sleep when it's so stuffy.

I do not know what to do. I just requested an appointment with my doctor, but I cancelled it 15 minutes after because I realized there's probably nothing they do. I'm not even sure if I'd get sleeping pills to at least get through the first nights, but to be honest I don't think it will work (but worth the try, maybe).

I want to quit this shit so badly. It's frustrating, I can deal with a lot of things but my nose being this stuffy is just horrible. I do not hold track on how much I use during daytime, but if I have a really bad day where I cry a lot I will use it after crying since it gets extremely stuffy then and won't loosen up unless I use nasal spray. I assume I use it 1-2 times during the day, and 1-2 times in evening and night (once when I wake up at night, once again  when I wake up after falling asleep the second time). I always need a spray after waking up as I get stuffy immediately upon falling asleep it seems like. However I have decided to start tracking this in case I do end up not making it and have to see my doctor. I might not realize how often I actually use it so there is a chance it's more than 4 times during 24 hours.

Please help. Again, quitting smoking is just fun and games compared. I'd quit literally everything before I quit this. I don't understand how it's possible to quit it cold turkey. How will I sleep? How will I get through the work day?

And if my mindset is the problem then please help me with that but I assure you I do not overreact about the breathing. It's so so horrible. It also hurts for me to breathe for a long time through my mouth, my teeth are of course damaged by my mouth being this fucking dry for years so they are really sensitive.

When I sleep I have cold bedroom, I have a really good bed, I sleep with my head up high. I haven't feel well rested in months. I also have to mention that when I cry a lot (I sometimes have bad breakdowns due to depression) I get so stuffy I almost choke on myself. It gets so stuffy that snot is just pouring out without me being able to draw it back in lol. Also I can't blow my nose because again, it's completely stuffed. So crying is horrible and I need nasal spray straight away. 

I think I should try literally everything before seeing a doctor. But how far shall I take it? Can I even get a normal nose after being addicted for 13 years? Now I haven't used nasal spray in 5 ish hours and I breathe perfectly fine, so I do not think the issue is anatomic.",2024-11-13 07:04:38

For the last few years I've had the following symptoms:
Shortness of breath, joint pain, rib pain, headaches, abdominal pain, butterfly rash, arythmia, tachycardia, raynauds symdrome, and fatigue

I tried going to doctors at the onset of symptoms but it all got dismissed as being a lazy teenager with anxiety. The symptoms were annoying but they came and went and were pretty manageable.

About 2 months ago I got out of an abusive relationship, and then I got really sick and chalked it up to my immune system being trashed from the stress. I went to the doctors, they did the standard covid, flu, and strep tests, all negative. I got a bit better and then a week later I got sick again this time tonsillitis. After that whole ordeal all of my previously mentioned symptoms ramped up really bad.

I waited a bit because usually the symtoms go away after a week or so and I can get on with my life, but they just kept getting worse. The joint pain got so bad that I had to start using a cane to get around, I'm so exhausted and pained that I spend most days in bed. When I do get out of bed my energy is just drained so quickly. The rib pain has been my biggest issue, I can barely move and turn at all without a quick stabbing pain somehwere in my ribs, and it doesnt help my shortness of breath.

We went to the doctor and she ordered a Vitiman D lab, and an ANA with CBC differential to check for an autoimmune issue like Lupus. In the meantime prescribed a 2 week course of an anti-inflammatory. The medicine seemed to help the pain a bit but after about a week I was right back to where it was pain wise and had developed peripheral neuropathy, making it even harder to get around.

We got the lab results back and I have a bit of a vitiman D deficiency, the ANA came back negative so it's not autoimmune, and the CBC revealed a heightened platlet count (473, the range is 150-450)

She latched on to the vitiman D deficiency being the answer and prescribed suppliments. I'm sure that can explain some of my symptoms, but it doesn't feel like a vitiman D deficiency alone is enough to cause thus kuch pain and mobility issues. She dismissed the platlet count altogether saying that 20 points out of range is normal sometimes, but she could order another blood test just to see. 

The second test came back the other day and my platlet count has risen and is now 497 she just got back to me today saying that she has no idea what could be causing the spike in platelets and she wants to check one more time. She's refering me to a Rheumatologist and a Hematologist, and she's ordering an X-Ray of my chest and spine.

Im going in this afternoon for the finals test she wants to run, but I'm just starting to get scared. My symptoms seem to be progressing so fast and we don't seem to be any closer than we were a few years ago.",2024-11-13 06:35:19

AskDocs,1gq6kx1,Advocating and management of symptoms before likely lymphoma biopsy ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq6kx1/advocating_and_management_of_symptoms_before/,1,"Hi, I’m posting this for my mom. She’s been dealing with a mix of worrying symptoms and recent test results, and we’re concerned about possible lymphoma (maybe Hodgkin's?). I’d like some guidance on how to help manage her symptoms and questions to ask while we wait for her biopsy and treatment plan.

67, Female, 5'1, 115lbs (down from 128 3 months ago), Caucasian.

**Clinical Summary:**   
Diagnosed with COPD and left breast cancer (no lymph node involvement); completed chemo and radiation; currently on Herceptin every 3 weeks.

Recent echo showed pulmonary artery pressure increase from 30 to 53 in four months.

**Symptoms:**  
For the past two months, she’s been increasingly fatigued, with a loss of appetite and a general feeling of being “unwell.” I’ve noticed in July a steady decreases in her lymphocytes and increases in neutrophils on her labs, but nobody was concerned

**Recent Labs:** 

* HGB: 9.5, RBC: 3.65, HCT: 29%, Platelets: 384 (all down \~10% from 3 weeks prior)
* Lymphocytes: 13.5%, Abs neutrophils: 7.7 (both trending in opposite directions over 2 months)
* WBC: 9.9
* Iron: 12, TIBC: 227, Iron saturation: 5%, Ferritin: 119. Reticulocytes and Folate are normal.



**Other Health Issues:**  
Noticed leg swelling a few weeks ago, which worsened until she couldn’t sit comfortably. Oncologist nurse didn't seem worried, but her PCP ordered an ultrasound that showed a DVT; she’s now on blood thinners, iron supplements, and Lasix.

**Imaging:**  
Chest x-ray showed right hilar enlargement. CT showed a 2.6x2.5 cm right hilar lymph node, a 3.2x2.7 cm mediastinal lymph node, and other enlarged lymph nodes leading up to the pre-tracheal level. Everything in the abdomen looked good. Comments said atypical for metastatic but worrisome for malignant neoplastic etiology.

Since starting treatment, her leg swelling has gone down, but she’s still weak and sleeping most of the time. Appetite is only slightly better.

Her oncologist’s nurse said her lab results wasn't alarming and advised waiting until her next appointment on the 20th (same phone call they said not to worry about her leg swelling). They also mentioned she’s ineligible for an iron infusion because her ferritin is normal (I found this confusing). They have sent the referral for a pulmonologist. 

I’m trying to advocate for her and understand the right questions to ask. I don’t blame her care team—I know our local hospital system is stretched thin and under a lot of pressure to see as many patients as possible. But her constant fatigue and steadily increasing heart rate (90 a few weeks ago, now 120 resting, normal BP) are worrying.

What questions should I be asking in the mean time? Should I be demanding anything? I fully understand it's probably cancer, but, last time with breast cancer it was confirmed In November and treatment (after surgery) finally started in March. ",2024-11-13 06:18:59

But when I'm laying down, I don't feel the heaviness on my chest at all. I believe this feeling started when I tried to do a push-up challenge of more than 50 per workout session and I workout twice a day, which results in 100 push-ups, but I would sometimes finish between 80-90 instead of going all the way to 100. 

I've always worked out for years and did chest exercises even push-ups, but never going to 100. I do believe that the push-up challenge I did 9 days ago caused some kind of muscle strain in my chest from overworking my chest area for the challenge. I started feeling it the day after and I thought it was just normal and my chest muscles will heal again soon. So I haven't been doing any chest exercises since then, but up until now, I still feel the heaviness in the middle of my chest right between my breasts and it's really making me feel like I might get a heart attack or something. 

I do not have breathing problems. I'm breathing fine even when I'm still doing my other types of exercises for working out. But once in a while, whenever I'm standing, sitting or walking, the heaviness will just randomly show up, making me rub my chest to try to 'cool' it down It doesn't show up when I'm working out or eating. It shows up at the most random times of the day like when I'm just sitting down doing stuff on my computer or when I'm standing, talking to someone.

Hello, I'm a 31M

For about 15 years I've had issues with my pelvic reigion, abdomen, lower middle back, and hip pain.

I've gone to the doctor for it several times and they've done an MRI and ultrasound but during the ultrasound they mostly looked at my abdomen, testicles, and pubic bone. I always come up empty handed with no answers.

In the beginning of my symptoms I mostly just had left testicle pain that would radiate to my abdomen and left hip. Physical activity like running made it worse and sometimes the pain would be so intense I would vomit.

Then the lower back pain started and if I did activities that required jumping and impact on my legs I'd be bed ridden and could barley walk without back spasms and testicle pain.

These days I still have those symptoms but now I'm also experiencing penile pain like a sharp stabbing/pinching pain on the top middle of my shaft. Sometimes my pubic reigion and penis feel numb, my legs and feet primarily the left one frequently have the numb tingling feeling, and my calf muscles are very tight feeling. I also have difficulties keeping an erection, delayed ejaculation, and dull orgasms. Sometimes I get a sharp pain in my perennium and strain when trying to fully void my bowels.

The symptom these days get worse when sitting or lying on my side. It's also impossible for me to flex my kegel muscles for longer than a few seconds and it makes the pain worse. When I was a teenager I jumped over something and tripped and landed very hard on my tailbone but never seeked medical treatment for it so idk if that's related. I also have type 1 diabetes.

Any ideas of what could be to blame? Thank you in advance. ",2024-11-13 05:46:49

I've tried asking my doctor about this discomfort before and all she said was to keep it dry and wear cotton and use a diaper rash cream when it's starting to come back.

I'm getting to a point that I'm tired of how often it's happening and the pain that's being caused by it. The area is dry as best as i can make it, and any moisture that exsists is no different than any other normal body moisture that would existin a place like an armpit. It gets itchy, and then I notice a layer of skin coming off and the skin left behind is shiny and almost scarred and either lighter in colour or even sometimes almost purple.

I wear as loose fitting clothes as I can and shower daily. I'm at a loss and don't know if it's just a part of being a heavier set person now, or if I really need to push for an answer as to what is happening.

It first started as palpitations, a feeling that my heart was pounding against my chest causing pain and a lot of stress. I was short of breath when I tried to walk. Went to the ER and they did the basics (chest xray, ECG and bloodwork) and nothing abnormal. They said that it could be anxiety, lack of sleep, too much caffeine, etc. I thought that it made sense. It's true that I've been under a lot of stress but I was a bit scared because I had never experienced symptoms like this. 
3 weeks later, again chest pain but this time more like a pressure on my chest and shortness of breath at rest. I thought that it was a panic attack since the symptoms came out of nowhere, lasted for about 15 minutes and I cried a lot after as I felt like I was losing control. 

2 weeks later, I started having severe back pain in the centre upper back and chest pain on the left. This time it felt more like a stabbing pain that would not go away. Day after day it got worse to the point where any movement and even swallowing would hurt so much. I also developed a small cough. I didn't want to go the hospital again but the pain was the worse I had experienced. 

At the hospital, the blood work showed that my d-dimer was elevated (2,788) and aPTT low (22). On top of that, I take the contraceptive pill. They decided to do a ct scan to look for PE and a quick chest ultrasound later and it showed nothing abnormal. They said that it is pleuritic chest pain but they have no idea what is causing it. They gave a prescription for an antacid and I am feeling a bit better now. The pain is still there but not as constant. 

I know this is Reddit but any ideas what could be causing this? especially for the most recent episode of pain. They recommended that I follow up with a cardiologist but with the information they gave me, it doesn't seem to be a heart problem.

AskDocs,1gq5h1u,Mysterious elusive leg pain???,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq5h1u/mysterious_elusive_leg_pain/,1,"Personal info: 20F 5'5"", I take vitamin B12 + D3 as well as some antidepressants and Adderall but those aren't the issue, I have celiac and eosinophilic esophagitis and a bunch of allergies and asthma. My mom suspects I have ehlers danlos, could that be what it is? 



Hi. I've been having leg pains ever since I was a kid, and my mom always told me it was growing pains. Makes sense. Well I haven't been growing (height wise at least) for 5 years now and it's STILL happening and the doctor has said it's probably nothing. Please help, it's awful.

It almost always starts at night. Sometimes if it's really bad, it lasts into the morning of the next day before it goes away. It's also only ever in my right leg - never my left. Weird. It's NOT restless leg syndrome - it starts way before I start getting sleepy, sometimes around 5pm, more often 9 or 10pm. It feels like a dull but strong aching inside my leg bones, usually in my thigh the most and extends up to my hip, but it extends down my shin as well. When it's really bad, I can feel little sharp shooting pains down my leg. Ibuprofen and tylenol rarely help, and sometimes it keeps me up all night because of how painful it is - the kind of pain where you're shaking due to the intensity. But sometimes it's mild and never causes an issue. And it's usually gone when I wake up. Here's another weird thing: it occurs irregularly frequently, but certainly not every night. Sometimes it'll happen 5 nights in a month, sometimes 5 times in a year - I've gone a few months without having an issue, but sometimes it feels incessant. It rarely happens two nights in a row.

Maybe it gets exacerbated with stress? Maybe it's a mineral deficiency? My mom keeps telling me to take vitamins. But again, this is only in one leg. This has been bothering me since childhood and it ruins my entire night on days where it happens.

I had an X-ray and my doctor said it looked 100% completely normal and unremarkable.

Any ideas? I'm in the throes of it right now and it's hard to think of anything else. Thanks!",2024-11-13 05:09:07

AskDocs,1gq5fgd,What’s wrong with my liver?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq5fgd/whats_wrong_with_my_liver/,1,"Hi all. 25f, spent 4 days in the hospital last week due to an infection that is still confusing to me. I’ll explain in detail, but they diagnosed me with strep throat, a UTI, proctitis, and suspected PID. They were especially concerned because something was wrong with my liver. The hepatitis tests came back negative but my liver enzyme levels were very high, and the US mentioned that there was “Increased echogenicity of the portal triads.”After a week, my liver enzymes are still elevated (AST at 123, ALT at 154). AST levels have gone down significantly (around 600 when I went in) and my ALT levels began going down but appeared to have jumped back up again. Nobody really knows what’s up with my liver…they say it might be Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome from the potential PID or it might be a result of my drug use (which I’ll explain), but no definitive answers. I’m in no pain and not having any symptoms, and my doctors aren’t concerned because the levels at least were trending down, but seeing those numbers so high has really been stressing me out. 

So…what happened. Well, please don’t judge me, but I struggle with addiction and had a bad relapse after a period of sobriety. I ended up having very rough sex and used drugs (methamphetamine and cocaine) for 2 days. I ended up with a fever and went to the doctor, who sent me to the ER. Negative for all STDs, but the CT showed pelvic and rectal inflammation, hence the proctitis and potential PID, and I came back positive for strep throat. Because of my high WBC and elevated liver enzymes, they determined I had some sort of infection and pumped me full of antibiotics for 3 days. But by the time I went home, they still didn’t haven’t any real answers about my liver.

One doctor brought up Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome, but I’m skeptical since I’m not in any pain. I’ve also never heard of meth or coke impacting the liver like this, but of course I could be wrong. 

I’m also worried because my RBC, HGB, and HCT, which were already below the normal range when I went in, are appearing to trend downward, and nobody is saying anything about it. Not sure if this is related or even something I should be concerned about…I just hate seeing abnormal results and not getting feedback from my doctors. 

So there it is. I’m going to rehab in the next few days so I don’t keep endangering my body like this. If you have any idea what might be going on with my liver let me know!",2024-11-13 05:06:26
AskDocs,1gq5ezt,Heartbeat in my ear,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq5ezt/heartbeat_in_my_ear/,3,"Let’s just get right into it because there is a lot of context. Female 22 and the problem started about a year ago. About three years ago I developed an incredible amount of different symptoms that eventually caused me to become bed bound. I was sleeping 16 hours a day, and every time I stood up I felt like garbage. I found the only time I didn’t have symptoms was when I was laying down. Every time I stood up I became incredibly dizzy, nauseous and I would even lose consciousness. But all my tests were normal and my doctor was beginning to think I was faking it. Six months ago I switched general practitioners and this new one took my case seriously. I was seen by a cardiologist that week and was diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension. I was thrown on medication and I’m currently testing that out.
Onto the problem. I’ve been hearing my heartbeat in my ear for around a year now, I’d say a few months before I met my cardiologist. I have expressed this to him, but he hasn’t actually explained the cause or given me anything to relieve this symptom. The heartbeat is loud and almost hot feeling. I mostly feel it when I’m laying down at night time but recently it’s been all the time. For the last few months it was been so incredibly loud, and such a distraction for me. I already have adhd so concentration is a task as it is. I find I am constantly putting my fingers in my ear trying to get some relief. I also sometimes cannot hear people talking to me because of the heartbeat. It’s so loud that I can feel the pulse and it feels like my ear might explode. Some other things I’ve noticed alongside the heartbeat is I can also feel my pulse in my chest, like the saying “my heart is beating out of my chest” except I’m calm and in bed. I can also feel my neck pulsing as well. 
The medication I have been taking has been helping me with my symptoms. While I’m not 100%, I am functional. But this heartbeat has gotten worse. My doctors don’t want to talk to me so I’m asking the doctors of Reddit.

A few weeks ago, my husband woke up with right shoulder pain like he'd slept on it wrong. He'd also been having some bilateral elbow pain, worse on the left, for a couple of weeks before. Since then, the pain in his shoulder is escalating and his thumb and index finger are numb. The elbow pain has mostly subsided. I'll post a picture of what his shoulder blade looks like when he puts his hands together in the comments. Scary stuff! 

Like I said, he's 48m, Texas. We are 4 years out from HPV-caused throat cancer treatment that was diagnosed at stage II shortly after Covid hit. Port-a-cath near his right clavicle for 6 months (weekly cisplatin infusions, daily radiation), PEG tube for 3 months. Other than that, no surgical or major medical history. A few months ago, he started taking 50mg sertraline and 100mg quetiapine but this is his first foray into mental health treatment ever. He highly dislikes going to the doctors and dislikes meds even more. It was frankly a miracle that he agreed to the radiation and chemo. 

Not really knowing how to get the shoulder pain treated, I called a pain management clinic in the area on a Friday and begged them to see him. They squoze him in that day but after the $75 copay and a couple of quick range-of-motion tests on the exam table, the doc said that he doesn't really treat arms and shoulders but he has an orthopedic guy who does nothing but. He said my husband should alternate Advil and Tylenol until he talks to the ortho. Up until this point, we had been doing the NSAIDs, KT tape and almost nonstop consumer-grade TENS unit use. 

He had an appt with the hand/wrist/shoulder ortho the following week. I was not at that appointment but the doc did no imaging, just the quick r-o-m stuff. Doc said it could be a torn rotator cuff and tennis elbow but he wasn't sure and wants my husband to try physical therapy and give it 6 weeks to see if it improves. Prescribed a Medrol dose pack followed by Meloxicam. Neither have helped and the pain has steadily gotten worse. If you ask him where it hurts, he starts pointing at the back side of the shoulder. He says it is at its worst when he's trying to sleep - he can't get more than a few hours without it waking him up in excruciating  pain.  

A couple of days after the ortho, I got him in to see a chiropractor, another form of treatment he'd never tried before. He had his sixth appt tonight with them today. While they've cleared up some other issues, the shoulder is still killing him, steadily getting worse. I told him to call PT but he thinks they'll just give him some stretches and have him come back every other day. He doesn't want meds - he wants someone to Mr. Miyagi his shit so that he can sleep a full night again. He has been taking some Rick Simpson oil and it helps a little bit but this is Texas so it's hard to get and expensive. 

Again, picture of shoulder blade in comments. I don't think it's supposed to look like that but I am not a doctor. Does it look bad to anyone else? Thanks again for any guidance you can give us!!!",2024-11-13 04:49:09

Okay, so I've been struggling with some severely debilitating stomach issues lately. All my life I've had constipation, but 3 months ago is when it really started badly. 

I felt super nauseous, very bloated, had lots of trapped gas, very constipated, could barely eat. All things that normally help my constipation (a jog every day, lots of water) were no longer helping. That lasted a week or two, and then I had a few weeks of it being okay. Still constipated, but other symptoms were a little better. 

Now, I'm just confused. It got super bad maybe about a week ago, and all my symptoms started getting really bad again. Lots of painful trapped gas, bloating, burning stomach, general discomfort, loss of appetite. 

Anyway, yesterday or the day before, I can't exactly remember, I had 3-4 bowel movements, and they were soft, and that's a crazy amount for me. However, it was still super difficult for me to actually push them out even while they were soft.

For the first time in a while I felt like I'd almost emptied my bowels completely, which almost never happens for me, but today I have been suffering awfully. I feel so sick, as if I'm full of shit even though I went to the toilet so much yesterday. My stomach is burning, on and off, I just feel so nauseous and I'm emetophobic so it makes it so much worse. 

I've been to the doctors and they didn't really give me anything to help my symptoms, they did blood work and determined anemia, and I started taking ferrous sulfate a few days ago but stopped because it made me feel awfully ill. 

They're having me do a stool sample but I'm struggling to do that, but that's a whole other story. 

I just don't get what's happening to me. Why am I sometimes getting loads of bowel movements or and still feeling super constipated and ill, and where has this extra constipation come from? What can I do? I'm trying everything, drinking more water, taking lactulose, I just need some relief. I can't go on like this anymore. ",2024-11-13 04:44:32

I have been bodybuilding at a higher level for the past 2 years, preceded by about 10 years of regular weight training and cardio. In just this past year, I have been experiencing a change in the structure of my penis. I am circumcised, but the head of my penis retreats toward the inside of my body, such that a layer of skin comes over it and it LOOKS like I'm uncircumcised, but it's actually very uncomfortable. It happens more when I'm sitting, but can also happen when I'm standing. Periodically throughout the day I have to put my hand down my pants to push my penis head back out because it kind of hurts.

I did some research and there are some possibilities. I have taken PEDs in the past year, mostly primo (metenolone) and anavar (oxandrolone) in addition to high levels of testosterone. Now I am just on TRT levels of T (as of the past 3 months). The TRT is prescribed by a doctor, but the past primo and anavar use was not. Despite using an aromatase inhibitor when appropriate while on cycle, it's possible that estrogen has caused temporary penile atrophy, though my E2 levels are in healthy range these days (hx 3 months) so I am doubtful. I have also taken HCG (prescribed) throughout to stave off testicular atrophy. Sorry if the PED talk is too advanced or complicated. In a nutshell, it's possible that PED use caused high E2 despite my best efforts, and that high E2 caused this penis problem -- however, my E2 has been in physiologic normal range for months now so I am skeptical.

Another possibility is that because my body mass has gotten a lot bigger (170lbs to 220lbs within 1 year, most of it muscle), there is more subcutaneous fat pushing against the base of my penis, causing it to retract into a fat pad. Compounding this could be the size of my legs, which are a lot bigger than one year ago. However, I'm not clinically obese and my body fat percentage is not high (less than 15%), so I'm not sure.

There may be some issue with suspensory ligaments causing this too, especially where I do a lot of lower abdominal work (captains chair, weighted pull ups, etc) that tightens my lower abdomen, but I'm not versed enough in anatomy to consider this picture fully.

There are other more obscure possibilities... like high adrenaline levels related to working out (min 5 days a week, 90 mins per time) causing poor penile blood flow, but I'm not prepared to go down those rabbit holes when there may be a more basic explanation.

Yes I have consulted my GP in person about this. She said it doesn't qualify as ""buried penis,"" but she does see the problem I'm talking about (I showed her). She ruled out lymphedema and E2 with blood work, and essentially said that as long as I have normal libido and erectile function, it's not a lot to worry about. But I find the penile retraction really uncomfortable and sometimes the pulling sensation is actually painful (creates a pinching sensation). If I sit for a long time, like when I'm driving, my penis REALLY retracts, and can hurt.

Is there any medical professional in this group who has any idea what this could be? I feel like it's related to bodybuilding or hormones but I can't narrow it down. TIA!",2024-11-13 04:32:48

I ate a decent amount of what ended up being hydrogenated soybean oil on Saturday morning. I'm not sure how much - at the time I thought it was just a lot of low quality butter that they put on the soft pretzel at a new brewery. I emailed the owner and confirmed what it was after feeling sick for says. At most I'd say I consumed a tablespoon of this stuff. I only ate half the pretzel but it was DRIPPING in oil

I don't have much appetite and am eating very little, and I know I should be staying hydrated but no matter what I drink - water, Gatorade, juice, ginger ale - it makes me feel extremely nauseous. I'm on day 4 of watery diarrhea and the constant overwhelming feeling like I'm going to vomit.

Almost 2 years ago today (dec 22) i started coughing up yellow-green-white mucusy phlegm. It seems to have started after a visit to a hospital but I'm not 100% sure. I've never done any drugs or smoked or even layed hands on a vape so it's very strange to have started out of nowhere. I don't believe i have ever caught covid prior to thos either.

At first it was minor so i didn't think much of it up until it got noticeably worse in march. At that point I've tried my first antibiotic for it with no success. Thinking it was just a cold we thought it would just eventually clear up but it never did. In September of 2023 it got so bad that i was literally unable to sleep nearly all the time. I couldn't breathe properly and you'd hear my lungs making all sorts of strange noises and wheezing. It got so bad to the point i was hardly able to breathe. I would be coughing literally every 5 seconds 24/7 and my heart rate was reaching 200BPM after coughing and I'd feel lightheaded dizzy and like i was dying after every cough session which was every few seconds often lasting hours apon hours. I'm saying 6-8-10 hours of non-stop coughing until my lungs would be somewhat clear enough for me to stop coughing every 5 seconds. Literally buckets of mucus every day. However relief only really lasted a few minutes to a few hours at most before i had to go through the same thing again.

More then 95% of my life is just straight up coughing all day and night and i can hardly walk now before i run out of breath and feel like I'm dying, my heart rate has been elevated ever since it has started and every morning when i wake up i cannot breathe and spend hours coughing up buckets of mucus until my lungs are somewhat clear enough that I can get throughout the rest of my day, even though it never really ends and there is always mucus coming out all the day the worst part is usually in the morning because when i do finally sleep the mucus builds up in my lungs and since i am not constantly awake to cough every few seconds it fills up to the point where i can hardly breathe when i wake up and have to get it out.

Basically i was literally dying. At that point i was admitted to the hospital for months and had countless x rays & CT scans to the point where i was genuinely getting concerned about the side effects from the radiation. countless like absolutely countless to the point where i lost count Covid-19 tests & sputum tests which all came back negative.

At one point i even had a camera put down my lungs and they said that they were absolutely filled and they did remove some and they took some for even more testing but found nothing.

Unfortunately shortly after that i started coughing up a lot of pure blood. I'm guessing due to irritation. It stopped after a few days. I'm not too  sure why it happened but as i said maybe it was irritation from the Camara being put inside as my lungs where already irritated enough. I do already cough up blood from time to time but it's pretty rare and usually only a tiny bit mixed in with the mucus and not pure blood. I was given like 15 completely different types of antibiotics with absolutely no effect on the problem. The only antibiotic that seems to have worked is penicillin antibiotic, i coughed so much my throat was bleeding and it was too painful to swallow saliva, the penicillin seems to have worked as the next day i didn't notice any weird sounds from my lungs and i was honestly kinda shocked they sounded the clearest they've ever sounded since this BS suddenly started over a year ago (at that point) Unfortunately the penicillin caused a severe allergic reaction in my body and one of my hands literally inflamed like a balloon so i had to stop it & all the other antibiotics they gave me afterwards didn't work either just like all the previous ones. Symptoms came back less than 2 days after i stopped the penicillin. 

Although I'm not 100% sure it was working for me as i hardly got 2 doses it seems to have as literally nothing beforehand has even worked to slightly calm it down! Tried inhalers, oxygen and mist and humidifier treatments. I was put into different rooms during my stay at the hospital for more then 3 weeks at a time straight without any improvements so I'm not sure how likely it is to be an environment thing. I've tried acid reflux medications pantoprazole, tums etc as I've always had an issue with heartburn but it didn't help one bit in terms of the issue i was facing although it did with the heartburn. It's most certainly not acid reflux/ GERD as some doctors thought it might be. I've tried prednisone and was on it for over 6 months with a decent dose of 25mg. I had actually just recently stopped that a few days ago as it didn't help at all. 

I've literally tried everything. And to make my situation even more infuriating and sad is that I'm only 19 as of writing this. I've never ever smoked or done drugs or vaped or done anything of significance to harm my lungs in any way shape or form. I've never ever had breathing problems or asthma or any allergies in my life and never not even once in my life have i ever coughed up any sort of mucus beforehand. I didn't take any sort of new medication that can be causing this. Also during my stay at the hospital my oxygen levels where always 96+%. Basically i wasn't really struggling for oxygen and really the only thing i am struggling from is because the amount of mucus in my lungs being so much it's difficult for me to breathe or cough it up. That's the only problem i am facing really is the mucus and nothing else so I'm not sure how likely it is to be cancer. I do not know what's causing it and how to stop it as all of the previous attempts have been unsuccessful.

Only a few months ago back in may i saw a lung doctor that prescribed a new prednisone-based inhaler for me that significantly helped. I went from literally dying and severally depressed and suicidal 
to being able to enjoy my life again. But for the last month or so its been starting to get worse again. Maybe it's my fault for not regularly taking the inhaler but either way it means that so have to take this inhaler all my life and that this is not a permanent fix to this problem. I cannot even lay down during the day or I'll cough. When my lungs are finally clear enough to be able to lay down it feels like heaven and is amazing. You truly don't take anything for granted until it gets taken away from you. 

So yah that's how my life was suddenly ruined for no apparent reason and how it'll probably stay this way for the rest of it. I've yet to get a proper diagnosis answer from any doctor of the 20+ that I've seen for this issue, some are saying GERD (most certainly not) some say it's bronchitis and others literally tell me they don't have an explanation and that it's super strange to them. This on top of the severe IBD and arthritis and many other critical health issues i have all at this young age. My life is truly amazing. I've gone through a lot mentally too and i find people that want to take their life over mental issues or dumb minor life/family issues is very dumb. You'll never truly experience a true horrible life until your health is taken away & severely affected in a way that you cannot ever revert or heal from it then you'll really know what the meaning of a ""terrible life"" really is. Every day i cry after hours of suffering and wonder if it'll ever go away and realize how my life was literally trashed in a matter of seconds out of nowhere for no reason.

Update 11/11/2024: i am posting to r/AskDocs because my situation is getting worse again. It has never stopped as I've previously mentioned but it's getting to the point where yesterday i was up all night coughing and crying. I was literally hardly awake but forced not to go to sleep because of the coughing. So much mucus it just never ends. The inhalers that my doctor gave me are hardly working. I cannot take this anymore I've tried everything and i really mean it. I might go to the hospital again but honestly I'm tired of it because they haven't been able to help me in this regards even after 6 months in the hospital and like 30 x-rays 10 CT scans 15 completely different antibiotics with absolutely no effect. Prednisone also doesn't affect it in any way. Anti fungal medications. Absolutely nothing is working. I cannot live like this anymore that's why i am posting to here. My life is now 99% of it just coughing up mucus 24/7 u genuinely cannot take this anymore nobody feels me. My lungs are making all sorts of noises. I don't know how the doctors even sent me home in this condition. It is quite serious but they don't seem to be understanding or maybe it's because they've tried everything and nothing has worked that they don't know what else to do. I think the next thing to do is to get a biopsy. What do you guys think I should do because I'm cant anymore i can't even type properly as I'm writing this o am just so cooked by all this i am absolutely done. Every time i cough my heart rate goes 140+ bpm at one point even reached 188. Im slowly dying from it. This is serious condition and i can't just sit here and let it kill me alive. I'm literally coughing as I'm writing this IT JUST NEVER STOPS AND O HONESTLY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER GO AWAY I NEVER SMOKED OR VAPED OR DID DRUGS IT JUST STARTED OUT OF NOWHERE I WANT TO PULL MY HAIR OUT",2024-11-12 01:51:26

Recently I made a post as I thought my doctor was giving up on my bad neck/shoulder pain ([post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fx6c0n/is_my_doctor_giving_up_where_can_i_go_from_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), but I have a follow-up question given recent updates. I am a 27M who has neck and shoulder issues. No smoking or super bad habits aside from junk food.

I spoke to the nurse practitioner in the office, which I didn't know was available. I was using her as a last resort before asking for an MRI requisition to go to the USA. She seemed to take a lot more care and tried to get a deep understanding of my ongoing neck issue. I gave a lot of details about everything and she said she doesn't think that an MRI is worth it because it wouldn't show any muscle tension. Whether or not I agree isn't my question, however. She did agree with me that my issue shouldn't persist for over two years as a 27-year-old and I shouldn't be living like this even if my doctor said that there's nothing to do.

She said she thinks it might be best to go with a route of taking muscle relaxants before bed and seeing if that helps, as I mentioned a lot of my pain happens in the morning. But then she did some basic neurological tests on me, took some other small tests, and said that she was going to meet with my doctor about getting me an MRI even after she said it likely wasn't worth it.

My main concern though is that I was very quick to get email confirmation that the MRI request was sent to my local hospital for an MRI scan of my spine and brain, and within two hours of the request I got an appointment. I was expecting the MRI to be in April or May given it isn't urgent (or December at the earliest), and I just have neck and shoulder pain. I tried to chill out and just consider myself lucky, but I ran into someone I knew who recently had a tentative MRI appointment with the same hospital for a pretty bad lower-body injury and the hospital's earliest appointment for them was 11 months away. I am now convinced I have a brain tumour or something, even though I assume they had a spot to fill from a cancellation and I was lucky to get it.

For a neck and shoulder issue, I assume the MRI scan on the brain is more of a way to get imaging of the head and the connective tissues. But is it weird or concerning that the appointment they gave was 13 days later? This hospital is in Ontario, Canada and has an average wait time of over two months for MRI imaging, and I have only heard that I should be expecting to wait months to get into an MRI.

Any input to calm myself down is appreciated.",2024-11-13 04:13:32

In 2018 until about a year ago I was struggling with projectile vomiting/stomach pain episodes. So bad it would land me in the ER as I could not cope with the pain whatsoever. It seemed like no matter what I ate I had episodes 1-2x a month where my body just couldn't digest my food and then an episode would happen. They did a bunch of testing and couldn't find much besides delayed gastric emptying. Over the past year I have not had an episode thankfully but then they caught intussusception on an unrelated scan. They're thinking they got lucky catching it and it may have been the culprit all along.

My questions are, because of my past issues (even if my episodes are dormant right now) is surgery likely necessary?

Also, I was planning a pregnancy for next year, if they decide to not pursue surgery would pregnancy be safe or could it cause a flare up/blockage?

I know no one can give me a definitive answer without an actual test, but I’m not sure what else I could have. 

My symptoms:

- weight loss and no appetite. I went from 107 pounds to 95 pounds within two months. I haven’t been this underweight in quite a few years (I’m 5ft 6in). I just can’t eat. 

- night sweats. This happens most nights and it isn’t like I just got too warm under the blanket. My pajamas will be sticking to me once I wake up and a wet spot is on the sheets. I’ve woken up to the feeling of sweat rolling down my neck. And I won’t be hot, I wake up shivering because it feels like I’ve been dunked in water then put under a fan. 

- super tired and weak. I sleep 12-14 hours a night. And I’ll still be tired and weak throughout the day. It feels like I’ve lost muscle. Everything is heavy and it feels like my limbs are full of cement. Even my head will be too heavy for my neck and I constantly have to rest it on something. 

- cough and low fever only at night. During the day I won’t have a cough. Then at night I’ll get the feeling of something sticky and wet in my lungs and no matter how hard I try I cannot cough it out or make it go away. It isn’t a wet or productive cough. A lot of bright green and super thick mucus constantly in my throat

But I don’t think I’m immunocompromised or anything so I’m not sure how I would’ve gotten it? It’s been going on for a while and only getting worse. 

Could I actually have tuberculosis like a frail Victorian child walking the Oregon trail?? ",2024-11-13 03:43:17

I have a lump on my abdomen near my ribs that is pretty soft and easily movable. I got it tested with a ultrasound and they gave me the results,and my doctor called me also saying it looks like it's just a lipoma but if anything changes to call. What scares me is that he only said it looks like a lipoma and not that it is a lipoma. And that the doc who did the ultrasound says clinical follow up reccomended on the report but I have not followed up since the ultrasound. I got the ultrasound back in April of this year and have been stressing about it ever since because I am so afraid of cancer being my mother died of cervical cancer and it was horrible. The possible lipoma does hurt only sometimes kind of like throbbing pain or sharp pain but quickly goes away and I don't know if this is normal for a lipoma. I can't even go to another doctor right now for a 2nd opinion like I would like to because I have no health insurance so I was just looking for some opinions.. Here is what the doctor that reviewed the ultrasound put on the report;

It started with severe intermittent upper right quadrant pain that radiated up my shoulder, with belching, and loose yellow stools. 
The ER ruled out gallbladder issues with an ultrasound and a CT scan. Everything looked perfect on my CT and ultrasound. 

Did an endoscopy last week, still awaiting biopsy results but the doctor did mention a possibility of gastritis. The pain had significantly lessened at this point. 

Fast forward to this past weekend, i had several drinks which is the first time I’ve drank in about a month. Woke up this morning with Black stools, and some with red chunks in them, or orangish-reddish stool with black spots. The pain is back but not as intense. 
I go back to the ER, they draw my blood, do another CT, which didn’t show any internal bleeding. 
They discharged me but now that I am home I am feverish and nauseas. 

I don’t know what to do, and the anxiety of something being wrong and no one catching it is completely debilitating.

Weight: 79kg (174ibs)
Gender: Male
Smoking status: previous weed, cigarette and vaping for a 5 year period however quit for over a month now
Previous medical issues: Childhood obesity, diagnosed with childhood asthma (can be linked to my current issues)
Current medical issues: allergic rhinitis, acute/chronic sinusitis, calcification in nostril and sinus, moderate sleep apnea, severe when supine, moderate paranasal sinus inflammation, grade 3 bilateral tonsils, keros type 3 and possibly more once I see my ENT
Duration and location: Nasal airways, sinuses, throat airflow system for >13 years which has only progressively got worse. 
Current medication: dymista 120 two sprays per nostril twice a day, saline sinus flush 3 times a day

The first time I saw an ENT was about 5 years ago, they only did a nasal endoscopy on me and diagnosed me with a deviated septum. They gave me dymista and told me to come back in 6 months and tell them if it helped (which it did for my right nostril)  and said we could do deviated septum surgery if it didn’t help. I didn’t want to go through public health (free healthcare where I live) for a surgery like that and didn’t have money for private surgery as I was only ge 18 at the time. I also was told by a specialist that mouth breathing is normal so I never thought this was an issue. Recently I had noticed sleep apnea symptoms and scored 16AHI and told my gp I wanted to fix my “deviated septum” so I got a CT scan done and a private ENT booked. When I got my results from my CT scan it shows my septum is in the midline however there are a bunch of other issues occurring in my sinuses acute/chronic sinusitis among other things. This has caused calcification in one nostril and extreme inflammation on that side with 0 airflow in that nostril. My nose visually looks extremely lopsided because of this, could this have been the reason it was called a deviated septum due to no CT scan being done. Growing up I had constant infections in the ear, nose and throat locations such as tonsillitis and middle ear infections (which I knew I had because I had them back to back at the age of 5) but was denied the opportunity to see the doctor for these due to neglect from my guardian who did not believe me and wouldn’t take me to the doctor. When I hit a certain age my guardian would never believe I was sick and would just tell me to go to school eventually I would stop asking and just cope with the pain. My GP was aware of my large tonsils but unaware that I was constantly getting tonsillitis (he wasn’t my gp when I had it at 5) and told my guardian to monitor my snoring (which didn’t happen). The doctors were under the impression that my lung function and allergic rhinitis was causing asthma (however it didn’t help that I was fat and unfit at the time) but never did x-ray on my chest because I was doing spirometry tests, they were not aware of constant infections occurring in my ears and throat (and from what my gp said yesterday I have concurrent infections in my sinus) I currently am in great physical shape, about 12% body fat with decent amount of muscle and do mma training competitively, I have not had wheezing, shortness of breath and chest pain for many years since I lost weight (as a child I was obese) however my respiratory function is poor due to airflow issues in my throat and nose which was also shown on my sleep study. I was told that mouth breathing is common in children and eventually corrects itself which is why the specialists focused primarily on lung function giving me Symbicort to open my airways and only sent me to the ENT at the age of 18.

Hi everyone, 
 
I had an emergency c section 12 months ago and slept for the first three days of my baby’s life. It was an uncontrollable sleepiness. Anyway, a year has passed and I’ve just stopped breast feeding. Since then, I’ve begun smelling things often, sometimes daily that aren’t there: smoke, my dogs shampoo, fish/salty smells, I have begun seeing large grey globs in my line of sight. Today,  it happened twice. I also have the sensation of my skin being wet or touched sometimes. 

About a month ago, I started having some nasal dripping after an intense gym session. It would drip upon standing, bending, lifting. My PCP ordered a CT with and without dye but no abnormalities were found that suggested a CSF leak. 

I grew up (30f) with chronic migraines, received Botox from my neurologist office after many many medication regimens failed. The Botox gave me relief but when I started IVF and TTC in 2019 I stopped and since moved out of state and never got back to a neurologist office. My migraines were surprisingly low during pregnancy and breast feeding, and now pretty cyclical. This past year I’ve also been diagnosed with sleep apnea and have a CPAP. I have been trying to get back with a neurologist office. I’m worried I could have a brain tumor with the sense of smell things and now seeing things. 

I am in Richmond, VA and reached out to our local University hospital but they aren’t taking any new patients. I’m worried about the possibility of a neurological problem while having a young child. ",2024-11-13 03:23:20

So my guess is the eardrum ruptured and filled my middle ear with water? I then had this relentless feeling of water in my ear for at least 10 hours, then somehow it went away without me noticing any leakage. I have no idea where it could have went but regardless, I should have it examined for bacterial infection right?

Well all the local ENT's are in the same hospital, and the hospital won't let me see them until I get a hearing test which isn't available until February. So wtf am I supposed to do until then? If I search in other nearby cities will they also refuse to see me without a hearing test? Are there any good telehealth apps that let me pay without health insurance, and will let me see a remote ENT where they can at least listen to my situation and advise me on what to look out for or how much of an emergency this is? The only advice google could offer was to see a doctor ASAP and that getting water in the middle ear is a huge problem. If you can please lmk of any good telehealth apps or tell me whether I'm overreacting or not reacting enough.

It's been a day since the water ""went away"" and I feel normal but am obviously concerned about an infection.

I know what constipation pain feels like and this hurts so much worse. The thing that worries me the most is that I have a slightly higher pain tolerance. Now I’m not saying it’s super high but an example is when I was a bit younger I broke my ankle and my friends mother, who was a nurse, told me I wasn’t in enough pain for it to be broken so I went two days walking with a broken ankle.

As the years past, i never really checked my BP at home but doctor visits never said anything, (moved states so didn’t have a primary for a bit) 

This past pregnancy, i was considered high risk. Put on Nifedipine 30, then 60mg in 3rd try. My blood pressure was always 130/80 or higher (reaching up to 150’s medicated). 1 week postpartum it shot up to the 180/100 WITH my medicine. Postpartum preeclampsia diagnosis, 8 hour mag drip, labatol IV push & monitored overnight, sent home with same meds. 

My blood pressure still sits around 130/80 sometimes a bit lower but never in the ideal ranges. 
Just got a new primary doctor, and he is keeping me on the meds for a few months to see if my bp goes down. But is it likely? I would hate to be on medication for life. I’ve been choosing no sodium options, and not adding salt to meals.

It started as a sore throat and got worse with a cough, nasal congestion, headaches, fatigue, ear infection and eye infection. The first doctor told me I had a sinus infection and prescribed me cefdinir for 5 days. This cleared up my ear mostly and I started feeling better. Eye drops cleared my eye up within a few days. 

However, I ran out of cefdinir and still has a really painful sore throat and dry cough. I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen and still couldn’t sleep well because of how much my throat hurt and the coughing fits that would wake me up. I went to a different doctor, she put me on 20mg of prednisone for 5 days and told me to take Sudafed and Tylenol around the clock and Flonase at night. I finished the prednisone on Friday and finally slept through the night for the first time in weeks Saturday night. I’ve kept up with Sudafed and Flonase at night.

My only symptom at that point was a dry cough sporadically throughout the day which would be worse at night and in the morning.

Today, Tuesday, this afternoon all at once, my throat started hurting again. I’ve taken Tylenol and it hasn’t helped. The second doctor told me she could see white drainage at the back of my throat. I looked at my throat today and I still see white drainage at the back of my throat.

Yall. I’m at a complete loss. I don’t know what else to do. I was taking theraflu every night at first, salt water gargling, Mucinex but haven’t done any of that in a week. Should I try another antibiotic? I have doxycycline in my cabinet that I got for acne purposes.

I'm only a couple of weeks out, so while the cough is clone and I can breathe deeply again- as expected I'm still fatigued and get out of breath after a pretty simple walk (I'm normally a 5 times a week at the gym person, and have been in the best health and fitness of my life this past 12 months, so this is depressing the hell out of me, but I digress) 

But let's say in 6 weeks, I'm feeling fine, even if not my pre-pneumonia gym level of fitness... what exactly are they looking for on these X-rays, and if they see something despite me feeling fine, is there more that needs to be done? (if it's obvious, I'm definitely not seeing it!) My brain is sitting on the high doses of antibiotics I ended up on, and thinking surely if I'm feeling fine I wouldn't have to keep taking something like that?

(Unsure if relevant, but I tested negative to all of the viral and bacterial tests they ran, so there was no clues about what brought about the pneumonia, though they have marked it as ""community acquired"". 

I have a history of several spontaneous pneumothorax, that again no cause was ever identified, but it has been a solid 20 years since I was last hospitalised with that.

I would normally go to the doctor but im in the middle of switching from my moms insurance to my husbands and the new one doesn’t start till January so im scared to go and it be super expensive especially if it’s nothing.

Memory loss i realize i keep forgetting little things, like i forget which door is locked at work and keep trying to go through the locked one. Forgetting to bring my dogs favorite toy with us when we go to work and he throws a fit all day long.

The main one was there’s a dog, george, that i do not associate with at all cuz he attacked me pretty badly a while ago and now im very scared of him, well he came in the other day and i went up and got him and one of my coworkers were like “omg lauren what are you doing with george” and i was like omg silly this isn’t george, this dog is brown and george is grey. and they were like no that’s literally george and had to prove it to me. honestly still can’t wrap my head around it.

History: I have felt chest pain like this before, but it was more mild and less consistent. Often occurs after not getting enough sleep, or while in a bad POTS flare 

Symptoms (since this morning): 

1) Dull ache/pressure directly behind sternum, occasionally with sharp pains. Pain is more or less consistent, changes little if any regardless of position, applied pressure, or rest/activity; although may be slightly worse when moving. I have not dared to do any activity more strenuous than walking or going up stairs

2) Nausea (which is common for me) and vomiting (very rare for me)

3) Lightheadness/dizziness, however I was already having issues with both, though not quite to this degree. General sense of weakness

Please help,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gq27yy/eye_changed_shape_in_a_matter_of_months_please/,1,"I'm going to try to keep this short but I want to make sure I describe everything. Sorry if it gets long! For context, 27 years old, always had 20/15 - 20/20 vision, no known family history of eye problems, both parents only in the last 5 years got glasses for reading.

Yesterday I was walking my dog at the park and something got into my left eye. As I was rubbing it / trying to get whatever was in there out, I noticed that my right eye was blurry. It was blurry enough to where I could not read the text messages on my phone screen when my left eye was closed. I thought it was very weird, especially given that the only reason I noticed was because I so happened to close my left eye due to a random event. What I noticed tho, is that if I squinted very hard then and only then did text become clear / normalish again. I had just got my 2 year eye checkup in June 5 months ago, and both eyes were between 20/15 - 20/20. Either way, I've had very good vision my entire life (Turning 27 soon).

Anyways, thought it was weird but didn't think too much about it as when both eyes are open everything seems normal, I thought i'd wake up and it would be back to normal. Woke up today, and it was the same. During work I called my optometrist and got in at the end of the work day. What she found was that in the 5 months since seeing her, my eye had changed shape enough to be causing this. She found no structural damages or abnormalities such as inflammation , scratches, etc. She then took some more advanced photos of my one eye, and referred me to a ophthalmologist .

I am absolutely freaking out that I somehow permanently damaged my eye. The one thing that I do have, is a nervous tic that I've never went to a doctor for about, but one thing it makes me do is turn my eyes to one side and sometimes press on my eye until the feeling goes away. This doesn't last long at all but does happen multiple times a day. These tics can change year to year on how exactly im expressing them, but its been the eyes for a while, far longer than when I saw her last in June, even then I had been doing them for a while. I want to be clear tho, I am not pressing or rubbing it very hard at all.

I just don't understand how this happened in such a short time frame (5 months), even the optometrist said it was unusual and was kind of confused. Walking out of that appointment and into tonight i've never had this bad health anxiety before, I can't stop thinking about how my eye will never be the same and that I am the reason it happened and that it could have been prevented. I obviously don't know for sure what the outlook is or what caused it until I see the ophthalmologist  but I can't get over the feeling I did this with my tics.

The reason I want to post this is because the optometrist said that because it's not an emergency and that there is no ""damage"" or pain or discharge, I probably won't get in to the  ophthalmologist  for a while. I'd really like to hear anyone's opinion on this as I'm left to my own thoughts until I can get into that specialist, and I doubt I will sleep tonight. Is there any hope of this going back to normal or am I truly screwed?

I have obviously made myself cough a few times to check if it was coming from my chest or a cut in my mouth or something. It’s not from a mouth wound. My throat doesn’t really hurt or feel dry. 

My doctor has availability in 3 days, and since I feel fine otherwise I’m tempted to wait for that appointment unless there’s any other reason this could be a medical emergency. The internet seems really split on whether or not to go to the ER. I’m trying to not freak out. Any input would be helpful! ",2024-11-13 02:11:27

So, I unfortunately forgot the holiday on Monday and missed the pharmacy before going away. I am going to run out of bisoprolol I take for tachycardia/hbp.
The more troubling of the two is the heart rate for me, I missed a dose once since being on it and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. My wife takes metropolol to lower heart rate after having a heart attack years ago. Can I temporarily take metropolol to control the heart rate for a day or two until getting home? I realize medication is not meant to be shared, not to take someone's meds etc. I wouldn't even consider it except for the extremely uncomfortable feeling when my heart races and beats heavy now..",2024-11-12 20:09:00

I didn’t put too much thought into it because I’ve always written off so many things to my anxiety disorder. This was until about two weeks I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and when I got out of bed I felt an intense head-rush sensation. I began to walk down the hall to the bathroom and the next thing I knew I passed out. My memory of this is kinda blurred but I came too quickly and remember trying to continue to the bathroom. When I got into the bathroom and shut the door I passed out again, this time I came to completely on my back on the floor looking up at the ceiling. In hindsight, I realized I should have gone to the hospital. However, I went to urgent care the next day and when I went I had another episode of this feeling while trying to check in. It felt impossible to form a sentence when trying to tell the front desk why I came in. I was told that it was more than likely an inner ear infection and was given steroids and an anti-vertigo medication. Fast forward to now and I’m still getting episodes of this headrush/vertigo feeling. I’ve also noticed a lot more ringing sensation in my ears, sometimes it’s more of a sound going in and out almost muffled then clear. A sensation of brain fog is pretty consistent and my memory has not been good at all. However I have begun to also get fairly intense headaches, I’ve had migraines before and this doesn’t feel the same. I don’t feel like I can’t look at any lights but I hear a fairly persistent high-pitched sound and my head is almost throbbing.

Background: Self-diagnosed hypochondriac but actually diagnosed ADHD - around 3 years ago. 🙃 No allergies - taking Elvanse and short-acting lisdex + multivitamins. Almost finished medical school but Im not a very good med student. 

PMH: born premature - low birth weight 2.5kg? And apparently mum was ill after birth but unsure why. eczema in childhood, surgery - multiple tooth extractions bc cavities, BMI in obese/overweight category my entire life. Currently weigh around 67kg and I am 5”1. 

FHx: T2DM, asthma, eczema. 

//

So I have a lot of random things and I’m not sure how to explain them in an easy to format way but I shall go with the flow…


1) Hypermobility (shoulders) Started with left shoulder when I was 11 years old. Noticed I could move the arm bone in and out of the socket - no pain. Then a couple of years later I suddenly couldn’t move it for 1-2 days and there was sudden sharp pain. This resolved but prompted me to see GP, did xray, nothing abormal on the bone - low/weak muscle i think. Did physio, helped kinda. Never did again tho. Currently: both right and left shoulder affected, left is worse. And left scapula sticks out/ is more unstable im sure. 

2) Hips - so I had a leriod of time when I was 17 when I really inactive for 2 months - family holiday and there was nothing to do but sit. Came back and my hip would ‘give way’ as i was walking. This got better the more I walked and now only my left hip will only ?dislocate if I want it to. 

Also around one/both hips anteriorly, there has always been what looks like swelling around the joint (ithinkk) Not painful in itself. And notice some pressure when I try to extend my hip join too much - i think probs from sitting too much. 

When i rotate my leg at my hips, i can feel crunching/clicking at both hip joints.no pain tho. 

3) Mucus / hoarse throat. I have noticed this issue since I was maybe 13/14. It was the feeling of mucus stuck in my throat and that I have to clear it. And mt friend would always tell me to clear my throat. Doctor said to drink my water, it helps, but doesnt fix it. Still have fhe same issue now. It genuinely stops me from speaking to people. Sometimes I dont know if I will be able to get the words out, or the words wouldnt come out. I can only comfortable whispher. or I feel like trying to talk really loudly is okay maybe but talking at a normal volume is where the issue is. 

Unsure if normal, but sometimes if i think about swallowing I cant, or its difficult, eventually manage it but theres a difficulty.


I have been taking antacids tablets and the first time i had it was like woah. I could sing a song at a volume I want without my voice breaking up. But that only reslly happened fhe first time, had probably 10 more tablets and not really noticed any different but I also am recovering from a URTI. 

Also, my speech isnt very clear to others at times and I can tell when it isnt. But i am able to make it clear but it takes a lot of mental effort to make sure Im talking a certain way. 

4) Recent infections. So around 3 months ago I lost my voice - for the first time ever. I was able to whisper okay but not for too long. Then once that started getting better, I got a R-sided chest infection.

Now I am recovering from URTI. 

But generally throughout the whole year I feel like theres always something ill sounding with me. And that me and my (nurtient deficient) brother are always the ones to become ill if theres a resp illness in the house. 

Maybe it’s hayfever but its more coryzl sx. And does hayfever or allrefkes present the same wsy bc this reacts didferent to my other allergy symptosmz 


5) Speech and langauge. I have ALWAYS struggled with reading snd writing. Since reception, I remember thinking I have no idea whats going on. But depsite that I was still in top set throughout my whole school. 

When reading a book together as a class = lost. 

When I had to write anything, i was litersly lost for words. Incould find the words snd how to stringn them together. I would literslly spend a whole lesson and have knly written 1 sentence when werre expected to write a page or two. Or the whole page will end up being scribbled out and bc inwas a good kid, i think they tjought jt was me being perfectionist but i just couldnt do it. 

Somehow managed to do well in writing exams and got A/A* but idk how. I also find that when I’m angry, I am surprisingly articulate 😂 but tjis doesnt happen often. But yeah always struggled to articulate speech and explain things, i think in my head i think im talking too slow and when J see other people’s blank face, i feel like im boring them and paanic and dk what to say.

I feel like i tend tk get simialr soundign words mixed up. 

I feel my ability to articulate my speech has gone worse with time. But im not sure jf this is because the effect js more noticable in my adult life now? Also infeel more brain fog-y since adulting and starting uni but in a different way to adhd brain fog, i cant explain

 6) Back lump/pain. So lets say around 5 years ago, inwould get back pain in mid to lower back (mainly mid) - dull achey pain - before my period was due to start. It wasnt ‘painful’ in the normal sense just very uncomfortable to lie down and sleep, in any position. 

Since then, I feel like this increased with frequency and more dull/acheyness for a couple years. I also notcied at the time, that on top my vertebrae there is a lump there. Its smooth, non-tender, not really palpable when laying down but its visible and very easily palpable when i sit up. Cant tell if the lump moves with the skin over it or stays there. Its got a defined-ish border, and its not too hard/soft

Indont think the pain bothers me as much as kt did once but yeah its still there. And lump is same size as ai rmemeber it being. Maybe 2cm circumference??

I did see a chiropractor once for an asessmenrt and asked about the lump fhis and she didnt seem worried. Said that if the muscles around the spine are tight and gathered toggeher there?? 

7) Scoliosis? My back always feels off - not comfortable. I do have the habit of cracking my back. If i look at the creases on my abdomen, they are unsymmetrical. I feel like my spine looks off when I bend down. 

And now remember my shoulder snd hip? They aslo feel out of alignement. So lets say my height is the Y axis, and my width is the X, Z axis is perpendicular to me. It feels as though Each of my shoulders and hips feel like its in the opposite halves of ghe Z-axis. Like lne hip feels more forward.

Did discuss this with chiropractor…

8) Constipation and bleeding. I have always been more on the constipated side. And obvs it’s worse when I dont exercise or drink enough water. I have noticed bright red blood in my stool since I was a teen, idk how old maybe 12. But didnt think it was ahytbing concerning tbh as i knew i was constipated. 

I think over the last 6 months tho, i feel like i have noticed more blood at times. I think it started with having 2 faecal impactions and luckily we have disposable gloves in the bathroom bc I had to manually which i had to manually evacuate... This happened a couple times in the past too. 


9) FACE and Mouth:

everyones face js assymetrical but I think mine is worse ? I saw an orthodontist who said my terth are in the kidlinr so its my lips that are to one side but its not even like that. Its like a mixture strong on one side vs the other. And my eyes and eybrows are assymetrical. 

It looks like i ahve excess skin on my eyelid, one side is slight ptosis, but theyre probs slightly ptsosis? I had a look at ohotos and the assymetry has been there since a child. Not sure anout the eye ptosiss stuff tjo. 

My tonsils are assymetric. Left is more bumpy and has crypts. Right is smaller and has craters. My unvula points towards the right - i dont think this was there before med school bc I remember checking if uvula was symmetric when we learn the cranial nerve exams . 

10) Mood and ovulation. My period is regualr and I’m able to ntoice when Im ovulating bc there will always be a time in the month were i feel veyr depressed and low and once the irrational thoughts kick in, i check when my leriod is due, and it turns out it’s literslly the day my app says im ovulating at. These bad moments in the month reallt make it dficult tto stick to anything good and sets me back so mcuch everytime

- are your neck lymph nodes always meant to be palpable? Bilateral soft lymph nodes, moveable. Currently 1cm+ but i think thuebhave been like this for a couple months atleast (im very bad wjfh timings)
- My heart rate has always been very low - even as a very overwight/unfit child - like 55-60. 
- 5 years ago: blood test: low iron, very low vitamind d,  TFT normal. 
- i can clikc the bottom of my ribs in and out. 
- I have a single thick verrry loong hairs randomly across my body (one on each shoulder, back, face)
- I feel like tm hair in generslly is very thick and coarse and more sparse than normal. 
- i procrastinate bedtime so much until its too late. I ahve probably gotten less than 20 hours of sleep in a whole week for the past couple months. And theres times when I go days without sleeping for 1/2 dyas and feel fine. Average sleeping 2 hours. In fact i feel more energised than when i do sleep. I worked nightshift for a long time and think that finally messed up circadiun rhythhm. I think i get mkre enegrised st night. And dont even nap. I am able to fall asleep tho jf j try but idk i cant get myself to try. I have been trying tk fix my sleep since I was like 10 probbaly bc kts always been pretty Awful. Just esp worse now. 

P.S I know this is a lot of writing. So sorry. Also I feel embarrassed having to read this post again so please try and overlook the typos 🙏

I think im driving myself crazy bc I genuinely don’t know is paranoia vs what js actually concerning and I should probs get checked out. 

If im being honest, its the not knowing that is worse for me - rather than the idea of having something that is worringing (which isn’t rationale but yeah its the truth).

Also even tjough i think I’m quite a hard nut to crack/offend but I will probably cry if someone says anything mean 😂😭😭",2024-11-13 02:02:15

About two months ago, I found a rubbery lump in my thigh, about 1.5 inches above my knee. It feels rubbery and bouncy to the touch, not very hard. It’s sort of a flat lump, if that makes sense; not like a ball or anything. It feels like it’s just below the surface of my skin, and is probably just under two inches in diameter. It hasn’t been tender to the touch, and I’m not experiencing pain, swelling, numbness, weakness or limited range of motion in the affected leg/knee. When I felt it for the first time two months ago, I wasn’t concerned, because I thought it was a temporary muscle knot. About a week ago, I felt it again and was alarmed that it was still there. I don’t think it’s changed in size. But, today I feel like it has shifted upward about half an inch. I made an appointment with my PCP, but it’s a few days away. I’ve done some digging online, and the only thing I can think of is a lipoma. But then, I went down the liposarcoma rabbit hole and I’m terrified, since that’s malignant. I have such bad health anxiety and I’ve almost convinced myself it’s a liposarcoma. ",2024-11-13 01:59:28
AskDocs,1gpobge,Over the past eight months my left breast has been enlarging  ,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpobge/over_the_past_eight_months_my_left_breast_has/,2,"As pretty much indicated in the title, my left breast has been slowly growing in size. I no longer fit into any of my bras because it is now at least a full cup size larger than my right breast! Over the past 8 months I have undergone 2 mammograms and an ultrasound which have all resulted in negative findings. 

I (67f) have an extensive medical history which includes 16 abdominal surgeries, an array of medications (none of which are new), and a number of diagnoses. The bigger issues are Fibromyalgia, Peptic Ulcer, hEDS, Diabetes type 2 (diet controlled), Migraines, and Chronic Pain associated with my abdominal surgeries.  My surgeries include Bilroth II, Cholecystectomy, Sigmoid Colectomy, Total Hysterectomy, and numerous cysts and fibroids. The hysterectomy was over 30 years ago and after HRT was blamed for a Pulmonary Embolism I was removed from HRT. 

I need to stress that my left breast is not red, hot to the touch, discoloured, leaking or overly painful. There is a small lump approximately one centimetre on the outer left side which I have been told is nothing to be concerned about. I honestly cannot remember what the doctor who performed the ultrasound called it. Perhaps a blood vessel? Which reminds me that I forgot to mention Carotid Artery Disease which was diagnosed to explain the lump in my neck.

I realize that I have a very wide range of health issues and so far I would like to think that I have a decent handle on everything. My PCP of 30+ years retired almost two years ago, therefore, I am now relying on the physicians at my local clinic who, although they are excellent, are only able to provide care on a limited time basis. They have little time to delve into my medical history which causes me to worry that they can easily miss a connection which could explain this! ",2024-11-12 16:12:59

TSH: <0.01 mIu/L

Free T3: 27.9 pmol/L

I am seeing the specialist tomorrow morning and the GP checked my heart rate and blood pressure. She told me this can easily be remedied with meds and monitoring. 

My TSH is usually on the lower end but never abnormal, I also have a 2mm nodule on the left of my thyroid. My most recent tests were March this year, I am surprised this has happened so suddenly. I think my mum has some thyroid issues and high blood pressure.  I got the antibody tests done today whilst at the GP clinic. 

My main symptoms are anxiety, faster heart rate (nothing extremely high), trembling, muscle pain, nausea and fatigue. I am scared of thyroid storm as I have been seeing this online. 

I would just like an opinion, I never thought this would be the cause for so many symptoms I thought were just anxiety.

Need expert opinion please,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gppju9/pregnant_and_extremely_depressed_need_expert/,2,"Female 28, height 5”4, weight 92 kg. Smoker: no. Drinker: no. Medical history: previously on antidepressants, diagnosed anxiety disorder & depression few years ago. Currently on online private talking therapy with a therapist. 8 weeks pregnant. Previous miscarriage at 6 weeks in June 2024. No other pregnancies.

I’m in my first trimester and having really bad depression.  Previously I used to be on antidepressants from 2020-2024 before I stopped taking them this year as I was planning my first pregnancy. I’ve always struggled with rumination and anxiety as well, which seems to have gotten worse now. I’m finding it difficult to cope and my private therapist suggested to speak to the GP (I’m in the UK)  to get me quickly assessed or on some medication to help me get by, with a small dose. 

Now the issue is, I weaned off of antidepressants out of choice and thought I’d manage my moods through therapy, exercise etc. This was working somewhat before I conceived but recently, likely due to hormonal changes too, I’m struggling to compose myself and it’s jeopardizing every aspect of my life from professional to personal. Therapy seems to be very slow and I’m losing my mind in between. I know if I speak to the GP, they would put me back on a low dose of antidepressants (Citalopram) that I was taking before, and my therapist suggests this too. And I understand that it’s safe to take during pregnancy. But it took a lot of struggle to wean off them and be free of meds and I don’t want to go back to taking them everyday and feel abnormal. Surely there should be some permanent one-time fix that fixes this. I feel so helpless. I don’t want to take antidepressants again.

Other than antidepressants, is there any other treatments I can do after delivering the baby like electrotherapy or something physical that helps my brain? Not sure if this even makes sense. I want to somehow physically rewire my brain. Even the meds felt like they weren’t working for me anymore when I stopped taking them early this year. There seems to be no way out. I’m looking for professional advice from a psychologist or expert as the NHS GP in the UK literally just put you on antidepressants after listening to 2 sentences out of you and have the “thank u,next” attitude.

This time it's really hurting. And white pus comes out of it. And it's literally a lump, I can feel it when I walk. And it hurts to sit on it. And if my pee touches it, it stings really bad. The other day I sat for a prolonged amount of time and it made my entire left labia minora feel raw and tender. Did I cut it shaving and it became infected? I don't know what to do and I'm scared. Does this look like herpes? It's an oval shaped lump. What could this possibly be?

P.s I took a look at my razor the day I noticed the lump and it had some rust on it.",2024-11-13 01:43:51

When standing, or even sitting leaning forward, my hands and arms will pretty rapidly turn red. If I stay standing they become very, very red. If I lift them above my head, or even just my heart, they go back to normal almost immediately and then red again when I place them down by my sides. Bloodwork showed elevated liver enzymes so I got an ultrasound that showed fatty liver. I thought it could be POTS because that’s exactly what it looks like when I see videos of other people putting their arms by their sides, but I don’t really get dizzy or light headed at all. I do get a rapid heart rate pretty much as soon as I stand though. I live a pretty depressing life where I spend almost all day every day laying in bed, so I know I’m really out of shape and that alone could explain the elevated heart rate. I just don’t know what to do and it’s significantly, significantly impacting my mental health. It seems to be getting worse over the past couple months. I have an appointment with a gastroenterologist on dec 5th for further look into my liver and a cardiologist on the 20th. I’m going to ask the cardiologist about pots but I really don’t know what else to ask anyone about. My primary care says he’s not concerned about it, but we aren’t talking a little pink here - just trying to make a taco last night my whole arm and hands looked like a tomato. That’s the first time my wife saw it that bad and now even she is concerned but I can’t seem to convince my doctor to take it seriously. I have Medicare due to disability so I don’t think I need a referral to see a specialist, but other than the gastroenterologist and cardiologist I don’t even know where to start looking for answers. Thank you for any recommendations/questions to ask. My face also appears to be getting more red now as well, but that doesn’t change with activity level really. ",2024-11-13 01:39:19

About every 2-3 months I come down with a 12-24 hour bout of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain, just like a stomach virus. Sometimes it is incapacitating and sometimes it is moderately uncomfortable and I can manage while at work. The only common thread I can tell is that it happens pretty regularly at the start of a trip somewhere. (I am not at all a nervous/anxious traveler.) I do not associate these episodes with emotional upset or certain foods, et.  I would say this has been happening for about 4 years. 

The puzzling thing to me is that I have a husband and 2 small kids in daycare, and nobody else gets sick when I do. The vast majority of the time I have no known exposure to a stomach virus.

Was very active growing up did competitive gymnastics and cheer for 10 years, overall very healthy. Ever since getting Covid for the 1st time I’ve had a lot of health issues. I was diagnosed with POTS in 2022, and later more generally dysautonomia in 2023. I have been getting sharp, throbbing referred pain in my jaw, shoulders, arms, sometimes my neck back and stomach, along with symptoms of chest pain, SOB, dizziness, nausea, adrenaline surges, costochondritis, sweaty hands, and sometimes impending doom. I also have tachycardia, my resting HR is usually 80-100 and standing is typically 100-120. BP usually 110/75ish. Sometimes I feel like my heart will flutter or skip and I’ll feel a lump in my throat. For a long time I’ve been worried that my symptoms were angina or heart related. I have seen multiple doctors and cardiologists and they did pretty much all the tests, EKGs, troponin, coronary CT scan, adrenal CT, echos, bloodwork, and also a 72hr holter and a treadmill test although I didn’t really feel symptoms when doing those two. All came back normal. I’m just conflicted, I know my tests came back ok, but my symptoms feel EXACTLY how cardiac issues (like angina) are described. Like to a tee. I don’t think it’s anxiety because I’ve tried benzos and they made me feel calm but symptoms were still there. And the referred pain in all these areas really scares me, especially because they come with chest pain, severe SOB impending doom, nausea, etc. I just want to know if I should be concerned or not. Idk what else to do as far as testing, I’ve done it all I feel. I’m starting to chalk it all up to dysautonomia but I just want to know that I’ll be ok and be sure this isn’t my heart or something to be concerned about, especially because they feel more cardiac than autonomic nervous symptom dysfunction. Also I’m almost always feeling at least some symptoms, but the bad flares can last hours sometimes and can be pretty intense. Exercise sometimes worsens it, but it can and often does occur at rest.

Hi. 52M (5'9"", 185 lbs). About 6 weeks ago, I started having an itching/burning sensation in my urethra and started feeling like I had to pee all the time. Around the same time, I also got a rash on the head of my penis (I'm uncut, if that matters).

Over the past 6 weeks, I've had the following tests:

10/1: RPR Syphilis = Non-Reactive

10/1: HIV 1+2 = Nonreactive

10/1: Chlamydia+GC (Urine, Oral Swab, Anal Swab) = Negative for all

10/2: Urinalysis WBC'S, UA/HPF=11-25

10/2: Urine Culture = <10K CFU/mL of Insignificant Growth

10/2: Urinalysis  LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE, UA=Positive

11/3: Ureaplasma Species and Mycoplasma Hominis Culture (Urethra Swab) = Not Isolated for Both

11/3: Urine Culture = <10K CFU/mL of Insignificant Growth

11/3: Chlamydia+GC (Urine) = Negative for Both

11/3: Herpes Simplex 1 & 2 = Not Detected for Both

11/9: Urinalysis = this time LEUKOCYTES = Negative

When this first started, I was prescribed an anti-fungal cream. This got rid of the rash right away.

I've also taken cycles of the following medications. Not simultaneously.  I'd do the medication, wait a few days or a week and try the next one.

Doxycycline

Meloxicam

Valtrex

Cephalexin

Cranberry Supplements

AZO Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride

None of these have helped.  Any ideas or suggestions that I can take to the urologist?

Since the anti-fungal cream worked on the rash, is it possible to get a fungal infection in the urethra? When I mentioned it to my GP last time, he was dismissive of the idea.

My skin feels like it’s on fire and hurts to graze it with my clothes. My knuckle is throbbing, painful enough that makes me grimace when I think about it. My hand is warm but my finger is freezing. 

As a bit of background, I suspect I have some kind of autoimmune but doctors have been slow to do tests and take me seriously. My mom has rheumatoid arthritis and her sister, my aunt, has lupus. When I’m feeling sick, my legs throb all over, like they did when I had shin splints back in high school. It’s as if every leg bone feels bruised and painful to touch. I don’t experience it when I’m healthy, and it feels inflammatory in nature. 

Anyway, I was typing and noticing a painful sensation on my right hand, as if the skin is burning and irritated at the same time. It reminds me of having a bad scrape and the stinging feeling it gets when it’s fresh. My thumb knuckle is throbbing, like my legs do. Except the rest of my body feels okay. 

I rolled up my sleeve and noticed I have a red patch on my wrist and up my arm, and it feels warm but not painful like my hand.  If I didn’t roll up my sleeve, I never would’ve noticed it. 

I’ve attached pictures below in the comments. I did carry heavy grocery bags on my arms but that was two hours ago and my other arm feels fine. I have never noticed this after carrying heavy bags before. Is it just nerve related? Or is the red skin indicative of something worse, like infection? Is this an autoimmune warning sign? Thank you!

 I've been to 2 different dentists and they couldn't find anything wrong with any of my teeth in several X-rays and a biopsy of my gums. I've been to the doctor and nothing was found in a CT scan.

I’ve read a few pubmed articles that claim it is associated with CVD later in life so the information I’ve got is mixed.

Can someone help me understand these risks to further inform my decision making.

As the title suggests, I have a slightly painful bump forming on my lower left tibia/shin. I only noticed it maybe a week ago and a simple small bump, and with time it seems to be slightly more pronounced and slightly more painful. There is no redness, and upon looking (as opposed to feeling) you wouldn't be able to tell it was there. 

Pressing on it doesnt hurt a lot, but its sort of a dull, low-pain pressure sort of sensation. When running I also feel some slight pressure there. I suppose most of the pressure comes from where the muscle meets the bone, but the bump is certainly on the bone itself. I'll add that the bump is definitely on the ""harder"" side, but when running my finger across it with pressure and forcing it a tad it seems to budge slightly. It seems the past few days its gotten a tad bit more painful, just marginally, but I don't know if that's because I've been ""messing"" with it since Ive noticed it.

For some background I'm 24M, I train quite heavily, with heavy weights and a not so intense half mile run each time I work out. I am also the heaviest I've ever been due to the bodybuilding, around 6'0"" and 180lbs. Ive been on this regime or a slightly similar one for the better part of half a year, but have been lifting weights for some years now. I also have an extensive history of playing soccer/football and volleyball a ton in my childhood, among other sports and have definitely sustained some nasty injuries to this area when I was younger. Also had extensive shin splints when younger.

Brought it up to the doc, he had a hard time finding the bump and he's going to do an ultrasound next week. Didn't say anything else about it.

No medications, I just take Beta Alanine regularly for a skin condition.

Thanks a ton!",2024-11-13 00:10:30

So since December of 2023 I have been dealing with back pain, I made a post here before about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/s/njLxxwbUCg. You don’t have to read it, just more background info if you want it. 

Since that post, I have seen an orthopedic doctor and they thought a number of things. First I got an xray and mri, they detected arthritis but it didn’t seem like a big deal, so they decided to give me steroid shots(called facet joint shots or something) in my spine(initially they thought it was just inflammation). Relieved pain for a bit, stopped working after the 10 days. After that didn’t work, they then got me a Spec CT scan and now they think it is something to do with my arthritis. However they don’t really know what to do about it I guess, so for the past like 2 months I have been waiting on them to set up my appointment with a rheumatologist. They think(not completely sure yet) that I have something called spondylitis, and if I remember correctly it may have been called ankylosing spondylitis. 

With this in mind, what can I do, and what should I do? To be more detailed, before this “injury”, I was active in my sport of MMA and worked out quite often. I want to do it again so bad but I don’t know if I should until I really know what is going on with my back, as MMA(specifically Jiu Jitsu) is how the pain started.

AskDocs,1gpz662,Was this a normal kidney stone experience?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpz662/was_this_a_normal_kidney_stone_experience/,1,"So, let me first start off by saying I’m a 22 year old female who has never had a kidney stone experience in my life. I’ve always heard they were awful but never actually knew what the process was like.

About half a year ago, I had an episode of terrible lower back pain to the point where I was breathless. It lasted maybe 10 minutes, and I was leaving my school campus at the time and decided to quickly take myself to one of the hospitals near campus as my mom also works there. I was told it was probably a muscle spasm and was given muscle relaxers just in case I had another episode in the future.

Flash forward to two days ago, also the same day I got engaged (woohoo!). Things went downhill very fast. Boyfriend proposed, 20 minutes later I never in my life had to pee more than I did at that time. Now fiancé was racing to find the quickest gas station which was another 20 minutes away and about halfway there I was feeling those same back pains I felt half a year ago, except 100x worse. I sounded like I was going into labor, and it freaked my fiancé out!! 

When we arrived to the gas station, I tried to move quickly but found my body was not working and I could barely move. I get to the bathrooms and of course there’s a line, and people were looking at me very weird as I looked like I was going into labor. I wobbled back outside to the car because I felt if I stayed any longer I would’ve fell to the floor. At this point, my breaths turned into pants because of the pain and all of a sudden my hands cramped up then went numb, mouth went numb, still had to pee, knives were being twisted into my lower back, my body broke out in a sweat, heart rate spiked, and the need to vomit came in waves. My fiancé was about to rush me to the hospital but there just so happened to be an ambulance nearby. The EMTs did what they could and chalked it down to me just having an anxiety attack. Eventually I was stable enough for them to help me to a bathroom to pee and it was the most euphoric & orgasmic moment of my life.

I’m just so confused because that is the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my entire existence on earth and I was told I apparently only had an anxiety attack? I’ve been looking up things about other people’s experiences with kidney stones and it seems to pretty much be just like mine. It could’ve slipped past me because I was exhausted but I don’t remember seeing anything in my urine that day and it was a normal pee color. I’m going to see my primary care doctor this Thursday but I just wanted to see if anyone went through anything this specific. Did I experience a kidney stone moving as well as have a panic attack on top of that? Should I prepare to maybe actually pass one some time in the near future?",2024-11-12 23:46:44

I have been wondering why this has happened to me for a while. It started probably about 10 years ago. 

If I take a shower in the morning between the hours of 6am-11am I will become uncontrollably itchy will it will bounce from place to place all over my body. Scratching does nothing to relive it but feel necessary.  The itching is mostly my legs but can really travel anywhere. This also applies to physical exertion say if I were to go for a walk. I have tried everything from various moisturizers lotions, cold water, different soap / shampoo (fragrance free), waiting longer after waking up before doing it, nothing works.

This does not affect me any other time say if I were to shower at 1pm , 5pm, 9pm etc would be completely fine. It’s very weird and I’m wondering why it’s happening?

- even if I don’t eat, I’ll still burp. I can wake up in the morning after not eating anything for 12+ hours and burp. It’s an all day thing
- I’m a healthy individual. I don’t have the best diet nor do I workout as much as I should, but I’m in good shape and wouldn’t consider myself unhealthy by any means
- I rarely drink carbonated beverages or eat cruciferous vegetables
- I sometimes get a buildup of gas that can be quite uncomfortable (not really painful) after eating and will not be able to burp. I usually alleviate this with gas relief tablets 
- this discomfort also happens if I purposely try to stop myself from burping 
- I don’t fart very often, just burp
- they often smell and sometimes smell VERY bad (they usually smell like what I have eaten, but can sometimes manifest into something foul)
- these aren’t forced, it’s just my body ‘doing it’s thing’. Funny enough, I’m not even able to burp on command
- I burped probably about 10 times writing this

I  went to the ER with pelvic pain and spotting in 2018 and they found an 8cm complex cyst on my right ovary. 

I followed up with my gyno after and they just put me on birth control and monitored the cyst for a while and it never went away. After a while they stopped ordering ultrasounds as it remained unchanged 


I got off BC in 2021. I just had a prolonged period (day 16 of bleeding). I went back to the gyno and she ordered a CBC, hormone blood test (though I just had my thyroid blood test last week and that was in range), and an ultrasound. I’m awaiting results. She mentioned the cyst was actually an endometrioma and I have endometriosis. This is the first time I’ve heard that. She also said it wouldn’t cause abnormal bleeding. 

However when the ultrasound tech was looking she said she couldn’t find my left ovary, uterus looked fine, and she did see the cyst on my right ovary and it is 9cm now.

I have also included my referral notes from my GP for the full history below. 

History: 2 years ago I had extremely bad food poisoning, which lasted about a month (vomiting subsided after about 4 days), but diarrhoea and no appetite continued. Before this I’d always had a bit of a sensitive stomach but nothing unusual (bloating/pain sometimes after heavy foods such as pizza). 

Over the next year  I suffered approx 3 vomiting episodes - previously it was extremely rare for me to vomit, less than 1 a year. I assumed it was food related. 

Last October I suffered pain in my lower right abdomen. They suspected it was appendicitis in A&E but after a CT scan the doctor said it was gastritis and I went away with some antibiotics. 

In January I was prescribed Sertraline/Zoloft for anxiety. Now this is where my symptoms SKY ROCKET. I experienced intense nausea and vomiting. It would often stop for a week or so, but I was vomiting on average 3 times a week as well as having diarrhoea. 

I came off Sertraline a couple of months ago, and it didn’t completely help so I had some tests (included in referral below) that came back with nothing. I was put on omeprazole for the last month and the vomiting has stopped although I still get occasional nausea that is intense and acid reflux. 

My tests have ruled out bowel cancer and IBD as well as coeliac. I will say that I’ve cut out dairy which has helped a bit, but again, not completely. 

I feel like I have completely messed my gut up somehow. Does anyone have any initial thoughts? 

Referral:

Thank you for seeing [NAME] who presents with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms.  She reports nausea + vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating and fatigue.  Present for 2 years, the intensity of symptoms have varied.  Primary care investigations have been unremarkable, with normal FIT, stool MC&S, coeliac screening, calprotectin and H. pylori investigations.  Attempts to exclude foodstuffs have been unsuccessful with [NAME] continuing to experience significant malaise secondary to her symptoms.",2024-11-12 19:49:53

Since childhood I have experienced really bad pain in my arms and legs/joints that would be so bad I’d cry. This pain reacts well to advil and ketorolac. It doesn’t react very well to Tylenol. 
I also get fairly bad headaches and migraines . Again they react well to Advil and ketorolac. These pains come on together.
I don’t think it’s due to dehydration as drinking water and electrolytes really doesn’t help or prevent anything. 
On top of these main symptoms I also experience rashes on my hands, wrists, and eyelids. I get a general feeling of unwellness. I’ve been noticing blisters and sores in my mouth, especially on my tongue. Bad body odor. I get awful fatigue in the afternoons. Diarrhea and constipation. These symptoms come in flares. Some days and weeks I feel great, and then it all comes on and I feel flu-like for a couple of days or weeks. Blood sugar drops. 
It gets so much worse if I have experienced a cold or virus. I can’t drink alcohol because it flares me up so bad. 
What tests do I ask for ? Healthcare is bad in Canada and you need to be direct and advocate fiercely for yourself. My naturopath thinks I have a gluten issue but I’m not sure

So I usually don‘t speak about medical matters online, but my doctor has failed me a little bit here and I felt like getting a few more opinions would be helpful.

Context: I have done a skin prick test to confirm my suspicions of having a dustmite allergy. (It was obvious as day, but wanted to confirm it medically) the results came back as followed:

Dustmites 9mm
Pollen 7mm

Cats 4mm
Rabbits 3mm
Dogs 2mm

Hamsters 0mm
Horses 0mm

I was in shock after receiving those results and was crying and panicking a little bit afterwards (i used to have a bunny and a dog, but both passed away before, and never had any problem and i obviously wanted more pets in the future)

My doc has been giving me a weird attitude from the moment i met her but i thought i might just be overthinking it or she is just professional. But the moment i started asking more questions about my animal allergies (how severe are they? Are there therapies? Does it include all animals? Etc), she became extremely irritated and i got too scared of asking more questions. She finished the conversation by firmly saying i should get rid of any ideas of ever having any animals with fur ever in my life again and that i should just get a goldfish. 

I was obviously sad from all of this but at home i realized the 0mm at hamsters and horses and got confused. I‘ve always wanted pet rats, and now seeing this but hearing something else from the doc is confusing. 

So now i just kind of want to have answers here that i can‘t ask to my doctor because of her quite rude demeanor:

How severe is a 2mm allergy or a 4mm one? Was i lied to about how many animals im allergic to? Is there a possibility to own pet rats eventually? (I do not mind mild symptoms that can be controlled) 

I read online that allergy results from under 3mm dont get counted as positive in the first place. All in all im just confused about whats going on. I‘m only in my early 20‘s and dont want to give up having pets in my life just yet, even if the chances arent big.

I’ve been having a problem with my breathing since forever and I’m still not sure what the problem is and how I could improve this.

My breathing has always been a problem for me. The things I (have) experienced are:

- I have experienced wanting to take a deep breath yet when I did I would get a sharp pain in my chest. This has happened to me mostly in the past and not as often and would disappear within a few minutes.

- very often my breathing would catch my attention and at times it seemed like I wasn’t getting enough air so I had to force myself to take deep breaths 

- I used to bike everyday to school, I would always be out of breath, sweating-what I would call-excessively and a stomach ache. This has never improved even though I did it for at least 4 years or something. This is one of the most troubling as I’ve been trying to get fit and exercise but any time I do I am so out of breath. What prompted me to write this is as I was just exercising and I experienced this again, but this time I saw white and stars and felt faint and it scared me a bit. My right ear went also deaf for a moment and weirdly right after that I had a bowel movement.

I have been to my gp about this and she put out to two options: either a wrong breathing technique or asthma. She prescribed me an inhalator and I used it before exercising, but again, I saw stars and felt faint anyway. 

I also have anxiety and depression and was thinking that anxiety might play a role in this as I’ve always been a bit anxious about my breathing and if I’m getting enough air, but recently I started taking antidepressants and I noticed my anxiety has depleted, but I could assume that the bodily effects don’t just go away.

Also from being young I’ve always sucked in my stomach which led to breathing more from the chest (I’ve been trying to reverse this but it still doesn’t feel natural to breath through my stomach) 

Could someone please advise me on this? I have been struggling with this so long and I’m eager to improve this but I just don’t understand what the problem could be. Thanks you in advance!",2024-11-12 23:14:58

Currently not on any meds. 5'3"". Weight of 138lbs.

Since I was younger, I was always spraining my ankles. In high school, I recall a bad sprain where it felt like my ankle almost snapped in half. My mom took me to the beds urgent care. They didn't find anything on the x-ray and said it was only a sprain. Around 3 years ago, I stepped off my high family balcony and sprained my ankle. I got it checked later and they didn't find anything on a x-ray. They recommend an MRI but found nothing.

Since then, I've been having random and intermittent ankle pain. I can wake up one day and step out of bed and I pain get a shooting feeling up the side of my left ankle. It would mainly happen when i'm getting up or moving. It would happen intermittently, on or off and last for like a week then just disappear for like a month or two before randomly coming back.

I've moved to another state, a colder state. I moved in the summer when it was hot though. Since being here, the pain has been happening frequently. The pain itself isn't constant, it's still random but the pain itself has been happening on and off since June now. I have seen a DPM and he took an x-ray and finally noted that I have an extra ossicle on my left side. He believes that this can be what's causing my pain. Following up with an MRI, if shows I have a partial tear in my ATFL and I also have a osteochondreal lesion measure 8 x 5 mm on the right side. The doc said that he believes that it still is this extra bone and they typically don't touch lesions unless it's symptomatic. 

I've tried ankle brace (it makes the pain worse). Insoles. We have tried a lidocaine and steroid injection which didn't help at all. Randomly I started feeling pain on my right side, which never happened before. It started from 1700 one night and lasted until 1200 the next day every single time I walked. The doc then placed me in a boot for a week and then I am to start PT tomorrow. I've still had some pain even with the boot on but intermittently. 

The pain can be sharp and that's typically on the left side. But now on the right side, sometimes I'm having an internal aching. I don't know if I'm really just making this up with my mind because I am more aware of my ankle or if it's really getting worse.

The doc said that the bone isn't causing any structural damage but I just find it so strange that suddenly I moved to another states and it's becoming much more frequent. He wants me to try PT for the next 6 weeks if not then surgery because we have exhausted all other options. I'm currently in a boot.

I was wondering if anyone else may have any input or if anyone else has seen this before? Would PT help at all given its an extra bone or should it just be taken out?

I'm just worried that my mind is becoming more hyper aware of my ankle than it was before and causing these symptoms. Currently having no pain but had some earlier walking out of bed and even with the boot on walking around today.

I started taking prozac roughly 2 months ago otherwise no medication 

Every time I’ve gone running, I end up with a cough and light trouble breathing for the rest of the day and occasionally the next day. When I inhale, my throat and lungs feel ticklish/wheezy and it makes me cough. 

I’m generally fit, I typically go walking anywhere from 3-5 miles a day, and have done sports most of my life. I did track and cross country up until about 2 years ago. I went to the ER a few times because of breathing issues when they got really bad. It used to be the coughing the day of and after running, but with choking and being unable to breathe. I also had bad collar bone pain and a burning throat. 

I don’t go on long runs anymore like I used to so it’s been much less of a problem. I was told that they didn’t really know what the problem was, and gave me an inhaler which I have since lost and never figured out how to use properly.

It’s not something that has gotten better or worse over the years, and I’ve had it since I was 14 or 15 or so. 

I ran for less than 20 seconds today to get to my class on time and have had the feeling since. It was 2-3 hours ago

Trying to determine if the doctors questions were appropriate. 

Hi, hesitant to post but wanted to ask if these questions the doctor asked me were appropriate. 

I got a UTI last night and made an appt today with Dr on demand. I’m in California if it matters. 

When the Dr joined the call I could only see the top of his head and the smoke detector was beeping every minute. He started listing my medications and I explained that they were all from a surgery I had a couple of months ago. He asked me what the surgery was and I told him it was a breast implant revision. 

He then asked me if I got silicone or saline implants and whether or not they were lifetime implants or if I had to exchange them in 15 years. This was super awkward. We hadn’t even gotten to my reason for the visit yet. 

Once we finally got to the reason for visit and I described my symptoms he asked me if I had any new sexual partners or if I’ve been in a jacuzzi lately. Then he asked me if my partner is circumcised and if there was any growth on him. 

Finally he agreed to prescribe antibiotics to my nearest Walgreens. 

Are these normal questions? It’s been years since I’ve had a UTI but I used to get chronic UTIs when I was in my 20s. I just don’t recall being asked these types of questions in the past. 

Edit: thanks for all the replies. Sounds like these questions are all within the range of normal for the most part. I think the fact that I couldn’t see the doctors face kind of put me on edge from the get go, plus the detailed questions about my implants really threw me for a loop. Appreciate the help!

Hx of recurrent MDD and anxiety, taking 200mg lamotrigine daily. 

I recently established care with a new PCP who expressed a desire to change my psych meds. I am prescribed 0.5mg clonazepam for anxiety attacks which I use once per month at most. I often go months without using it. This medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist and has been monitored by her for 5 years. In fact, she encourages me to use it more based on my anxiety levels, but I am very conservative in its use as I prefer behavioral anxiety management methods if possible. 

My new PCP stated that he’d like me to descale the clonazepam- which I think is unusual because I have absolutely no dependence- and use propranolol instead because it’s safer. I am aware that long-term benzodiazepine use carries risk for downstream issues including dementia, but my understanding is that this occurs with chronic use, not very occasional use. I have never heard of any significant risks associated with once monthly or less use, and I regularly hear psychiatrists prescribing quite a bit more. Is this more of a setting/liability issue? 

Unfortunately, I feel that expressing any disagreement with this plan will make it sound like I “need” benzodiazepines. I don’t. But I want my care to be managed by a psychiatrist I trust (don’t have one yet due to moving states and psychiatrist shortage) and don’t appreciate my meds being switched by someone who doesn’t know me. 

Can someone help me understand the actual
medical risks of very low clonazepam usage? Or do you think this has more to do with liability?

In July, I got anxiety attack impacting my breathing and I started 2-3 xanax per day. The 31st July a bat flew above my head (20-25cm?) and I immediately thought about rabies and made the vaccine. After that, I increased my daily dose to 1.25 mg per day because otherwise It would have been impossible due to anxiety. 

In the beginning of September I started to have the sensation of loosing the ability of breathing automatically and went to the hospital. After this day, I cold turkey xanax and went to the hospital 2 days after. 

In hospital, I started to have Depersonalization/Derealization because I though I will d*e. After this, my anxiety about rabies and dying decreased. I started eschitalopram (SSRI) and it helped me against my depression. However, with the feeling of DPDR decreasing since mid october, I start having the same issue with breathing automatization.

Hey everyone. For the past 5 months now, I've been dealing with some weird symptoms, which I haven't been able to explain. My doctor is convinced it's anxiety related, which could totally be right. However although I do have anxiety, I feel like my anxiety has only really gotten bad, due to my psychological symptoms of whatever I'm dealing with. Would love to get a 2nd opinion on what might be going on in my head and what directions I should be pursuing. I'm currently not on any prescribed medication, and do basic cardio exercises + eat a relatively healthy diet.

  
For context, prior to these symptoms starting, I has stressed out at work, with my relationship, and did 200mg of MDMA at a festival around 3 weeks prior to my symptoms starting. That was only the 2nd time I did MDMA, and haven't done any sort of drugs since. I only occasionally did drugs. Would never call myself a frequent user, as usually any partaking was months and months apart.

  
Symptoms which started 5 months ago:

\- Intensified Hypnic Jerks and Adrenaline rushes when I try to go to bed. I will get hypnic jerks a handful of times as I drift off to sleep. Same with Adrenaline rushes. Usually they don't accompany each other. I get these about 95% of the time I try to sleep.

\- Feeling depersonalized, and that I'm disconnected from the world. This sensation varies from day to day. Head feels like I'm high on something but I should be completely sober feeling. Head just feels weird and off. On good days, I feel like myself. On bad days, it's like my mind is constantly in a state of grogginess, or heavy feeling. My cognitive abilities are still fine. I can see just as good, drive, and work just as well as I could, although my mind is sort of telling me that I can't, if that makes sense. **The weird thing about this symptom is that I can generally tell how I'm going to feel that day from the moment I wake up.** Never do I get half way through my day, and the depersonalization comes on. If it is there that day, I can tell from the moment I wake up.

  
Since this all started, I have had an MRI done (Came back unremarkable), general blood test done (Everything apparently was normal). I Had a sleep study done, which apparently showed minor sleep apnea and the intensified hypnic jerks, but was told the sleep apnea was too minor to worry about a CPAP machine, and was told there wasn't much I could do about the hypnic jerks other than watch how anxious I am. I was prescribed Mirtazapine (which I stopped taking after 5 days, as the side effects were too sever and interfered with work). I was prescribed Klonopin, but only to take if I was really really struggling to sleep on a once a week basis. So far I have only taken it once to help with sleep.

  
Would love to hear what other docs might think is going on. I was referred to a neurologist to run an EEG test, but being in Canada, I am going to have to wait months before I finally see someone.

Thanks!

for some patient history, i’m 23f, 5’1, about 155 lbs, no major health conditions, and just over a year postpartum. i’ve been on birth control ever since i gave birth, and i vaped prior to pregnancy (baby was planned, so i quit before conceiving) and started back a couple months PP. no, i didn’t know how dangerous it can be to vape on birth control pills.

around 3 weeks ago, i started having pain all over my right calf. different types of pain too, like the back and sides had the tightening feeling, and the front basically on the shin bone felt like a stabbing pain. this has stayed pretty constant, and just gotten worse. it was never unbearable aside from the occasional “flare up” i guess, where it would suddenly be worse for a minute or so and then die back down to how it always is. i stopped my birth control around this time due to planning to switch to an IUD and just being bad about actually taking it daily, which has caused my period to be crazy irregular. i eventually just googled the type of pain i was feeling and almost all of the symptoms lined up with a blood clot, aside from the front stabby pain. however, i never saw any discoloration, visible swelling, or vein differences, aside from my right calf veins appearing bigger or darker than on the left.

a few days ago, the pain got much worse, and that day i almost fainted during one of the “flare ups.” i was sitting cross legged on the floor when the pain got bad, not putting any weight or strain on it. before i passed out i had bad chest pain, but i truly believe the pain along with the worry that i’ve possibly had a blood clot in my leg just gave me an anxiety attack, and that caused the chest pain and the near-fainting (i laid back and my friend got water to me before i was fully out and don’t remember ever fully losing consciousness.) that night, i went into urgent care because i decided that if it was causing me that much anxiety, its worth being sure that’s not the case. front desk took me very seriously, triage took me very seriously, doctor didn’t seem to consider it a possibility. she said shin splints due to a change in exercise routine (i corrected that i, unfortunately, do not exercise outside of walking around a house and picking up a baby) and/or phlebitis. she told me to “take an aspirin,” didn’t specify the dose, and put me on a steroid for a week. said if that doesn’t help, go get an x ray for shin splints and sent me on my way. 

that night the pain got much worse, keeping me up for hours. i couldn’t stop thinking i wished she would have at least tried to check. she felt around for a couple seconds and looked at the color and ruled it out, so i felt we didn’t really do much of anything other than talk. the next day i could barely drive because it hurt to even use my right leg to push down, it hurt to walk, it hurt to put weight on it, hurt to bend my ankle, etcetc. i went through the whole day taking my aspirin and steroids with the pain only increasing. when my husband got off, he urged me to go to the ER (we have several in our area, one had the ER closed for a long time and recently reopened, and has been known before and now for having very little traffic and little to no wait times.)

I went in and luckily, there was not a SINGLE person in the ER lol. they took me straight back, got vitals and history, drew blood, and i waited for the doctor. he came in and originally was a bit snarky, saying i must have diagnosed myself from google, but seemed more understanding once i explained the birth control+vape connection on top of pain meds not helping for 3 weeks. he explained that they don’t have an ultrasound??? but he could run a d dimer test, which we did. luckily, it came back at a 0. we shared our happiness that i did NOT have a blood clot, but when i asked what could be causing it, he said he had no clue. we went back and forth a bit, he would suggest maybe i pulled a muscle, i would say i don’t remember doing so; he would suggest i use the right leg to bounce my baby, but i strictly use my left (for some reason). we literally couldn’t think of a single thing wrong with my leg. he finally told me to treat it like a torn muscle, continue my pain meds, apply heat, and try to rest it as much as i can get away with, and follow up with a PCP if it still hurts in a week. this brings me to today.

i have a limp, no position relieves the pain, i can feel a “swelling” if i squeeze in, but no size difference in the calf. i’ve been at a loss, but just remembered that a few weeks back, around the time the pain started, i got a leg cramp. my husband was giving me a back massage (no really, i know what you’re thinking lmao. but my back sucks.) and as soon as the cramp hit i kinda kicked my leg up (aka back, since i was on my stomach) and my husband pinned it back down. i’m known for accidentally kicking during back massages and he thought that was what was going on, but i fought him on it and eventually moved my leg to a position that “released???” the cramp. i forgot about it until now. could THAT be what’s caused weeks of pain? it was the same leg, in the same area, but i don’t understand why that would lead to long term pain. i’d love any experiences or ideas",2024-11-12 22:27:29

My parents are divorced.  
He has been relying on our country very badly managed/poorly funded/hard to  
access public healthcare psychiatry. He has no one but me. We have tried twice  
to find more ""expensive"" private psychiatrists with very poor  
results. I am not living there so hard for me to call in from abroad and talk  
to docs. When he is on them he is in a zombie drool like state. He tried to  
reduce/eliminate some of them in the last few months, but came to a breaking  
point a few days ago. His main symptoms, currently, are 1 ocd/obsessive  
thoughts, 2 major difficulty falling and staying a sleep, and 3 general  
constant restlessness.

His currently prescribed  
those medications, daily:

Evening:  


clonazepam 2mg

olanzapine 5mg

  
non psych:

atorvastatin (as calcium)  
40mg

  
Morning:

escitalopram (as oxalate)  
10 mg  
carbamazepine 400 mg

 

Non psych:

plavix tab 75mg

  
I understand the most reasonable and safe  
option is to find a qualified doctor, unfortunately the situation in his home  
country is that it will take 10-18 months to get a spot with a public  
psychiatrist. I tried in the past to find well reviewed private ones online but  
I am very limited to the amount of vouching/follow-through/communication,  
living in the other side of the world with a complete different time zones.  
Some of them are hesitant to even talk to me.

What would you do? What  
are my options? What do you think about his current meds, dosage and frequency.

I just got back from an appointment to confirm what l already knew - l've got a pretty severely deviated septum, confirmed by CT scan.

Also looks like l've got enlarged turbinates and one nostril has valve collapse.

The doctor never met with me — I met with their physician's assistant, which is fine, but now l've got concerns because some of their one star reviews are freaking me out.

The PA recommended a balloon sinusplasty and valve repair using heat(?)... she said it would be four things — the balloon procedure, the valve repair, turbinate reduction, and micro fractures to straighten the septum.

She said I'd be in and out in 20 min...

I see many good reviews, but the few bad reviews are making me second guess.

Docs: if you had a deviated septum with a need for valve repair / turbinate reduction, would you get a classic septo-rhinoplasty, or balloon sinusplasty?",2024-11-12 22:17:17

33F, white, USA.

My periods are normally every 30 days or so, but can come a day early/late. I normally have light bleeding the first day, heavy on day two and three, then light bleeding on day four and five.

My last period came a day early but I only bled for 48 hours and it was light the entire time. I've never had a period that short/light!!

That was about a week and a half ago and today I masturbated with a vibrating toy. I've had light spotting after sex previous times, but today I had an incredibly large amount of brown discharge! Like, I wiped 5 or 6 times and the toilet paper was just COVERED in brown discharge each time. Nowhere close to the normal few drops of spotting.

What on earth could be going on? Is this early menopause or something?

Other details that may or may not be relevant: I've been losing handfuls of hair every day. Lots and lots of hair. My hair is practically half its thickness in the last few months. I also periodically get debilitating cramps for absolutely no reason, not in relation to my period. It happens normally in the middle of a cycle and feels like it's coming from just inside my right hip. The pain will be severe for several hours, then it just magically clears up. No bowel movements or gas occurs at these times, so I don't think it's constipation-related. But like, I literally can't move or walk or hardly talk when it happens.

I have recently started taking Effexor as a migraine preventative. That was approximately 3-4 months ago. 150mg/day.

Any idea what could be going on? More specifically, am I over reacting for being concerned? I hate going to the doctor only for them to say everything looks fine, like has happened in the past. I went to an OBGYN a couple years ago for the random cramping and she just did a physical exam/palpation and said everything was fine except for excess scarring from my C-sections. She was very rude and abrupt and simply said to use more lube during sex, which is not the issue whatsoever.

Since the Wednesday before Halloween I’ve been having shortness of breath problems, for the 7 days after that It would get to the point where I felt like I couldn’t intake a full breath no matter how hard I inhaled, other times I felt like I could breathe just fine, last Monday I went to get checked for allergies or whatever was causing it. But all they discovered was I had a virus, with only shortness of breath, chest pain and tightness, and dizziness/fatigue/ nausea, and a fever. They told me to take Tylenol/ibuprofen and robitussen for it. But never told me what specific virus I had (I assume upper respiratory infection) anyways, from that Monday to Wednesday I was only eating chicken noodle soup, saltine crackers, and pbj’s, a lot of water, and a couple ginger ales. The shortness of breath remained, and I got constipated to the point where I couldn’t pass a stool, so I went to the ER for it, they gave me magnesium citrate and told me to return if it doesn’t work, so I kept taking doses as prescribed and waited a couple days, still nothing so I returned and they gave me lactulose. It came in a small cup like you’d put a serving of syrup in, it had 30ml and I only took a 15ml dosage of it. Finally was able to pass stools afterwards, and it’s been over the 48 hours between the dose and now but I’m still experiencing shortness of breath and cramping in my right side of my abdomen. 



Every time i went to the hospital they said my lungs sounded fine and never said my vitals or heart rate was bad either. And im not experiencing any other allergy symptoms that could cause shortness of breath and a tight feeling chest.

And yesterday I suddenly had a strange sensation, not painful, almost like a weird contracting feeling in my sinuses on my cheeks on either side of my nose.


I’m just wondering if it’s a side effect of the lactulose, something from the “upper respiratory infection”, or maybe allergies or anxiety. If anyone can help explain what’s going on I would appreciate it.

They started abruptly one night after a stressful day with a 10-15 min episode of my heart pounding with what felt like an irregular rhythm.  After that I started feeling palps a few times a week and eventually became daily. I’ve worn 2 7 day holters that both showed PVCs/PACs and a couple short runs of SVT. I’ve had an echo (normal) and stress echo (several short SVT runs). I’ve seen 3 different cardiologists/EPs. None of them are concerned. I have an Rx for metoprolol to use as needed- it does help when I have a longer episode (always happens at night).

No one seems to be concerned with finding a root cause. This all came out of nowhere and I’d like to hopefully figure out a cause rather than throw meds at the symptoms. 

I did a food sensitivity panel that came back as highly sensitive to gluten and dairy and have recently cut both from my diet. Too early to tell if it’s made a huge difference, but could that be the culprit of all this?

I am hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction or to the right type of doctor because I am struggling to find relief or answers.

  
I am a 40 year old who is a vegetable farmer by trade.  Everyone has their quirks and ails but overall I would have described myself as active, full of energy, strong and healthy but someone who always catches way too many colds.  3.5 months ago, I was knocked down by a virus and was bed ridden for 2 weeks.  That virus turned into Pnuemonia.  I was seen by a doctor and prescribed doxy for a week.  Half way through the treatment I started to get sicker, so I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Amox-Clav for another week.  At the height of the pnuemonia I was extremely sick, and was very close to going to the emergency room. After two weeks of rest I finally started to get better. In the beginning I was tested for strep and covid multiple times and all those tests were negative.

As I was rejoining the world I discovered how weak I had become. I kept trying to go back to work but getting knocked back down.  I  just had a very bad pnuemonia so I was willing to give my body some time to heal but that never happened.  Instead I started gaining all these new ailments, one by one and now I have had a slew of problems for the last three months.

I have extreme GERD.  I had an endoscopy and thankfully there is no cancer.  But the Gerd symptoms are present all day long. I have a raging headache, jaw pain,  ear pressure pain, a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, a feeling of choking and intense chest tightening and burning sensations.  I am now on a PPI and have drastically altered my diet and actions around food. It has gotten a little better, but it's still quite bad. I also have a very thick white, hairy plaque growing on my tongue that I can't get rid of no matter how much I brush, flush and tongue scrape.

  
I have stomach issues.  My stomach gurgles all the time, I am either constipated or have diarrhea and lot's of bloating and gas.  I did a hydrogen breath test, and my hydrogen levels were fine, but I tested positive for excess methane.  I will have a colonoscopy, but it does make sense for my gut biome to be our of wack after taking a bunch of antibiotics.  
  
I have reproductive organ issues.  I have had shooting pain in my pelvis that are very intense.  I am also having all types of cramping and irregular spotting for months and extremely sharp shooting pains in my left side.  I have an appt with OBGYN in a week but I have been tested multiple times for yeast infections and UTI's that were all negative.  I was also given a week of antifungal medication to treat thrush, just in case because of the white tongue and pelvis pain (my mouth was also tested for candida and came back negative).  In addition I am having bladder issues.  My bladder always feels full and uncomfortable and I feel like I have to pee all the time.  I am not urinating less though, I just still feel like I have to go when I don't.  I had a right side ultrasound and my right kidney, gallbladder etc... all looked fine.

I'm incredibly weak and sore.  My joints are so stiff and painful.  Specifically my hands, wrists, knees, hips, and ankles.  I feel like I have aged 10 years in the last 3 months.  It's the worst first thing in the morning and at night but it's a huge change from my movement ability pre illness.

  
Lastly my eyes are so swollen, dry and achey all the time.  In addition to them hurting, when I look in the mirror I look exhausted and ill.

If I obtained all these symptoms during my illness and they were just taking a long time to get better, I would be less concerned.  Instead the GERD came on slowly and kept getting worse and worse.  The pelvis pain was very minimal for quite some time and then a month in, started to feel really extreme.  My joints feel like they are getting stiffer by the day. Whatever is happening to me feels like it's escalating as opposed to abating.  I have largely been out of work for 3.5 months, I spend most of my time on the couch and I am starting to feel like a prisoner in my body.  

Is there something that could be causing all of these symptoms?  It seems crazy to think I have 4 separate issues, and not one root cause.  I've done multiple standard blood panels lately and my sed rate and c-reactive protein levels were unremarkable so early on we had ruled out rheumatoid arthritis but maybe this is some sort of autoimmune disease?

I'm so stinking tired, in so much pain and everything feels so much harder because I don't know how to fix it.  Any leads or advice would be very much appreciated.

I have been having upper-GI issues (on top of my regularly scheduled IBS) for a couple of weeks now, and it’s likely that I will have to have an endoscopy. I’m wondering if my risk for colon cancer would make it worthwhile to do both the endoscopy and the colonoscopy.

So this is not about me but my grandmother which I live with. She's 88 and takes medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol & blood thinners. She doesn't have any specific diagnosis but that's rather because she hardly goes to the doctor and when she goes she doesn't tell them all what's wrong with her well being. Years ago they said to her that she has gall stones but she didn't want to be operated so nothing ever happened after that. I can't remember when it started but probably over a year ago now, that she's vomiting really often. In the begging it was like every 2-4 weeks, still not normal but not alarming I guess. In the past week she vomited 3 times. In the last couple of months it was mostly once a week. Its always in the evening, mostly when she lies in bed and reading before sleeping. She says that she gets nausea and after she vomits the neusea and the pain that she sometimes also has, is gone. She always says that the pain and the vomiting comes from the gallbladder stones but idk about that. If it would come after she ate things that are not good for the gallbladder I would get it but that's not the case. I searched the internet for days but I still couldn't figured out what it could be. I think that the nausea and the vomiting only appears after she's lying down is probably the most important point. Could it be something like Stomach Cancer? Or a chronic Gastritis? Unfortunately her GP is no help because she's downplaying the situation and won't tell him everything. So i think it would be helpful to know what it could be, going with her the next time and then trying to talk to her GP to look deeper into thir matter. I'm anxious af because I love my grandn dearly and I really don't want her to be seriously ..n and if there is something wrong that she gets the help for it.

I’m 34F and I’m experiencing some issues that I would finally like to go to the doctor for, but not sure how to discuss this or what kind of testing to request. 

For the last 3 months I’ve been feeling constant fatigue. I feel like I’m moving in slow motion. I’m constantly confused, my husband will tell me things, or tell me I said something, and I will immediately forget what was said maybe 5-10 minutes later. The fatigue and brain fog is getting worse by the day. I thought maybe it was due to diet so this last week I started a new high protein, moderate fat, low carb diet. The week I started this diet, my period was supposed to start during the weekend, but it never came and it’s now 4 days late. I think I’m having some kind of hormonal issue. 

I’m currently 7 months post partum after having a stillbirth. I then had an emergency gallbladder surgery a month later, and then was in a car crash this summer. I suppose I’m still recovering from all of these things but it feels like I’m getting worse and not better. I don’t know what to test for or what to do. I have no energy at all. I feel tired just typing this. I’ve been sleeping about 8-9 hours every night this last week and then falling asleep randomly through out the day. 

I wake up and make iced coffee (almond milk and black coffee) and it gives me no energy. I constantly feel like I’m out of my body. I feel like I’m looking at the world through a plastic bag no matter how much I rub my eyes it doesn’t get clearer. I want to start exercising but I feel so weak I can’t even walk to my mailbox without feeling dizzy and like I’ll pass out. I try to do small housework tasks and after about 10 minutes I have to sit down because I feel out of breath and light headed.

My husband said it’s “keto flu” but I keep explaining to him I’ve been feeling like this for months, it’s just that it’s at its peak this week. He doesn’t think I’m pregnant, he thinks the diet has changed my period.

I decided to measure how much water I drink because I only ever drink when I’m thirsty, and if I don’t drink water I have a tendency to feel faint (feeling faint when dehydrated has been an issue since I was a kid). 

I started logging the amount of water I drink each day in my notes app but switched over to a water tracking app later. In July/August I was drinking around 3500ml per day, September about 3000ml and October 2500ml. I noticed in October as the weather got warmer (southern hemisphere) I have been feeling a lot thirstier, but I had been trying to cut back after reading an article about the dangers of drinking too much water. I felt generally better when I was drinking 3500ml on average (typically in the range of 3 to 4 litres) even though i had to use the toilet a lot and my urine was very clear I never felt dehydrated or faint.

But I do find myself more tired untill I take a lot of naps but that could be lack of sleep since im waking up in the middle of the night. I went to a nurse and she said I don't have strep throat but I have to wait til tomorrow for more tests to be done (school level nurses btw). I do feel like it is going away but in other ways it just feels like it is swapping out symptoms (Example, eariler in the week I had alot of throat pain but I could talk and have energy, but now it is the opposite other than the talking part but im barely understandable) also before it became hard to open my mouth I saw in the mirror that in the inside of my right mouth was white cracks on the side wall near my tonsils",2024-11-12 21:11:58

Hi all, have been dealing with a pretty terrible rash now for approx 3 months. Started out on my feet as tiny red dots which dispersed into huge red welts. I’ve been unfortunate enough to have dealt with scabies before (about two years ago, took me forever to get rid of) so I immediately jumped into treatment fearing that was the cause. Blitzed myself with x2 treatments of benzyl benzoate followed by a course of malathion. During this treatment I noticed red blotches on my elbows in addition to the foot rash (https://i.imgur.com/tDNjmXB.jpeg).

The rash would go through days of improvement only to come back worse than before. Same on the elbows - some days it was there, some days it was virtually gone. I went to my GP who said it could be ringworm. He prescribed me with an oral and cream anti-fungal. Used these for a month to no avail. Went back again and was given another set of anti-fungals, both oral and cream form (all different medications, so four different anti-fungal treatments now total). This second course I just completed last week. 

The rash on my feet seemed to have improved significantly in recent days but has now returned (https://i.imgur.com/l4Lch8e.jpeg ). And to add salt to the wound I noticed another rash yesterday on my wrist (https://i.imgur.com/wHm8n6Q.jpeg). I went back to my GP today and he was a bit bewildered - gave me a week’s worth of oral corticosteroids and said if that didn’t work I’d need a dermatologist referral. Unfortunately the waiting list for said referrals (even if you choose to go private) is at least 3 months.

Worth noting that the rash definitely gets worse when I’m sweaty/hot - it’s notably more inflamed if I’ve been wearing shoes all day and moving around a lot. It also doesn’t really itch at all, nor is my sleep ever interrupted at night. The most I’ve felt is a prickly sensation. Furthermore, neither my partner (who I’ve slept next to multiple times while I’ve had this rash) or housemates have shown any similar symptoms.

Hoping someone here can provide some insights. I suffer pretty bad with anxiety so this is taking its toll - would love to know the best course of action while I wait an inevitably long time for a derm visit.",2024-11-12 21:11:07

Family History of Clotting:

- Grandfather: Multiple DVTs after age 70
- 3 paternal cousins and one of their children: History of DVTs, on permanent blood thinners
- Brother's daughter (3): Recently treated for Kawasaki Disease

Questions:

1. Is this clustering of clotting disorders in one family statistically unusual? My hematologist said ""common things occur commonly"" but I'm seeing different diagnoses (Protein S deficiency vs antiphospholipid syndrome) within the same family.

2. Recent hematologist visit revealed my clot may have been in a peripheral vein rather than a deep vein - questioning if permanent blood thinners were necessary. Seeking thoughts on this.

3. Regarding my 3-year-old niece's Kawasaki Disease:
   - Could our family history of clotting disorders have predisposed her to Kawasaki Disease?
   - Given both the family history and Kawasaki Disease, is she at higher risk for future clotting issues?

Additional Context:
There was initially a missed diagnosis with my DVT - D-dimer (4.68) was attributed to weight and I was discharged, only to be admitted 3 weeks later when the clot was found (D-Dimer 18.96). This occurred in a different town from my regular hematologist.

In October 2024, I had very high heart rate after exercising and it didn’t come down for almost an hour. Went to urgent care, they did EKG and sent me to ER. 
ER dr did echo ultrasound, CT scan my lung, blood work. Everything came back normal except my troponin level was on the low end of heart attack indication, which later on they said I didn’t have a HA. Anyways they kept me there for the night to observe and more tests. Everything came back normal. They sent me home with HR monitor for 30 days, no meds. 

Ever since then, I’ve been having little symptoms here and there, very random… example: dizziness when standing, heart racing, elevated heart rate ~120 ish but only last about 2-3 minutes. Some triggers that I noticed are caffeine, emotional stress, standing up too fast. 

Today, I had a bad episode of heart rate going up to 140 while resting, shortness of breath, arms tingling so I had to go to ER again and they said I’m fine, it’s just ST. They call the heart rate monitor team (Phillips) to evaluate my EKG at the moment. They said I should sit down next time and wait it out and also keeping track of the symptoms. 

My question is I’m not sure when I should call dr?! In the moment I felt like I’m having a heart attack (I’m not being dramatic, it felt like that in the moments) but I’m too scared if I wait it out, something bad going to happen. These episodes have been very random that it make me anxious… I’ve been trying to avoid triggers but I also want to exercising… 

Any tips on trying to lower heart rate when I experience an episode? ",2024-11-12 21:07:41

I have trouble taking antibiotics. For years now, I have noticed strange side effects when taking these drugs in response to different infections. Doxycycline, amoxicillin, clindamycin, bactrim, and now azithromycin. Usually after a few doses, I notice nasusea, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, and lightheadedness. Often, these effects are so intense that they are worse than the symptoms they are treating. It is as though antibiotics cause a flare of my uinderlying pathology. I am currently on azithromycin for multiple throat infections and will finish the course. I find that the side effects are most pronounced immediately following consumption to about 90 minutes later. What is happening here? I would like to understand the meaning of this reaction, by thinking about the right mechanism. 

Is it just a bad microbe balance that I could fix with the right strain of probiotic?

When I was younger(19-20), I made the mistake of taking minocycline for acne, for months at a time on multiple occaisons. Is it possible that I seriously compromised my gut microbiome with these, and am highly sensitive/dysbiotic as a result? 

I also went through cold-turkey benzo withdrawal a few years back. Many folks who have gone through that speak about this phenomena, as if years later antibiotics cause them to feel a set back in the recovery from benzos. 

I am also open to the possibility that these drugs are treating an underlying hidden infection I am unaware of, causing a J. Herxheimer reaction. My only hesitation with this is that the intensity of the reaction is most pronounced while my gut is processing the drugs, rather than their half-life in my blood. 

If anyone has any insight on this matter, I would greatly appreciate your help. ",2024-11-12 21:06:56

The rest of the infornation provided in this section might not be very relevant or useful, but I'll provide it just in case. I've been diagnosed with autism, ADHD and depression, and I currently take medication for depression, anxiety, ADHD, high blood pressure and chronic heartburn. Might have some kind of autoimmune disorder, but I've given up on trying to pursue a possible diagnosis for that. I'm also overweight. Got an IUD put in a year ago, and had my gallbladder removed in early 2023.

Current complaint: I haven't been sexually active since early 2020 apart from occasional masturbation a couple times a year, which hasn't caused any issues so far. However, some months ago I started to form a relationship with a man online. We've been sexting quite a bit, which has led me to masturbate the most frequently I ever have, as I did so daily for a week, and every 1-2 days after that.

At some point I noticed a weird trend, where whenever I reached the orgasm, my throat would suddenly feel really itchy and almost like it was closing up? It never got bad enough to disturb my breathing, but it makes me cough for multiple minutes. The itching starts within 30 seconds or so of the orgasm, and lasts for 3 - 7 minutes, sometimes longer.

There should be nothing that I could be allergic to; no lube, no condoms, no cum. It doesn't seem to be linked to the physical exercise practiced. 

The only thing I can think of is that I had a flu recently, that started in early september and lasted for over a month. I had no taste in the first week or so, suggesting to me it might've been covid. I've also had Long Covid once before, although that was very different.

So, any clues what this might be caused by? I appreciate any and all feedback you might have.",2024-11-12 12:21:01

FtM, 31, 165, 5'5"". On zyrtec, omeprazole, advair discus, singulair, and prozac. Dx'd with asthma, hiatal hernia, eczema, Scoliosis. Ddx'd small fiber neuropathy.

Hi there. 👋 it's been almost 5 years of trying to nail down a diagnosis. My symptoms started after I had a bizarre menningitis-like episode in April of 2020. My legs started going numb on and off, starting at the foot and working it's way painfully up to my torso. During these episodes I cannot curl my toes and the pain I have is from the paresthesia but not so much external input. (Aka you could stab my feet and I would not feel it). In the interem between now and onset of those symptoms I have gained fatigue, aches in my joints, abdominal discomfort, sudden weight loss (~30 lb in 3 months), and my breathing/asthma has been nearly unconctrollable.

Initially my doctor was concerned about MS. We went through the testing and MRI's and nothing alarming came up. Around this time I also so a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia and did testing for barrets esophagus with moderate damage due to GERD. I saw a neurologist (who has now left the state) and he guessed at Small Fiber Neuropathy but told me it presents incredibly unusual if that was the case. I opted not to do the skin test for it.

With some stomach issues still persisting, they did a CT scan and discovered a 5 mm ground glass nodule in my lungs by chance, and ""Several subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes"". There was concerned about the nodule and I am about to have some follow up lung scans.

Around this time, my doctor started to talk to me about psychosomatic symptoms. He offered me a few more tests and I came back with elevated c-reactive protein, 1:320 ana titer and a higher RNP Antibody score. Then all his talk about psychosomatic symptoms disappeared, lots of talk about MCTD came up, and he sent me to a rheumatologist who poked my arms a couple of times and then told me my doctor was over-reacting, told me to go back to a neurologist and told me I had fibromayalgia. This frustrated both me and my doctor as he said he referred me to her for help.

I prepared to tell my doctor to forget pursuing more dx at my last annual check up, and he must have sensed it coming because before I said anything, he told me not to give up, that there is something wrong, and that I need to see another rheum. Simultaneously he referred me out to get my legs fully x-rayed and sent me to a pulmanologist who has upgraded my asthma diagnoses to severe and uncontrolled. Now they're doing a breathing test for me soon, and an HDCT scan with talks about cancer or pulmonary hypertension which is next on the list of frightening things. In the last year I started having syncope episodes especially after donating blood, and I asked if it could be cardiovascular related. The ziopatch came back fine, and doc seems to think vessels aren't involved.

He's telling me not to give up, but this has been so much time, so much money and so many health scares. I'm exhausted and have been kind of thinking about just waiting for things to get worse so that the symptoms paint a clearer picture. My doctor is not on board with this. Recently a blood test showed my wbc was high, along with other immune system cells and I've become unusually anemic, so there were concerns about investigating blood cancers but I just can't do it anymore.

My kidneys and liver are healthy (but I do have mild non alcoholic fatty liver) I have chronically low vitamin D that we've been fighting to bring up, and I'm getting sick with common colds/stomach bugs every 2-3 weeks which also exacerbates my asthma leading to lots of nebulizer treatments and urgent care visits. Sometimes they scold me for not going to the ER for the asthma.


One final detail... around April 2020 during COVID lock down I went to the ER for menningitis like symptoms. Severe neck and head pain, and my neck arteries(nerves?) felt like they were on fire. Doctor confirmed I was sick with something based on blood tests, but spinal tap cleared me for menningitis and I was sent home. Everything feels like it started getting bad after this.

Would it really be unwise for me to sort of ""wait this out"" to see if symptoms become clearer? Are we missing some field of medicine? Do you think the second Rheumatologist is a good idea? I'm just tired and feeling like all the alarm bells are more stress than it's worth.",2024-11-12 21:03:23

I know PPIs are the general recommendation for mitigating GI issues, however I’m wondering if Misoprostol could be a reasonable alternative. The longterm effects of PPIs don’t look so appealing to me, and recent studies have indicated they are at least as harmful to the microbiome as antibiotics.

My Grandmother has recurrent flare-ups of fingertip swelling, redness, sensitivity, and pain. Now, the tips of several fingernails are discolored with blue/brown/green dots. This began a couple of years ago after a hangnail infection in one finger and having covid. She applied a topical antibiotic when she had the hangnail until the infection went away, but the redness later spread around her finger nail until all fingertips were affected on both hands through subsequent flare-ups. The symptoms come and go, but the pain and swelling gets so bad it makes it hard to comfortably touch anything. I have encouraged her to see a doctor, especially with the new spots on her nails. I’m concerned she has some sort of persistent infection. Thank you!

Normal height / weight 

POTS, M.E / CFS, hypothyroidism, PMDD, perimenopause 

I used to be a fitness instructor up until 2019 and was very fit and strong. 

Since then my health has nose dived to a point I struggle to walk some days and am extremely exhausted alot of the time and the doctors do not know why. 

My symotoms have improved marginally since being put on 25mcgs of levothyroxine as I have normal TSH but low T4 and very low T3. 

Around 2020 I started noticing that the morning after I did physical exercise I woke up feeling nauseous. It was hard physical excerise such as running or cycling. I did ask my cardiologist about it but he said it wasn't anything. 

Now, it is impossible for me to do anything close to that level of exercise and I am extremely sedentary but recently I have started doing floor yoga and am finding that I am feeling quite nauseous for about an hour after it and today I went horse riding for the first time in 6 years and I again felt very nauseous after I'd finished and fell asleep for about an hour. 

I have to stress that the yoga is extremely light, barely anything and also today, the horse riding was just half an hour and mainly walking with 2 very short bursts of trotting (I didn't feel I could manage any more than that). 

I just don't know what could be causing this nausea as the exercise is so incredibly light. 

I dont think it is blood sugar related. 

I am suffering an extremely traumatic break up currently and feel very very anxious all the time and cry alot so I am wondering if it is possibly a mental thing? 

I am also in perimenopause and experiencing a severe one.

I was investigated for adrenal insufficiency and diagnosed based on my symptoms but I've since had good cortisol results so that has been undiagnosed but there's still something in the back of my mind wondering if something odd is going on with my cortisol when I am active. But I do doubt it now as my last SST was very good. 

Could this be anxiety? It's so difficult when I am trying to be active for my mental and physical health but it just results in nausea and needing to sleep.

AskDocs,1gpu54a,Multiple small lumps under skin ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpu54a/multiple_small_lumps_under_skin/,2,"Hi there! Posting on behalf of my husband—M26, 5’9”, 180 lbs: 

About two weeks ago, he discovered a soft, pea-sized lump under his skin near the center of his chest; a couple days later, there were about 5 more in the same area. Went to a doctor soon after, who felt them and didn’t seem to think they were tumors, cysts, or lymph nodes, and later confirmed this with an ultrasound. The doctor thought that due to the location, it could be costochondritis and/or tietze syndrome, which we were told typically resolves on its own. 

In the time since, the chest lumps have started to shrink, but he has since found several lumps of similar size/shape in other parts of his body, namely around his armpits/pecs, his abs, and his upper leg near his groin. We are confused about why so many are appearing at once, and in so many different places. He isn’t dealing with any other symptoms and if anything has actually been feeling better and more active than usual lately. And due to a separate concern a few weeks ago, my husband had a full bloodwork panel, along with an xray and CT scan, all of which can back totally normal. You can’t see any lumps protruding from the surface of the skin, and there is no discoloration or odd texture above them; they are all soft and movable. 

Any ideas of what this could possibly be? Why are all these appearing all at once? We are wondering if it’s something like myofascial pain syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis, or some other inflamatory condition adjacent to costochondritis. My husband thinks the appearance of the lumps correspond to areas that he has recently stretched or excercise (for instance, lifting weights and exerting his pecs) but if so, what could be the cause of that? Are there other types of conditions we should be looking into? The uncertainty and strangeness of it all has left us not knowing where to begin. Hoping to get a referral to a specialist soon, but aren’t sure how long its going to take, and some opinions in the meantime would be really helpful.

Thank you! ",2024-11-12 20:10:28

So I’ve been avoiding blood tests since then since I haven’t been able to lose to weight, I’ve been busy with school. I know it’s bad, but I’m terrified of putting it on my record, especially at my young age most likely due to lifestyle.

I put some antibiotic ointment on it, thinking again it was from some sort of rubbing. Within a few days, it felt and looked better. But then after a few more days, the pain started again, and I found a lump. A few days after that, an open sore. And it is just happening over and over.

I have GAD with occasional panic and social anxiety. I use prozac. White female from Europe. 

I experience a lot of stress during certain meet-ups with health professionals. It can be the dentist (odontophobia too), OBGYN stuff or recently when I had a rectoscopy. Earlier this year I also had ultrasound of my breasts because of a lump.

In most of these situations I've had a male doctor. That makes it worse. What happens is, i get this overwhelming feeling of shame and embarrassment paired with my anxiety. I tell myself doctors do this/see this all the time, and so I've semi gotten over my ""I'm worried what they think of my body"".. But I find my biggest issue is the shame and embarrassment I feel regarding the anxiety and the way I then act during examinations or meets with doctors etc - like a scared child, like I'm overreacting or being dramatic.

The rectoscopy is the most recent examination I had done. Physically, not bad at all. Mentally, I'm going over the scenario in my head over and over, feeling ashamed that I was anxious. Like struggling to get my legs up properly because I was shaky, the doctor saying ""I don't wanna examine you if it's gonna feel traumatic for you"". He was literally just being nice, but I feel really stupid for acting so... Nervous. But the whole time I just wanna literally disappear. Yet I show up to these things so it's my own 'fault' really, I could have just not gone and made it more comfortable for myself, instead of ending up feeing like I'm getting flashbacks and can't sleep because I'm just playing it over in my head. 

I think I have some underlying bad experiences from a younger age that probably influenfes this. Not sexual assault, but situations with doctors/dentists or the like that have been maybe a little traumatic. My behaviour in these scenarios tend to be that I freeze up/just accept whatever is happening. Which is also why I feel really stupid, I'm all anxious and 'make a fuss' (just being nervous really) but then consent to everything and it's mooostly alright physically but I feel like I'd be better off just trying to hide the fact I'm anxious! 

My question is, because my mind is going wild...

- any tips as to how to deal with this type of shame around anxiety? 

- what DO doctors actually think when examining someone's most private parts like that, especially as a male doc to a female patient? It feels so uneasy for me. 

- is it better to try to hide being anxious/nervous? Both for me as the patient and for the doctor perhaps so they won't have to deal with anything other than their actual physical purpose/objective for the exam...

A few weeks ago I started feeling extremely hot while sleeping, even if my room is very cold and I have minimal layers on. The hot flashes come on suddenly (like I'll be cold/normal temperature and then suddenly very hot), and they can last hours or sometimes most of the night. 

During the episodes I also experience:

* Extremely dry mouth
* No sweating, just feeling hot 
* Fast heart rate 
* Feeling agitated or panicked (possibly due to fast heart rate?)
* Completely unable to sleep until it goes away, even if I make myself as cold as possible

As a result of this issue I am a complete zombie during the day, I'm getting like 3-4 hours of sleep per night even though I need around 8 to be functional. I don't experience this every night but I do have it most nights. I'd say it has been happening for around 3 to 4 weeks (it took me a while to figure out it was a medical issue and not just that my room was too warm).

Other relevant medical history:

* I had mono in September but I have been recovered since the end of September.
* In July and August I was tapering off my antidepressant (Sertraline) that I previously took for 7 years. When I got to a low dose I started experiencing irritability, so I stopped the taper and have been taking a consistent dose ever since (6.25 mg per day since early September). The hot flashes started when it had been over a month since I last adjusted my dose, so it seems unlikely that it is connected. 
* I also have taken 10 mg Vyvanse for the past 3 years, but my doctor suggested I wean myself off of it in case its contributing to my feelings of irritability, so for the past week I have been taking half a tablet (5 mg). The hot flashes started before I adjusted my Vyvanse dose, so it also seems unlikely that it is connected.
* Just under 2 weeks ago I got some blood tests done including Hemoglobin A1C, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Estradiol, and Testosterone, and all came back normal 

Does anyone have any ideas of what could be happening? I tried googling my symptoms and nothing came up. Everything I can find about feeling hot is related to menopause which I am definitely not experiencing. I just need some ideas for what tests to even ask for because I am losing my mind due to sleep deprivation. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-12 19:56:12

I had a minor op today under local anaesthetic to excise a lump on my shin. They think it's probably benign dermatofibroma but will do a biopsy. They couldn't fully close the wound with stitches so it's covered in Kaltostat, Inodine, and Mepilex, which I have to redo every 3 days.

They didn't mention it when I was in the hospital, but the information sheet says I should ""avoid activities like shopping, cycling, and dog walking or anything that will push up your blood pressure for a minimum of two weeks, or until the wound is fully healed.""

I'm pretty sure you'll just tell me to follow that advice, but what would happen if I went cycling or to the gym after, say, 7 days? Is the risk that the wound will bleed and take longer to heal due to the higher blood pressure (and skin movement)? I was hoping to do some mountain biking later this week or next week, and I normally lift weights in the gym every few days. I was also planning to install a solar panel on my van roof, which requires climbing a ladder and lifting a heavy panel, though I suppose that can wait.

Persistent burning/tingling sensation in right leg. Gets worse when driving...

As the title says, about 1 year ago I started experiencing a persistent tingling or burning in my right leg. Sometimes it feels like it ""pulses"" down from my stomach to my leg, it's kinda difficult to explain.

At the time the Dr prescribed Amytriptyline and said it was likely some kind of local nerve damage. This worked until about 2 weeks ago I missed a dose and it felt fine. I decided to stop taking it to see if maybe I didn't need it anymore. Bad idea, it came back worse than before and after doubling the dose (as suggested by Dr) its still not settled back down.

Besides the pain management issue it's weird because it seems to be made worse when I'm driving? Which doesn't make much sense. I sit all day for my work and it doesn't make any noticeable difference but getting in the car absolutely triggers it.

I'm starting to wonder if it's an anxiety driven thing, like when I'm stressed or nervous it seems to get worse. Not that I'm a particularly nervous driver but there seems to be a connection.

Any ideas?",2024-11-12 19:45:28

my whole life i have essentially never been able to run. even walking has always been incredibly difficult for me. i did do sports and musical in High-school, but it was torture. i did tennis and part of our warm up was that we would have to run around the tennis court (once) and i never could do it. i would always get about a quarter around and have to walk or even just stop. tennis courts are relatively small, so this was incredibly humiliating to be honest. i also struggle with “locking” muscles, if i put strain on my muscles they will stiffen up and lock in whatever position they were in. like for example, carrying groceries has always lead to my hands locking in a closed position.

My boyfriend is convinced something is really wrong with me, I’m unsure but he’s getting really worried so I thought I’d post and see what people think.

Background: 

F27, 161cm, around 60kg. In case it’s relevant, I recently hit my weight loss goal, was previously 86kg. Work out regularly and have been for years, even long before losing any weight. Even when I was technically obese I would have called myself fairly healthy, based on my RHR and VO2 max etc. Weirdly, both of these have actually gotten worse since losing weight- as has my heart rate variability according to my Fitbit. Still healthy, but not brilliant like they were before. Not sure if it’s relevant but I have a family history on both sides of breast/cervical cancers and my cousin has endometriosis. I have the hormonal coil, and am not on any other medication. 

Chronic symptoms: 

-before getting the coil my periods were always super irregular. They still are on the coil, but I’m aware at that’s a side effect of that

-when I do have periods they’re extremely painful, especially if it’s been a few months since my last one or if I’m under stress/in a new place

-some months I’ll have PMS symptoms and never end up bleeding. Usually when this happens a place that I think is my cervix randomly gets really painful, like stabbing pains? I always put this down to being some kind of weird coil side effect but I do always wonder if it’s possible the blood is getting like… trapped behind the coil somehow? 

-I’ve always had low blood pressure, even before I got into working out. My RHR was also pretty low even before I started working out- one of the weird things I’ve had since losing weight is it’s been above 60 for the first time in my life

-I get frequent migraines and headaches

-I regularly feel dizzy/faint but have never fainted

-I often feel nauseated with no clear cause

-I sleep way more than most people I know

-my vagina seems to be… small? Like I don’t have vaginismus, I thought I did but after talking to a doctor that doesn’t seem to be the problem. I just genuinely seem to be a little too small down there?

-when I was getting my coil switched out the nurse doing it commented that I seemed to be in a lot more pain than normal, she even said usually the removal part doesn’t usually hurt at all- that part hurt the most

-I have a lot of issues with my bladder that get worse when I’m cold or have PMS- like urgency, pain when urinating 

-I get pelvic pain when I’m cold 

Recent symptoms:

-I started to get PMS symptoms maybe three weeks ago, but my period never came and they’ve just kept going. This has happened before. I’ve also been in a new place and was sick at the start so I think my body may just be a little stressed

-for the past week I’ve had diarrhoea almost non stop. I’ve had it be induced by PMS symptoms before so I assumed it was that. The first two days were severe and since then it’s calmed down

-the diarrhoea actually stopped the day before yesterday but then I cried for ages about something dumb yesterday and it seems to have somehow… brought it back? Like I was genuinely feeling good for maybe a day and a half and then yesterday something set me off because I’m super sensitive from PMS symptoms and as I calmed down from crying I could feel the cramping that accompanies the diarrhoea returning

The symptoms relating to my bladder and pelvic pain have been investigated, but were basically dismissed as all being in my head. I accepted that for years but my boyfriend is pretty insistent something seems up

My last generalised blood test was in May and was fine. Had various additional tests since. None the wiser. Had lots of tests, no real conclusions drawn. (Brain MRI, Vertigo testing, General Blood Tests, FIT Test, Calprotectin test, H. Ploryi, Vitamin D, Gluten, Liver)

Currently take no medication, and have never consistently taken any medication. Have had 0 diagnoses.

I'm going to summarise a timeline of big events of health problems that I think may have contributed over the past 4 years.

\> Been a fairly consistent drinker (craft beers mainly) 6 odd cans a week since 2019 til Jan 2024 did two separate dry months in that time (see more later)  
\> COVID happened, don't think I ever had it, until 2023, but got 3 vaccinations (2 & a booster I believe)  
\> Started working from home during COVID and that has continued  
\> Close family member had an accident and almost died twice in 2021  
\> 2021 Silent Reflux caused Chronic sore throat  
\> Had bouts of not being able to sleep before travel/meet-ups with friends / any big occasion in 2021 / 2022  
\> March 2022 Brain Fog started 24/7 (still on-going, kinda feel like I'm disconnected / within a bubble, coordination not as good etc.)  
\> Stopped driving due to Brain Fog / only occasionally drive now  
\> Brain Fog kind of became an excuse for everything at first (as it kinda would, given I felt so weird & lightheaded)  
\> But after a couple of months I did not let it stop me from doing things with friends/drinking etc, everything beyond it was pretty normal apart from feeling very odd 24/7  
\> 2023 had constant burping & heartburn (February to June (ish)) Certain aspects of that have continued (burping, gas, wind)  
\> 2024 took Jan / decent part of Feb off drinking, when I started again I noticed 1 beer was enough to get me to where 2/3 would have before & made me feel bad the next day (70% of the time) - Drinking beer was perfectly fine before the fog and up until December 31st 2023 when I started the extended Dry January (but note I could never drink loads (4/5 pints of lager was my max forever previously)  
\> April 2024 to Present - Health anxiety concerns, hypnic jerks (now stopped), potential anxiety attacks twice (now stopped), stomach issues (lots of bubbling / noises & on / off constipation/ diarrhea) always had somewhere in the region of type 5 stool anyway.  
\> Spoke to doctors, anxiety could be the reason, unclear, but not completely convinced so I have not actioned.  
\> Anal fissure since August which didn't help general mood (misdiagnosed as Hemeroid twice) eating prunes / drinking prune juice has basically resolved that issue.  
\> September 2024 - BBQ w/ friends, had two beers and potentially bad but cooked Oyster, 3 hours later had bad nausea for 5 hours, stomach seemed to take 3 weeks to get anywhere near normal after that, had sensitivity to anything fizzy, beer etc. Anything like that would make my stomach feel like a battlefield / flare GERD overnight.

Example Recent Scenario - Foggy anyway, but had one 6.5% IPA on a Friday, felt a little tipsy nothing else adverse at that point (but like I say way more drunk / tipsy than in 2023 as an example), went to bed, woke up in the morning feeling like I slept about 4 hours, felt groggy, anxious, maybe even depressed, faint and foggier all day & super fatigued, then on Saturday I had nothing to drink bar a 0.5% non-alcoholic beer, went to bed at a reasonable time, woke up feeling exactly the same. Went for a drive and felt way better, felt somewhat better on the Monday.

**Narrowed down symptom list**  
\- Brain Fog  
\- Alcohol Intolerance (or sensitivity unsure) since February 2024 after 1.5 months ISH break  
\- Stomach issues (lots of noises, feels unsettled)  
\- Some GERD type symptoms (burping, occasional nausea, gas)  
\- Type 5 stool  
\- Anxiety ?  
\- Depression ?  
\- Fatigue

Brain fog is a big issue anyway, but the health anxiety, anxiety & the fissure have really battered me over the last 8 months or so, so I have been quite reserved/doing very little beyond a daily walk, which obviously will not have helped. I also treated beer drinking like a hobby of sorts trying lots of different stuff, so the fact that is almost off the table / not fun has also had a negative impact on me.

Looking for advice / some options.",2024-11-12 19:32:11

Sex: Male to Female Transwoman  
Height: Six foot Four Inches

Diagnosed with Crohns disease and ADHD, Crohns in remission for over 10 years.   
Medications: Vyvanse 60MG, HRT (Injectable Estrogen and another one I can't remember)   
Issue going on three days.

Last time she did her shot was last Thursday 

We had a bad cold/bronchitis ravage the household last week, we've all had lingering coughs, hers seems phlemmy but she's otherwise had no issues. 

Saturday she called me into her office and asked me to look at her hands, they were red, swollen and splotchy, she also complained of jaw pain and pain when swallowing. She took some ibuprofen and wanted to lay down, said she was drowsy. After an hour she said she was itchy all over, I looked and she had severe splotches all over her groin area, legs, under her arms, she said the pain and itch was immeasurable. I could hear her beginning to wheeze, she said her breathing was becoming difficult. We rushed her to the ER, they gave her Prednisone, Fluids,  Acetametaphine, and a nebulizer treatment. She left feeling better on her breathing, but pain was still a 4/10. 

They said she was ""tachy"" when she went in, but it had calmed down.  They did blood, x-ray, and an EKG and said nothing to note came up. There are no new soaps, detergents, foods, cleaners, or animals in the house, she hasn't traveled out of the country, she works from home and we see friends a few times a week and no one else has had any of these issues. she's had her covid vaccines but not flu this year. 

Today I go into the bedroom and she's not dressed, swaying, slurring her words. She's confused and exhausted, says there's pain. I called an ambulance because I couldn't get her down the stairs safely. The splotches on her hands look better, but she says her shoulders and back are on fire, she's wheezing but not as bad and the splotches on her groin are still bad. Ambulance takes her to a different ER and says she's tachy again. 

They give her IV benadryl, more predinisone, more nebulizer treatments, and another antihistamine she can't remember.

She says breathing is better, she's speaking coherently, no more slurring or confusion, pain is ""Only bad when I have to move a lot"". Her lactic acid is high, and they did a CT and are ""Concerned about blood clots in the lungs"".  They might keep her overnight but we're unsure. 

She never complains about pain, she hates doctors, this is not like her. I'm scared for my wife, please let me know if you have any ideas.

It looks like she has a very round head, which is unusual and could signal and issue with fusing of the cranial bones (craniosynostosis?).

But for the last 20 years, every single night he gets a pain in the abdomen. He goes to bed at 23hs, takes 2-3 hs to fall asleep, and every single day wakes up at 5am because of a sharp ​pain in the lower part of the abdomen. He also describes that he feels hot and the mouth feels dry.

  
Does not seem related to wether he drank water before bed or not, and doesn't seem related to wether bladder is too full or not when he wakes up.

  
He went to several doctors, but they couldn't find what the issue was. None of them were specialists nor did they know who to recommend him to, but the basic studies were done more than once and cancer was ruled out.

It affects his quality of sleep and quality of life, so he would really like to know what is the cause of this pain. Do any of you have even an inkling of an idea, or a starting point?",2024-11-12 19:06:13

Info:  Started about 10 months ago, occasionally accompanied by a cough. It happens about once a day but sometimes doesn't happen for a few days. Heavy activity does induce it, but sometimes it happens without doing anything.

\- Oxygen level is always 99, I can hold my breath for 2+ minutes, my blood work is good, I can run a mile, etc.

\* Went to my primary doctor for it, and he said my lungs sound good and that due to the mild nature of it, he's not concerned. He prescribed me albuterol and said it's likely mild asthma.

Well the albuterol DOES make it go away within a couple of minutes. But now im hitting the albuterol twice a day. If I don't hit the albuterol, it takes about 2 hours to clear on its own.

For 10 year experience sever constipation and nothing but laxatives has helped me. But I experienced sever problem with incontinence when I use laxatives. I asked my doctor if it would be okay to stop with my laxatives and if my constipation could cause my anal sphincter to become weaker. He said it’s okay and my anal sphincter would not be affected. Right know I don’t use laxatives and I’ve notice my anal sphincter getting weaker. I’m worried my constipation is the cause. (Can’t be because of anal sex since I haven’t hair it for years). I just want to know what you guys think because I’m thinking about trying to contact him again but I’m not sure if this is urgent enough or if this could waiting until my next appointment (which I don’t know when it will be, could be months). The only reason I’m worried is because I have a benign spinal cord tumor (L2-L3). Which is (probably, not confirmed yet tho) causing my problems with bladder and bowl (I also have other symptoms like saddle anaesthesia etc). And I’m scared my problems are permanent and won’t get better because I can’t do pelvic floor exercises or bio feedback. (I can’t control any muscle in the pelvic floor and I’ve tried both) I’ve read constipation can cause your anal sphincter to become weak but since my doctor said something else I’m not sure who I should trust.

Not a large amount but it initially lasted two days for coughing it up.This was the day I quit smoking cigarettes. I went to the er and have had many subsequent apps. They took 2 xrays that came back normal and I have also had a cat scan that came back normal. Since then I have had reoccuring symptoms of coughing blood. Very small amounts. Sometimes I run 10 mins and nothing happens. Sometimes I run and it makes me cough blood a bit. Sometimes I have small amounts of blood from doing no exercise at all which has recently stopped after my pulmonologist recommended antibiotics in the off chance it was bronchitis.i don't have any trouble breathing and am otherwise unaffected. I have no fever. No chills or any obvious symptoms. But today I felt good about it enough to try running again, I had stopped because it scared me so much I got anxiety before and after I ran everytime. I coughed up a even smaller amount afterwards and it is still a problem. Tho admittedly not as bad as it was before. I have many apps including a sleep study and a lung function test upcoming. They also want to put a camera in my lungs but I'm worried about that because they say it can collapse my lung. I have a ear nose and throat doctor I am currently trying to set up an appt with but as of yet have not heard back. Every dr I talk to has no idea what it could be.

***Picture to what it looks like currently:*** [***https://imgur.com/a/HkChy5V***](https://imgur.com/a/HkChy5V)

I haven't gotten myself tested yet, but am not experiencing any STD-related symptoms besides perhaps the occasional itch but this isn't like a constant thing and usually only lasts for a few minutes.

  
I don't really ejaculate regularly which I read can also be a reason, same with how it can be due to urine getting mixed in there with it too. 

  
I ejaculated today for the first time in probably 1 to 2 weeks, and noticed it almost was a little ''lumpier'' than usual as well on top of looking really yellow ish, being slightly worried about this I took a little brake and attempted again, which is what the pictures are. The lumps seem to be gone but it's still very yellow. I'm a 31 male with a pretty average diet, mostly fast food which probably doesn't help either but seeing as this has only been a recent thing and the fact that my diet has remained the same for years now I figured it might be an STD? Then again seeing as I only have 1 person I have sex with which is my wife for now 7 years soon I would almost want to rule that out too as in the years we've been together now my semen has always been gray, white ish. Is there a cause for concern? Thanks in advance

I (28m) recently had a tonsillectomy and for the first few days the recovery process seemed to go as expected. I was staying hydrated (water, Powerade, apple juice), eating sherbet, pudding, eventually trying mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. Taking the prescribed pain meds and Tylenol as needed. 
Then on day 5 (Sunday) early in the evening I get an intense stomach/abdomen pain worse than anything I’ve ever felt. I had my first bowel movement since the surgery, which was very painful and lasted probably an hour coming intermittently. After I was done the stomach pain did not stop, and subsequent bathroom stops led to me passing blood and nothing else (bright red blood in smallish amounts). After dealing with the pain through the night I went to an ER early Monday morning where they did blood tests and a ct scan and found nothing except some inflammation in the bowels. They sent me home with a prescribed antibiotic. I had the same feeling and kept passing blood all Monday. 
Today (Tuesday) the intense cramping pain has been replaced by a more tolerable uneasy feeling, and I am not passing blood but now have had watery yellow diarrhea multiple times, as well as possibly some anal leakage?
Question is, any clue on what could be going on in my stomach, will it pass or should I try to set up an appointment with my PCP? Any insight is appreciated. ",2024-11-12 18:19:57

Friday is a small church wedding and rehearsal dinner, and Saturday is a big ceremony and reception with 100+ people (including multiple people over the age of 85). 

I myself have multiple health issues, including lupus, hashimotos disease, sleep apnea, and a couple other fun things. 

Last Monday, I lost my voice and noticed my throat felt a bit sore. Over the next few days, I developed a really mucusy cough and post nasal drip. I get post nasal drip that lasts fews once or twice a year (for like 8 years now) and it's brutal. 

So basically, for the last week I've been up all night coughing. Constant mucus, very inconvenient and annoying. I'm on prednisone for the lupus so I don't feel sore or anything, but generally I'm not having a great time. My boyfriend didn't start showing any symptoms until this Saturday. Now he's in the thick of it and now getting any better. I'm on day three of antibiotics now because I went to urgent care (to get tested to make sure I was negative for covid/flu/strep) and I got diagnosed with bronchitis/walking pneumonia. I live in Northern Virginia and it's running crazy there right now. 

If I'm no longer showing any symptoms by Friday, can I go to the weddings? Will that have been enough time for me to no longer be contagious? 

And what about my boyfriend? Are we contagious after first symptoms or does it not work that way? Just frustrated and want to figure this out ASAP so I can let my brother know ",2024-11-12 18:18:32

Started with leaking serous/possibly csf drainage during inpatient- this was addressed by over sewing 2 sections. Swelling began after this and culminated with a 30mm bulge over craniotomy site, 6mm collection of subdural bleed under craniotomy. Always remained fluctuant, soft. But did have a few days of repeat leakage once home that eventually resolved. There was question whether it was just a hematoma/inflammatory process, or pseudomeningiocele. Decision was made to watch and wait. Swelling gradually reduced and skull/plate was prominently palpable. 
 My repeat CT 2w ago was when the swelling was gone, and was read as ""Right frontotemporal craniotomy changes are redemonstrated. The subgaleal postoperative fluid collection superficial to the craniotomy flap has significantly decreased in size from 9/20/2024. Thin dural based hyperdensity overlying the right frontal lobe convexity most likely reflects Surgicel or duraplasty changes (series 604 images 21-34).
Minimal hypodensity within the right frontal lobe cortex and subcortical white matter likely reflects chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is no suspicious acute infarct, mass effect, hemorrhage, or other extra-axial fluid collection.
Ventricular system is normal."" Surgeon agreed with read and told me to resume aspirin. 

My question is this- I've noticed that although the swelling was completely gone at one point, I now have it again. Very mild compared to before, but definite fluid collection. No leakage. I've had photophobia the past week and headaches when I'm upright too long. (Though migraines/headaches aren't uncommon for me, these are different). Surgeon is surgeoning 🙄 and not addressing the increased swelling or continued headache.

 Is it possible that whatever was leaking resolved but then started up again? I just want to know how much effort I need to put into getting this addressed or if I can let it go? 

(This is not a go to the ER issue. I'm a pro with neuro stuff at this point and know I'm stable from that standpoint so I have time to formulate a plan)

I have noticed lots of yellow post nasal drip and I’ve had a banging headache which has improved today. 

I don’t have any other symptoms, and I’ve read this could indicate strep which would require antibiotics. However, given I seem to be improving (however marginally) without any treatment, is this most likely viral? I’m assuming the temperature would still be present if it was bacterial. 

My 1 year old has been sick the last week so guessing it’s from him, but he had a runny nose and cough which I don’t. 

I’m just reluctant to battle GP surgery for an appointment, drag myself there with a baby, just to be told it’s viral. I remember similar streaks on my tonsils with previous illness, so not uncommon for me, but I usually had other symptoms too.

For 5 years ago I got tackled, then the day after I suffered extreme pulsating pain on what felt like was my scalp, got scanned and nothing showed up.   
Had severe troubles with this for a few years but the doctors just sent me to psychiatrists, because I was suffering from pretty strange psychological sensations.   
Then 3 years from now it felt like something popped near my temple, it felt like being drugged because a sudden haze and drunkenness fell over me, and since then I could feel my insides shift inside my head, the worst part is that I noticed I even had slight control over it, which was dreadful because I couldn't not control it, it was like my attention was brought to it and I couldn't relax it. 

My forehead felt like it was shifting downwards ever so slightly every now and then and I had to use my hands to drag it up. Meanwhile, inside my head near what felt like my temple I would feel like threads with meat latched onto them creating intense agony. 

Now a few years later, the problem is still not found on scans, the pain has died down but the overall area that's moving and that I can feel is even bigger, I can feel my scalp, mouth, cheek, and eyebrows moving together so I've never lost the sensation of my insides moving like it's detached and I still have very much control of the insides. 

Other symptoms include:  
A birthmark looking mark next to my left eye, stretching past the temple, though slightly downwards.  
Bleeding from skin around my nose.   
Taste of blood in my mouth.  
I can hear things rip apart, and intense pain near my ear when the loose parts push against that side, including tinnitus.   
Involuntary twitches around my eye and both sides of my chin.  
Loss of eye control and movement, sometimes they aren't both concentrated perfectly on the object I'm watching.   
I can't sleep without medicine because of stress, pain, inner movements sensations, and fear of accidentally breaking more stuff in there (I have slight control over it, which I wish I didn't have).

I've been trying to get help but most doctors listen for like 5 minutes and after they hear that it didn't show up on scan and that I've had contact with psychiatry, they just drop me and stop listening, and act noticeably disrespectful and ignorant.

Any idea what this could be and if that requires an in-person doc visit?

I currently take 20mg citilopram and have done for 8 years. I no longer think it is working due to the symptoms which I am experiencing. My doctor has given me 4 options to think about and do my research on. I would appreciate any guidance on the below options:

Carry on 20mg citilopram and take hydroxizine. My doctor said hydroxizine can help SSRIs work better

Increase citilopram dose to 30mg and see how I feel but I’ve done this in the past and it has given me bad side effects. 

Try a different SSRI, sertraline is the one that was suggested and see how I get on with that

I am on the waiting list for therapy but I’ve had CBT before for anxiety and it worked at the time but doesn’t help my depression.

Funnily enough in the past I have taken gabapentin for nerve pain and this is actually the best I’ve ever felt mentally but my doctor said they can’t prescribe it for low mood or depression which is a shame.

The only medication I take is Loryna (birth control).

Sunday (10/27) | started feeling pain in my lower right abdomen, it was mild constantly but I would get sudden sharp pains the following two days. I decided on Tuesday (10/29) to go to the ER because I assumed it was my appendix. After blood work, urinalysis, and a CT scan nothing was found. They decided to do an ultrasound to see if I had an ovarian cyst, I did not. I was sent home with the diagnosis of ""pain"". 

I went home and watched myself get worse and worse each day. Friday (11/1) | started feeling extremely weak and dizzy, and my pain is now more upper right abdomen and my back. I decided to schedule an acute visit with my primary doctor for Monday (11/4). She did an Xray to see if it was walking pneumonia and another urinalysis and blood work to see if it was a UTI. My urinalysis and blood work was similar to how it was at my ER visit, high WBC, high ketones, and bacteria in my urinalysis while my bloodwork was normal besides my AST, which was 47 U/L. She told me I did not have a UTI or pneumonia. I had told my doctor that my bowel movements were normal, but she decided to prescribe my Bentyl to ""help."" I have been taking the Bentyl since and still see/saw no difference.

I messaged my PCP and she said if the pain and dizziness is still present, to go to the ER. So, on Thursday (11/7) I went to the ER. At this point, my pain is starting to show on my left side as well. (She said I did have a positive Murphy signs?) I was diagnosed with a UTI and given antibiotics. I have been taking the antibiotics for 5 days and still see no difference. Should I give the medication more time or go back?

This lasted from February to November without a break.  I suspected blood sugar, but my doctor said my levels were alright.  He sent me for multiple tests centered around heart and pulmonary (edit: sorry, not pulmonary.  They did a stress test.  So artery stuff).  No problems found.

So after Halloween, I picked up a bag of Reese's candies because they were on sale. That was a Friday.  The following Monday I was my old self again.  Could that just be a coincidence?

Around the same time, I also started drinking less alcohol, which may have also been a factor.

The big mystery about this is that it all started in a single day.  I was fine one morning, then by the end of the day I could barely function, and I didn't get any relief until nine months later.  I wouldn't dare even take a walk, for fear I might not make it.  And now I'm suddenly fine.

The next day I went to buy loratadine, a couple hours later it went away and it didn't happen again for the rest of the trip. After that day, at least one every two weeks my nose will go through the same process again. The only thing that helps is a dexamethasone shot. I went to an allergist. He said I was allergic to everything (literally, even foods I've never had a reaction to), minus dogs (I have one). I've been on inmunotherapy for almost a year now it's not getting any better at all (nor worst btw). My nose is constantly at least a bit blocked, and same as before, once every 2/3 weeks it's completely blocked again. 

I'm tired, I haven't been able to properly breathe since then. I've gone back to allergist but he insists to just stick to treatment which I have done but it's not helping at all. Please tell me there could be another reason to this. Even if it needs a surgery. I can't deal with this anymore.

Inspired by this, I’m thinking of adding a) raw turmeric (1 tbsp or so) along with b) 1tbsp of ginger and perhaps c) a half raw onion to my salads. 


My concern is that all of these foods have anticoagulant properties. 


If I’m in reasonably normal health, would eating all of these foods on a daily basis lead to health problems? Or just a tendency to bleed easily? Would there be a complication if I needed some sort of emergency surgery, e.g. after a car accident? Thanks!

I tried penetration without a condom a handful of times with my penis being very slightly in her vagina lasting a couple of seconds, and one “pump” full penetration lasting about 2/3 seconds.

I've had slowly worsening symptoms for about a decade.   At first I would wake up and my calves would be sore, like I had run stairs the night before.   Eventually I started feeling like I had a super strong pulse in a specific spot of my calves (at the top, just below the knee) but only right before going to bed.   Then it started happening in my hamstring area.   Those are the primary areas, but I also regularly get it in my back/chest, and my triceps and even my fingers.  It now also happens when I first wake up.

If I get up and move around the symptoms usually go away quickly.  They seem very tightly correlated to my body being ready for sleep.  Unfortunately doing so wakes me up, and the symptoms usually reoccur if I then try to relax and sleep.

These aren't the normal ""twitches"" that I expect everyone gets. I still get those occasionally and they feel entirely different.  These are slower and mostly in time with my pulse.   They're also very specifically located.  My whole calf doesn't react, just a tiny part.  The same with my hamstring.   It's almost like the muscle is primed for action and the pulse is triggering it.  The twitches are generally very small.   For a long time I thought it was just my pulse, not the muscle.  However when they're really bad my wife can feel them happening by touching my leg when I'm awake.

I don't actually move my limbs at all.  My wife has reported that very rarely I do when sleeping, but I'm not sure if that's actually this issue.  It might be dream related.

I've been googling for years trying to figure out what it could be.    Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) keep coming up, but they don't seem to match to me.   My primary care doc hasn't been much help.

Dx: Aspergers, ADHD combined type (via neuropsych), insomnia 


Meds: 
- Morning: Vyvanse 30mg
- Night: Melatonin 3mg (prescribed - high doses in my country are rx only), Magnesium Glycinate (supplement), Amitriptyline 25 or 50mg PRN

Other: Cigarette smoker, no alcohol, no marijuana 

I have long-standing issues with having trouble falling asleep at a regular hour due to anxiety. Both before and after I started taking ADHD medication. Once I fall asleep I usually sleep well, but if I'm reaöly stressed I'll spend the night having nightmares and never falling into a deep sleep. 

Taking the melatonin and the magnesium every evening help when I'm not under too much stress, but sometimes after several nights of bad sleep I will take the amitriptyline to make sure I get a good night's sleep. 

My question is, how often can I take it without reducing the effect? I'm under the care of a different doctor than the psychiatrist who initially prescribed the amitriptyline, and he doesn't have experience using it this way (he's a GP). I try to use it less than once a week, but I'd like to know roughly the maximum I could do so on a bad sleep week (ie can I take it 3x a week non-consecutively?)

I am a 6ft, 25M, 115lbs, white male from Sweden, I do not drink or smoke or do drugs, no current medications.

I have had a colonoscopy done due to bottom left sided abdomen pain and blood in stools, the colonoscopy was without remark, except some surface-level sores on the ileum. The blood is most likely from constipation and not from an internal bleeding in the bowel. The abdominal pain persisted on and off for about a year and a half, but is now gone after the colonoscopy, I believe the stress of having undiagnosed GI pain might have made the abdominal pain worse, and now that the colonoscopy was clear of anything malignant the stress is gone, which also made the symptoms go away.

I recently had a checkup with the doctor to speak about treatment for the suspected Crohn's, which I have no more symptoms of (the only GI symptom I still have is constipation), where the doctor suggested they should start me on biological medicine. My all time highest calprotectin was just under 250 mg/kg, and that was at the peak of my symptoms.

I strongly feel like immunosupressing drugs are an overreaction, due to me not having any symptoms at the moment, and having lived my entire life with at most very mild symptoms, this coupled with my only slightly elevated calprotectin compared to other Crohn's patients.

Is this a common desicion for doctors to make for newly diagnosed Crohn's patients? Since my calprotectin always has been in the lower range of Crohn's, even when supposedly flaring up, would something like biological medicine be worth the risk, or even be something to be considered at all? Is it safe to go with untreated Crohn's as long as I am symptom free? The GI doctors have told me to come back if any symptoms occur, since I declined the biological medicine, was this a bad desicion?",2024-11-12 16:39:48

I am experiencing the following symptoms as a 34 year old male:

* Heavy headedness and nausea (worse in the morning)
* Feeling of being hot or cold with clammy hands (but no fever)
* Visual issues and feeling of light being flashed in my eyes at all times, even in the dark
* Inability to focus and constantly in a dazed state of mind
* Dizzy when I stand up
* Loss of 10-15lbs (I'm skinny)
* Weakness and occasional tingling sensations in the body

These are issues that have been non-stop for the last week or two though some can come and go. Particularly the vision which is most worrisome and constant. In the past few months I've had short stints of these symptoms which have come and gone but now they are all basically permanent. I would also mention in the past week I've had started to ""feel"" my gallbladder for the first time pulsating or being ""squeezed"" with mild shooting pains. Nothing too bad though. My HIDA scan a month ago was 23% EF.

My bloodwork is healthy and a brain CT scan was clear as well. Optometrist said my eyes look good other than slight blurred 20/20 vision. Colonoscopy and endoscopy mostly clear other than hiatus hernia. All these in the past month. I've had an ultrasound and MRI about 3-5 years ago of my stomach and back which came back clear. At the moment, the only evidence of health issues is that my gallbladder is not functioning well but doctors say my symptoms do not relate to the gallbladder. I booked a surgery for gallbladder removal but it is a month away at best. I am hoping that will resolve this but I am worried there are underlying issues potentially neurologically related.

Can anyone suggest theories or next steps to take? Thank you for your time. Anything helps.",2024-11-12 16:35:47

Hi guys,

28 years old, male, 173 cm tall, 68 kilograms and I have a weird blister on my private parts.

I'm very ashamed to have to post this here and ask fro your opinions, but I am kind of conflicted about this. A few days ago I noticed as blister like formation on the inner side of my foreskin. I am uncircumcised. It's not painful, it doesn't look inflamed as well. Looks like it's filled with some liquid and it is soft. Reminds me of a blister you get when you burn yourself.

About the STD thing - can't be, I haven't had unprotected sex, haven't had any penetrative experience for a while.

I noticed it randomly and it only gets little sensitive if I touch it a whole lot lol. I'm just wondering what is it. Tried Google, chat got, have looked at a lot of dicks but nothing I found looks like this one...

Yeah, I know, go to doctor...I don't want to if this can go away in its own. 

I had an idea to drain it with a syringe and a needle, but I am kind of hesitant due to the possibility of introducing bacteria.

Let me know what you think.

I have a very weird issue that causes really deep pain when pressure is applied to my body. Example: I scratch my back with my shirt on and I get SEVERE pain that lasts up to 30 seconds. It's like touching a bruise, except the pain is really deep. I don't have this pain from light touch or anything like that, just pressure. So if I just lightly scratch myself with my fingernails, I don't feel anything. But if I apply any amount of pressure, then I get the pain. If my cat stands on my leg (which he loves to do), I have excruciating pain. My sensitive areas are my back, arms, and legs.

i tried some tricks from the internet to try to unblock or “pop” my ear like swallowing while holding my nose, burping, yawning, chewing gum. all of that did nothing. the only thing that kind of did something was burping. when i burp (only the big burps though) my right ear has this sharp pain for less than a second. the only thing i haven’t tried is sneezing, i tried inducing it but so far nothing.

i didn’t go to the doctor because i admit i thought it would go away the next day. sunday rolls around and this time. there’s random bits a pain in my right ear. it’s not too painful or anything just random small tiny bits of pain that last less than a second. i don’t go to the doctor on sunday because i was busy and tbh i still thought it wasn’t a big deal. monday comes and i’m shocked that my hearing is still completely the same as it was on saturday. i start getting worried so that’s when i decided that i should definitely check this with a doctor.

it’s tuesday morning, it’s been 3 days and i seriously don’t know what this is. i’m going to go to the walk-in clinic today and see what they say, but tbh this is so so weird, i just woke up deaf this is so strange. nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

if you have any knowledge on this please let me know.

Hello,

I want to open up and say I have health anxiety so I appreciate the views of my illnesses are probably very skewed as they are masked by anxiety.

Anyway, I've been dealing with a cold that came yesterday. I've been feeling awful and have been resting all day today. However, I cannot stop worrying about my fast heart rate. I appreciate anxiety will be a cause and also I have a temperature of 38 degrees so that may be contributing. But I'm scared of cardiac events. I've had a few ekg in the past that have all been ok except for sinus tachycardia due to anxiety.

My main concern comes from checking my vitals with a pulse oximeter and noticing that my resting heart rate has been about 100 all day!! Also the spo2 wave keeps me worried too. I don't know what is the exact point of this post. I guess, is it normal for my heart rate to be so high even though I'm resting? Also are the waves for spo2 something to be concerned about?",2024-11-12 15:51:03

AskDocs,1gpj28m,Painful Ejaculation with Pressure During Ejactulation,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpj28m/painful_ejaculation_with_pressure_during/,1,"Hey all,

First the important info - 22 YO (years old) male, 85 kilos, STI/D clean, last sexually active 9 months ago. My symptoms are:

I've been having pain in the area of my testicles and lower abdomen during ejaculation. The testicular pain can be described as ""painful tension"" and the one in the lower abdomen (around the prostate) as a slightly burning sensation with pressure. There is also some burning feeling and it's hard to pee after ejaculation.

I did bloodwork and checked the PSA - all good, the CRP - all good, and did Sterile Urine test - nothing found.

I went to a urologist last week and he examined me and did an ultrasound and said everything seemed alright except for a slightly enlarged prostate (a bit longer than normal, from what I understood?).

His prognosis was Prostatitis and told me to redo the Sterile Urine test and also do an ejaculate analysis/test.

Today I was taking the ejaculate and noticed that during it there was a very bad pressure and slight pain coming from my lower abdomen DURING the ejaculation. The best for me to describe the feeling is like you squees a hoes and the water can't come out easy. Additionally, the ejaculation began with colorless liquid and then the cum which was ""clumpy"". There was not a lot of it (for not masturbating for 4 days) and it was not ""spraying"" as much but when coming out and it was more like dripping out/coming out.

My next visit to the Uro is in 10 days, so I am a bit concerned as the pressure and slowly dripping clumpy cum is somehow new and I did not mention it before.

Does anyone think I should be concerned and that it could be something more sinister than prostatitis? Or maybe something I can mention to my Uro next time as an idea?

I really appreciate any help you can provide!

I am very concerned and Google isn't helping :D",2024-11-12 11:58:23

I’ve suddenly started having issues sleeping longer than 4-6 hours when I’d normally hit 7 or more. I work the afternoon/evenings, get off at 10:30 and normally go to bed around 3 in the morning or so. That hasn’t necessarily been the issue as I’ve been on this shift for two months and haven’t had problems up to now.

I should say I’ve recently started taking a magnesium glycinate supplement to help with my mood and such, but didn’t realize it’s about 150 mg above the recommended standard dose for an adult.

Can that cause the insomnia symptoms I’m experiencing?

The second day it was brown and not painful at all. 
 Day three, I ended up taking a longer shower than usual and I guess it really softened/moisturized that burnt patch of skin, because when I went to towel off, I accidentally pulled some of the burnt skin off with my unintentionally aggressive towel drying. 😅

It’s red/pink and raw. It looks like the inside of a rare steak. I’ve been keeping it covered with a non stick gauze pad and some medical tape but it STINGS and the fact that it’s so…. “open”, makes me really worry about infection.

I have always been tall and extremely skinny, even as a child people would make comments about my weight. The heaviest I've ever been was when I weighed 54kg. I am diagnosed with POTs, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder and have received countless blood tests as well as many other tests which have all come back looking normal.

I'm not on any medications currently but I did stop taking birth control a few months ago. I did used to smoke cigarettes and vape but never consistently and I was never really addicted to it. I am not a heavy drinker, I probably have a few cocktails whenever there is an event or a party (which is rare) and I have never used drugs.

No matter what I do I can't seem to gain weight. I used to try very hard to eat 3000 calories a day but I didn't notice a difference and felt miserable having to constantly count calories and feel anxiety about whether or not I reached the daily goal so I stopped and just started eating whatever I felt like and not forcing myself to eat more. I would say I have minimum 1600 calories a day now. My main issue is the fact that whenever I eat I feel extremely sleepy and exhausted like I can barely keep my eyes open and forcing myself to keep eating makes me feel nauseous and I am barely able to force myself to swallow. When I go out to eat with my boyfriend he always has to finish my meal because by the time I am halfway through with it I feel exhausted and miserable. I don't know what's wrong with me and it really makes me feel bad about myself because people make assumptions about me based off of my weight and I feel like people are always monitoring how much I eat and commenting on it. I want to eat more, I want to gain weight, I want to have the perfect body for my boyfriend because I know he prefers ""thicc"" girls, but its just so incredibly hard and I am unsure if it is normal to struggle this much.

I (19F, British) have been suffering from recurring ear pain for as long as I can remember, which has been worsening rapidly in the past few months. There will be times where I'm completely pain free, and other times where I can do nothing but sit and cry.  
Originally, I would only feel a slight uncomfortable feeling towards the back of my throat/inside my ears, which has turned into an almost stabbing pain throughout my ear, hurting all the way from the ear canal to my throat.  
Recently I've started to have periods of muffled hearing and painful noise sensitivity, causing me to have to wear headphones in my lectures (I'm a university student) to block out sound. This means I'm starting to fall behind in my classes. I also suffer from tinnitus, for which I've seen an audiologist in September, who believes it may be linked to my pain, as the tinnitus has gotten louder and more apparent as the other symptoms worsened.

I did some research into Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, which until my appointment today I believed to be the most likely cause, however my doctor said that my eardrums would have been cloudy or bulging, which it isn't. In fact, I've been told that my ears are the clearest they've seen, and that there are no visual clues as to why I'm feeling pain.

I've tried taking over the counter decongestants (at a pharmacist's suggestion) which made no difference and I've also tried EarCalm Spray (Acetic Acid, instructed by my doctor), which also made no difference, but gave me the added bonus of constant pain and dizziness from having fluid in my ear. Painkillers (paracetamol, ibuprofen etc) have no effect on my pain.

I'm on a waiting list to see a ENT specialist, but I have no idea when that will be. I have to take a year abroad for my degree starting in August, so I'm not sure if I'll even be in the country to see the specialist when they are available, which is why I've come to ask for any suggestions as to what this pain could be?

So I got COVID for the first time last year in November and while it sucked, it only last about a week or so. The only thing is now I have this permanent cough that will not go away fully. 

Sometimes it's a dry cough and other times I have some mucus come up. It's like this itch in the back of my throat that makes me cough. I can breathe fine but sometimes if I take a deep breath I can hear what sounds like wheezing or a high pitch noise from my throat area. 

I have talked to 3 docs and they all kinda say the same thing: this is a known thing for post covid patients, it has to do with it weakening your lungs and making them more susceptible to Inflammation that comes with allergies and pollution. 

They have given me steroids you Inhale and honestly it has helped immensely but I can't keep taking those long term or more like I don't want to have take them long term. 

Some days I'm normal and have no issues then other days I'm coughing like crazy. Has anyone had any experience like this or have advise for me?",2024-11-12 14:27:45

No medication taken.

Non smoker.

No outbreak in any location, but exposed 5 weeks ago.

Hi all, so I had sex with a girl 5 weeks ago who I then come to learn has herpes, she didn't disclose to me I just so happened to see a packet of anti viral medication in her drawer. So I questioned her on it and she confirmed she has herpes.

Since then I have had absolutely no symptoms what so ever and definitely no outbreaks. Although I know symptoms and outbreaks don't appear 100% of the time. 

So basically I would just like some opinions on the matter, I'm mainly just wondering on if there's a high risk of infection after one sexual encounter while she wasn't having an outbreak?

I've spoken to some people on posts and through chat, quite a few have said that I'm very likely not to have caught it and I shouldn't worry. Maybe I should just try and ease my mind, I guess I'm just looking for more opinions from a doctor.

Thanks.

If you don’t know what BPC 167 is, it is a peptide that is believed to accelerate injury recovery but its still pretty experimental. I don’t love the idea of taking experimental treatments either but I am trying whatever I can to avoid surgery. 

I started using it last week on Tuesday when I got the nasal spray from a PT general health place. They recommend 2 sprays in each nostril twice a day; I only started with 2 sprays each nostril once a day to play it safe. The next morning I noticed I had a sore throat, and continued only doing once a day. Then comes Thursday, and I have to go out of town for a wedding and the spray is supposed to be refrigerated, so I decided to leave it home. After 4 sprays that morning, I did not return to taking it until Sunday night. Over the weekend, I forgot about the sore throat and it had gone away. Then, Monday morning, sore throat is back. I did a full twice a day dose Monday and now this morning my throat is feeling pretty shit. 

It might be placebo but I do want to keep taking it because it does seem to make my shoulder feel better, even after a few days. However, I know I should stop to try and connect the dots, so I think im going to stop taking it and see what happens and make sure its not just something else in my house causing it. I also was planning on getting a strep test done, I used to get strep all the time and this feels pretty similar. What do you guys think about this whole situation?

Now, a few days later, I still don’t feel better—if anything, I feel worse. My cough has become productive, and my chest pain when I cough is excruciating. I can take deep breaths without wheezing most of the time, but my cough is very painful and sounds ""crunchy,"" if you know what I mean.

AskDocs,1gplf2g,Prostap injections for adenomyosis?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gplf2g/prostap_injections_for_adenomyosis/,1,"Hi all, looking for a bit of advice. 

I’m 34F and have experienced menstrual problems (dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia with big clots) for as long as I can remember. They have really ramped up in the past couple of years. 

I was admitted into hospital twice last year for intermittent ovarian torsion due to a 8cm simple cyst. The cyst ruptured, but I was still experiencing increased pelvic pain so in was referred to gynae. 

I’ve had multiple TV USS, a pelvic MRI and a diagnostic laparoscopy. 

Pelvic MRI demonstrated findings in-line with adenomyosis, but also non-specific pelvic adhesions from my cervix, extending to my rectum. I have never been pregnant, had an STI or abdominal surgery. 

Laparoscopy confirmed adenomyosis, with a large bulky uterus. I was advised they were unable to see the adhesions on the laparoscopy. Question here… Would they be able to see the adhesions when the lap focuses on outside the uterus? 

Anyway, I’ve been advised the next course of action would be to try Prostap injections to slow the progression and help relieve some of the symptoms. 

My main issues are 
1. Chronic pelvic pain, much worse with menstruation. Totally life impacting, unable to do daily tasks etc when bleeding. 
2. Erratic periods anywhere from a 10 day to 6 week bleed, associated low iron, RBC and hematocrit with prolonged bleeds 
3. How heavy the bleeding is

My understanding is I would have to take oestrogen at the same time and this is only for a maximum of 2 years and my consultant advised this is just bridging the gap before I would have to have a hysterectomy anyway. 

Questions 
1. Is it simple balancing the prostap and oestrogen doses? Or is there a bit of dose titration needed for the oestrogen?
2. What’s the risk (apart from obvious surgical risks) vs benefit from skipping this whole prostap thing and just going ahead with a hysterectomy?
3. Would the pelvic laparoscopy identified the cervix-rectum adhesions?
4. Is there any other avenues? - I have already been on high dose oral progesterone with not much improvement in symptoms 
5. Realistically, will the prostap help?

AskDocs,1gpl6nj,Help me interpret this MRI scan,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpl6nj/help_me_interpret_this_mri_scan/,2,"I'm a 31yo male, highly active. Does impact sports and weight lifting 3-4 times a week minimum.

About 8 months ago, I had an injury during crossfit. Not particularly bad, mild pain in the right knee after doing squats. When I got back home I had clicking sounds and felt like something was dislocated when I was getting up the stairs. But it recovered immediately.

A few days later I was training as usual.

After about 3 months, I started noticing more discomfort and also clicking sounds in the knee when doing squats.

Fast forward another 3 months and the discomfort grew into slight chronic pain in the knee that worsened AFTER excercise, not during.
At this point I went to the doctor. He did x-ray and said I had leg length difference and arthritis in the knee. Wanted to inject HA. Also gave me special insoles to balance the LLD.

A month or so later I went to another doctor who did MRI and gave me these results: https://ibb.co/NY9sSKZ

He said I don't have arthritis and didn't give me any medication or surgery options. He recommended physiotherapy. If that's the case, I guess I should be able to ""self-treat"" it if someone can teach me the correct excercises.

 I'm not doing any high impact sports currently like running, but I obviously want to get back to my normal athletic life. I have slight pain all the time, like 2-3 out of 10, but more disturbing is the constant feeling that something is pressing on something in the knee. Like something is dislocated or not where it should. I don't have any functional issues or feelings of instability though.

Now the thing is I am abroad and because of the timing my insurance won't cover any further treatment or surgery here. 
I am wondering if I need to go back to my home country for this condition, or if I can wait another 4-5 months before seeing a doctor again? Full recovery is of course a priority over everything else, but if it can wait or I can self-treat it, that would be optimal.

I also have the full professional grade videos from the MRI scan, please DM me and I can send it to you.

Any input is appreciated!

They found a mass on my liver and wanted to do an MRI for further investigation. It turns out have 5 focal nodular hyperplasias and a hemangioma and mild fatty liver. All very small. The healthcare provider called me to tell me my results and said they wanted me to follow up in 6 months to monitor the tumors to make sure they hadn't grown but for now it wasn't much to be concerned about as most benign tumors don't change. It's also worth noting that the location of my abdominal pain was not near my liver so it was decided that it was unlikely the source of the pain. 

Fast forward 3 weeks and happened to be looking at my prescribing booklet for my hormonal Liletta lUD. Where it states do not use Liletta if you have short term (acute) liver disease or liver tumor. Now the healthcare provider knew had an lUD and made no conmment about it needing to be removed. But now I'm worried as it wasn't mentioned at all. did research and it seems like there isn't a verified link between liver tumors and IUDS and everything kept bringing up oral birth control.

where the vitamin deficiency part comes in, being the hypochondriac nerd i am, i'm unfortunately constantly on google and many times it seems my symptoms all align with different kinds of deficiencies, which makes sense. i do take multi vitamin supplements at times but where my downfall with that is, is that i tend to convince myself they're mostly placebo lol (cause how are these gummies gonna help me hh) 
i assume the doctor could probably offer something more effective (what that would be idk) but part of me wonders what if everything were to come back normal? (i'd find that highly unlikely but still) like am i just destined to feel this way forever then for no reason? idk 
sorry if this went off track a bit, it's been months of suffering through these feelings alone and i feel totally at a loss

edit: it would've probably been helpful if i originally added some symptoms but here we are: aside from the increased anxiety, some notable things would be heart palpitations, loss of appetite (i assume due to my nervous system being a mess) but moreso nausea rather than being ""not hungry"", i'm quite pale nowadays anyway but i often get told i look grey even, body temperature also the second i get a little overwhelmed i get so warm but then i always have people say my hands are freezing so idk. also i just have a general lack of energy or interest in anything, this is probably partly to do with mental health also, but i'm so withdrawn. even if there's things i enjoy doing i just.. dont? i used to enjoy being active and having hobbies but most days i have no will to do anything. and im not necessarily tired, just stuck. hopefully this adds a bit more context ",2024-11-12 13:32:14

AskDocs,1gpgrmy,Seeking NON-CANCER Prognosis - IN/IL,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpgrmy/seeking_noncancer_prognosis_inil/,1,"Hello. I am 39F, 5'4, 162lbs

I have been searching for more than a year for a Palliative Care, Internal Medicine, or Functional/Integrative Physician (MD or DO) for assistance with managing my extremely complex medical history with several severe chronic/life limiting illnesses and honestly discuss prognosis in relation to them. 

I've been hospitalized (4 or more days) at least 22 times in the past 4 years. I've had 12 bactremia infections (CLABSI) and gone into septic shock twice in the past 2 years, and have frequent, serious falls (2-3 per week).

Doctors either refuse to assume my care, stating I am too complex, gaslighting me stating that my conditions are ""all in my head"", dismiss me stating that I'm too young to have so many things wrong with me, or refer me in circles to other physicians that can't help. Others blatantly lie to my face but tend to change their tune when they figure out that I'm a nurse. The health disparities run so deep that self-advocation is always interpreted/charted as non-compliance, combative, or difficult.

I know rendering a non-cancer prognosis of 12 months or less is difficult BUT my medical records show a documented, significant decline in my health. I know that I cannot continue to live like this with the recurrent falls, line infections, and relying only my TPN. The lack of transparency is doing a number on my mental health. 

I have come to terms with my poor health and I believe a terminal diagnosis, at this point in time, is appropriate. I'm not afraid of it. I don't plan on going into hospice but I would rather spend this time with my family and not traveling for hours to appointments with doctors who say they can't help or run me in circles hoping that I give up. Most of them don't even look at my medical records due to the sheer size of them. 17,000 pages account for the years 2018-2024. 

I have tried Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, John Hopkins, tertiary care hospitals, and have been turned away by over 30 internal medicine and palliative care physicians. My PCP refuses to do any kind of prognostication. My GI and pain doctor can't either because they can't render decisions for other specialty physicians that treat my other chronic conditions. I want it to come from a doctor who looks at my entire health history for a better understanding of what I am going through.
 

My chronic conditions are as follows:

1. Complete esophageal failure with stenosis (failed Nissen Fundoplication)

2. malnutrition

3. dumping syndrome

4. chronic TPN (total parenteral nutrition) use (18 hrs/day, 7 days/week) for the past 4 years via portacath

5. abnormal liver panel (elevated Alkaline Phosphatase)

6. anxiety

7. PTSD

8. depression

9. idiopathic urticaria

10. chronic pleuritic chest pain caused by severe left lung necrosis, lung nodules, & atelectasis (treated with Medtronics intrathecal morphine/dilaudid pain pump)

11. Hx of infected pain pump pocket requiring emergent, surgical removal

12. gastroparesis & gastritis

13. Malabsorption (renders the efficacy of any PO medications, regardless of dose, ineffective)

14. Chronic/recurrent port, (tunneled) central line, PICC, and midline blood infections (about 12 infections in the last 4 years that required hospitalization)

15. Recurring sepsis, bacteremia, and staph aureus infections (CLABSI)

16. Dysphagia

17. Involuntary weight loss of about 20-25 pounds

18. Chronic hematemesis

19. Septal infarct (February 2024)

20. Chronic fatigue syndrome

21. Vertigo with frequent falls

22. Daily, hands on assistance with at least 3 ADLs

23. Dental decay, tooth loss, infection, and erosion d/t chronic acidic emesis (requires 6 or more extractions with implants)

24. Dehydration

25. Long Covid

26. Intermittent +3 pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities 

27. Poor vascular access

28. Surgical Menopause

I can't continue navigating this on my own. Are there any physicians who would consider taking someone so complex on as a patient? I have exhausted almost all the doctors and hospitals in my area. Obtaining a prognosis would be beneficial to not only me but my family as well.",2024-11-12 09:14:39

",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpp3go/fracture_on_fingertip_from_accident/,6,"Male.  Late 30s and about 5'8.



About 3 months ago, I cut my left index finger really deep with a knife and there was a lot of bleeding. I did not go to urgent care. I used paper towels on it to put pressure to stop the bleeding. I washed it with soap and water for less than 10 seconds. I then just wrapped it with gauze and tape. The next day, I washed it with soap and water for a few seconds and then put manuka honey and gauze on it. I did this for over 1.5 months. The scab then fell off. I still had lot of sensitivity and numbness issues.



Well a few weeks later, I was at the supermarket and as I was picking up unopened toilet paper rolls from the shelves when grocery shopping, a lot of unopened toilet paper rolls fell on my hand really fast. I then noticed a bump right on the fingertip that is very noticeable. I didn't see a doctor and thought maybe it would go away. **This happened 7 weeks ago.**



Well it stayed the same. 3 weeks ago, I went to general doctor who saw it and said it isn't a fracture or broken bone but I wanted to get an xray and he recommended me a place for it. I then got xray and brought the xray to him the same day. He looked at it and said nothing broken and said to just let it heal or go to a dermatologist for a cortisone shot on the bump. The general doctor said it was scar tissue most likely.



Few days later, I got the xray report from the xray place that read this below. I didn't read this until last week as I thought there was nothing broken. I didn't bring this xray report to the general doctor as this report didn't come until a few days later.



**The presence of a fine radiolucent line with a longitudinal course with sclerotic margins without displacement formation of bone fragments is observed, the rest of the bone structrures of the wrist and hand without alterations; the normal degree of mineralization for their age. The articular relationships of the ulna and raidus, with the carpus, intrinsic carpus and with the metacarpals, as well as these with phalanges and interphalangeals without evidence of subluxation, misalignment and with respected juxtaarticular margins.**

**Soft tissue without thickening. Diagnostic impression: Image suggestive of longitudinal incomplete fracture in advanced consolidation process. It is suggested to compare with previous studies, rest without evidence of bone pathology by this study method.**



So does this mean I have a fracture then? The report I posted above... I didn't get it until a few days later but didn't check it until last week because the general doctor said there was nothing broken... but this report says otherwise? I had made an appointment to see a trauma/orthopedic doctor because of this. Longitudinal incomplete fracture is what I seem to have? I am very upset and frustrated now and do not know what to do. **The injury has been 7 weeks already.**



As long as I have the email with the images and report from the place I did the xray, I can show or send it to the orthopedic doctor and that is fine? The physical xray I got from the place got damaged.



First 3 pictures is how it looked after the unopened toilet paper rolls fell on my finger really fast that caused the thing on my fingertip. The last 2 photos is how it looked weeks before that. Notice the bump on the fingertip. It's extremely uncomfortable and feels like a bump but it seems to be a broken bone but not a complete fracture?",2024-11-12 16:44:50
AskDocs,1gpk4lv,IS this a dumb idea?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpk4lv/is_this_a_dumb_idea/,12,"For context: I'm a software Engineer and my very bad experience with cross border care and inter state care has put some considerations in my mind. 

My friend was flown from Brazil to the United States for an operation. Piecing together his medical history was chaos. We pieced together his scattered medical history (a process that took ages) revealing a complex interplay of conditions and even incomplete record. 

Is this also relative to the USA? Where Physicians contact a patients previous doctor to request patients scattered medical record? Is it a great idea to have an autonomous system that pulls patients record globally from various health silos to help physicians and of course with the patients consent without going through the ludicrous manual processes?

I've been exploring the concept of a autonomous network system for healthcare where:

1. Each node must agree to follow a set of principles and as a whole, will function optimally

2. The network self-organizes, self-functions, and self-governs. 

Goal: Optimize global healthcare through secure, authorized access to patient records, enabling physicians to:
1. Access patient history and medical data.
2. Conduct transactions (e.g., prescriptions, referrals).
3. Collaborate globally.

Just like what VISA and Mastercard has done in finance but now building the similar innovation in Healthcare. 

A Health authorization and transaction clearance connecting every health facility globally.

When so much of the conversation is centered around the safeguarding of data when it is shared between different parties, it is easy to forget that it is a privilege to share data full stop. To have systems that can speak to each other and facilitate the transfer of important health information that allows healthcare professionals to make informed recommendations for your care in everyday and emergency scenarios.",2024-11-12 12:58:40

The pharmacists where I am don't seem to want to help and I'm not sure where I can source this information for myself. 

Essentially I need to know if I can take medications at the same time, or which ones I need to spread out. 

The medications are prescribed by specialists etc, so there isn't really one who is overseeing everything. 

1. Vyvanse 70mg in the morning. 
2. Dexamphetamine 5mg, up to 9 per day. I typically take 3 x 5mg when I wake up with the vyvanse. (and the others twice more throughout the day). 

3. Levothyroxine 50mg

4. Candesartan cilextil 4mg. (taking in the morning when I brush my teeth). 

5. Slinda drospirenone 4mg (I just filled the script and need to start taking for perimenopause related issues-haven't been on hormone contraception for years otherwise). 

So it seems like a lot but I have narcolepsy and I can barely stay awake on the medication I am on now. 
The candesartan was prescribed three weeks ago by my specialist because of increasing high blood pressure. 

Levothyroxine is for Hashimotos, and I have been taking this for about four years. I find that because I am trying to space this medication out, I am forgetting to take it. Some days I am barely eating or leaving the bed so the more simple I can make my life the better. 

I expect as my medical conditions evolve, my medication will adjust and change. 

Is there a resource I could use to make sure I am taking my medication in a way that I can remember, and also doesn't conflict with each other?

Any advice on the medication that I currently take would be appreciated, and advice on where I can go for resources in the future would be amazing. 

Thank you so much.

My daughter has a daycare cold, nothing serious. Her pediatrician has given us the green light to do a saline nasal rinse 2x a day, which I honestly is easier and seems to work much better than saline drops and the nose Frida. She doesn’t like it, but it’s over really fast and is totally fine once we’re done. We’re using a nasal irrigation syringe, lukewarm distilled water, and the neilmed packets, and squirting 10ml of the solution on each side of her nose. I have her sit on the side of the sink, tilt her forward, and tilt her head to the side and usually it works just like it’s supposed to. Her mouth is open (she’s usually yelling during this process).

I have a question about how to do the nasal rinse when the nose is really blocked. This morning, on the first side, which is usually easier just because of which hand I’m holding her with versus which hand I am holding the syringe, I had a hard time getting the water to dispense. I thought it was because she was squirmy and I was maybe pushing the tip against the inside of her nose. But after a few seconds, a bunch of water came out her mouth instead of the other nostril.

I then did the other side. That time it worked like it should and pushed a ton of super thick mucus out the opposite nostril. I tried the first side again and that time it ran totally through like normal. I assume her nose was just really stopped up.

My question is: what should I do when her nose is really stopped up like that? Did I hurt her ears by doing the rinse anyways? Am I going to give her an ear infection? If the solution goes down the back of her throat, will it upset her stomach? Should I not have rinsed the first side a second time? Etc.",2024-11-12 12:55:46

As I'm considered high risk, I've had every covid vaccine and booster as soon as they are due. I had a reaction to the first shot - non painful hives, and then, for all jabs since, a fever kicks off like clockwork approx 30 hours after. I usually get the flu jab at the same time.

This is how I expected this booster to go. However, my doc suggested I also get the pneumonia vaccine as well. So flu and covid in each arm and pneumonia in hip.

As expected, I was fine until 30 hours after when the fever kicked in. That broke around 11pm and I went to bed, thinking the effects were done. However I woke up at 1am with a higher fever and terrible chills. I also had a very painful mark on the pneumonia site which was hot and I could barely have my trousers touching it.

The fever kept getting worse, intense headache and chills, nausea and couldn't eat. The fever peaked at 39.5 on Saturday and stayed relatively high until Sunday evening. I took paracetamol as often as allowed and it didn't seem to have any effect. I have never felt so sick and couldn't leave my room for 3 days.

I went to my GP yesterday as i was still feeling very unwell, with awful headaches and the jab mark was still getting bigger (the size of a brick at that stage).

She said I had an allergic reaction, prescribing antihistamines which immediately started bringing the swelling down. Though I'm still suffering with fatigue and very bad headaches. She did say that I don't have to get a pneumonia vaccine again until I'm 65.

My question is - I am generally more reactive to meds than normal people (if there is a listed side effect, I will get it 10x); was this fever completely due to the pneumonia vaccine or a combination with the covid vaccine? Should I be careful with any other vaccines?
And when should I expect the headache to go away 😅

Unfortunately, I don't know which brand of vaccines I had. Might be worth noting that I have also had a ton of other vaccines over the years (as a result of travelling to tropical countries) which had zero side effects

43F. Height: 5' 5"". Weight: 13.5 stone (BMI 31.1). Race: Causasian. Location: UK.

Primary complaint: Dull constant headache averaging 4/10 on the VAS (but can range anywhere from 2-8/10 on the VAS) above left eye (just above eyebrow). Each headache can last 5-10 days, averaging two a month. Ongoing since approximately 2020/2021.  Eyes tested in 2023, slight prescription change but optician said she didn't think this was the cause of the headaches (and new prescription has not relieved). No dental issues. Sleep does not relieve, nor does paracetamol, ibuprofen or naproxen. Amitriptyline (prescribed short course low dose taken at night) in 2020/2021 did relieve but also made me sleep far too heavily and excessively. No prescribed or over-the-counter medications or supplements taken aside from occasional paracetamol/ibuprofen during menstruation only (i.e. not medication overuse headache).

No known triggers or links to menstruation. Have removed/cut down on caffeine, cheese, chocolate and sugar with no effect. No illicit/recreational drugs, very minimal alcohol intake (\~8 units/month, not binged, that's across a month). Non cigarette smoker since 2015 but vapes nicotine. Diet okay, better over the last 18 months than it has been prior. Exercise (walking) regularly for 1-4 hours per day. I'd say natural light and fresh air does ease headache but not relieve. No unexplained weight loss, but weight gain has definitely been an issue over the last decade despite improved diet and exercise, I know I could do with further improvements there though).

PMH of migraines since childhood (none at all since \~2016) - these include nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and dizziness (new headache does not at all). Relieved by sleep, paracetamol, ibuprofen and cold flannel on head (these new headaches are not). Possibly perimenopausal. Iron deficiency in childhood and pregnancy. 3x uncomplicated PV deliveries (1999, 2000, 2003) plus ?unexplained secondary infertility (not investigated). HPV detected on smear in approx. 2013/2014 plus colposcopy. HPV clear on subsequent smear. Overdue smear test currently (I know, I know). No asthma or diabetes. No other known medical or surgical problems. No traumas (such as road traffic accidents, i.e. no whiplash injuries). No other significant PMH. No known allergies.

Improved sleep hygiene with no effect. No aura (or any sign a headache is about to come on/go away). Can wake me up at night. Go to bed with headache, wake up in morning with headache. Changed pillows with no effect.

Headaches originally started during a period of high stress (final year of university + high-stress court case of historical abuse - case has since ended and stress levels returned to normal with occasional flares of stress but I haven't seen much link between this and the headache since).

Family history: Mother 2x brain aneurisms; paternal uncle 1x brain aneurisms; father type 2 diabetes, glaucoma, colorectal cancer 2010; brother, maternal uncle and one son congenital nystagmus, maternal grandfather died aged 60 of ?heart attack.

Social history: Lives with husband & two dogs on a boat (accessing healthcare can be difficult hence this post) - headaches started pre-boat (and are unrelated to the wood-burning stove which has been serviced three times, we have carbon monoxide alarms and headaches ocur even in summer when stove not lit).

Employed full time in desk-based job (medical and medicolegal transcription funnily enough), but headaches ocur whether I am working or not. I do limit screen time outside of work.

I did speak to a GP over the phone when they first started who put it down to stress entirely and prescribed the amitriptyline (which I stopped taking in 2023) and they seemed unconcerned - bearing in mind they'll have had my full medical history in front of them as opposed to the abridged version above. I'm sort of at a loss with it now - unsure if I should find a GP to discuss with again or whether it'll just get chalked up as stress/hormones and told to go away and lose weight.

My health anxiety has been horrific recently and everything I can think of is leukemia. 
It was actually good for few days but then 2 days ago I started experiencing fever (ranging 37.0 to 37.6) without any other symptoms. It's not getting more than that but it's not getting less either. 
I'm for sure not sick as I don't have any cold or flu symptoms. 
Of course my dumb head dugged into the leukemia Reddit and sure enough people were describing that exactly low grade fever is the first symptom of leukemia. I lost it at this point. I'm sitting in my bed unable to breath or function because of a panic attack. 
Recently I also feel tired and off but not the type of tired to not be able to move I still can walk all day be at uni and everything but the whole time I just feel down and sad and depressed. 
This also contributed to the leukemia fear as I know fatigue is a common symptom. 
I sleep around 7 hours per night sometimes less and I wake up usually at least 1,2 times per night. In February I had blood test that showed I was vitamin d deficient and i only took medications for like 5 days (dumb I know) but then in the summer my doctor told me it should be fine again as I was getting plenty of sunshine.

It's really tricky and i had to resign from going on lectures or meeting with my friends after preparing myself and being ready, because my temperature suddenly grew a grade higher, even if in the morning i had checked the termometer and it showed me 36.6. 

Today it's been a week since i've got sick and i still have this flunctuating temperature. Three days ago i felt little scratching in my throat and i was coughing, but this coughing is not regular and happens usually late, in a bedtime for a short amount of time. The scratching lasts longer, isn't very painful, but it makes it harder to fall asleep.

I talked about it with my family and friends and there was a narrative, that this flunctuation of temperature and the lenght of this fever is concerning, especially since i was regularly drinking fervex and it didn't help. 
Right now i have a tension headache and fatigue, but i don't know if it's because of fever or my messed up sleeping schedule.

My family relative said, that i might have a psychogenic fever, because i worry too much about being healthy on time to not have any arrears in learning. Is this possible?

To be clear, i am 18(F), weighing 50 kg and 1,66 meter tall. I don't smoke, medicate myself with Citaxin for 2 years and slowly discontinue the medication, taking half a pill per day from July 2024.",2024-11-12 12:06:19

About ten days ago I experienced night sweats for 2/3 nights, I wouldn't say I was drenching wet but at least humid, especially in my stomach area. I was having stomach problems at the time, like stomachache and diarrhea, and I blamed the night sweats on it. It went away on its own until last night. This morning I woke up at around 5:45 am feeling like throwing up and I realized I hadn't digested well. I was scared to actually throw up so I massaged my stomach until I needed to use the bathroom, and it was diarrhea. After that I went back to bed and after 10/15 minutes I felt well enought to lay back down without feeling nauseous and fall back asleep. When I woke up again in morning though my PJs shirt was quite wet, maybe still not drenching but wet, more than how it was 10 days ago. Even my pants and sleeves were humid. I noticed it dried out quite quickly and I was left feeling very cold. I should also point out that I might be in my pre-period phase. I can't tell with absolute certainity because my period isn't super regular, sometimes it comes 2/3 days before or after the prior month, or even farther than that if there's a big switch in temperatures (like what happened this past week where I live) but I know my period should be close. I got night sweats once earlier this year while I was in my pre-period (I talked about it to my own doctor at the time and she said not to worry if the night sweats went away with my period, and they did). Of course, I'm going to talk to my doctor again if the night sweats keep going on for an extended period of time, but I'm an anxious person and I would like to know now if I have to worry for real. What's your opinion, can indigestion and/or the pre-period phase cause night sweats? And if you have any additional info or advice you think I should know about the matter, please tell me.

Grave's Disease, psoriasis, anxiety 

On Oct 8th I woke up with neck pain and weird tingling sensations going down my back. I was given flexeril which helped the first few days and then it no longer did.

A couple times it'll randomly get hard to speak and swallow. Like my face muscles are extremely slow.

It has only gotten worse. Burning and tingling sensations in my face, neck, tongue lips. Burning and wet sensations on my left arm. Neck, back, and chest pain that varies from manageable to debilitating. Triggers my sciatica as well, mostly left side. Tachycardia and palpitations. Eye pain, especially when looking left to right.

Flexeril helped for a week or so then stopped being effective. Same with tizanidine. I've been given toradol in the ER and it takes ~4-6 hours to even touch the pain. 

Doctor sent me to PT. PT said my issue was neurological and they couldn't do much. I had a neck CT and a neck XRAY that didnt show anything abnormal. VA doctor is sending in a brain CT sometime this week but I had an NP tell me that won't show anything.

Cardiologist gave me a 3 day heart monitor I just turned in and should have the results of Friday. My thyroid levels are normal and I'm getting a thyroidectomy in 3 weeks. I was actually able to come off my beta blocker completely in July because my elevated HR was back to normal. Then I started taking it again because it started getting high again once the neck pain started and my watch often alerts me that I'm in AFIB.

Nothing trauma related happened recently. I did have a couple repeated concussions in 2019-2020 that I was never treated for but idk if that would start causing issues now.

This has ruined my life. I had to drop out of school, quit my job, quit going to the gym because of the pain and sensations. I'm a disabled veteran and I am surviving off disability. They keep telling me it's a pinched nerve or just anxiety. I've dealt with anxiety since I was 8 years old and this is not anxiety.

I do not want to end my life but I understand people who do because of things like this. I'm at a loss. Something is not right with me and I don't know what more to do. I'm jumping through fucking hoops to try and see a neurologist but no one seems to think this is urgent.

The redness is only on the soles where my feet touch the ground, and along the sides of my feet, with a clear arch. I rubbed the bottom of my left foot a few days ago to see if I could spread it to the arch to rule out fungus for certain (someone in the household has foot fungus), and none of the redness has spread to the arch. The white streak leading to the purple nail on my left foot is about 1/2 cm wide, and goes from the inside edge diagonally to the side of the nail.

Sometimes the bottoms of my feet or outer toes feel slightly prickly since this all started…not exactly itchy, not exactly pain. It burns at night the worst. The first few days, the bottoms of my feet burned so badly I couldn’t sleep or walk, and then the burning stopped but the redness continued.

Back in June I was admitted to hospital with exhaustion and a few other symptoms. I originally went to the Dr because I was cold all the time, dropping weight was and so, SO tired. I work Monday-Friday 9am-5pm and at the time was sleeping from 6pm-8am every night. There was no time for anything other than sleep. Went to the GP about 12pm one Wednesday, and they ran routine blood tests and sent me on my way home with instruction to eat more and exercise a bit more to build up some muscle, plus an appointment for a dietician. 

At about 5pm I got a call from the Dr to advise me to go straight in to hospital. He said my hemoglobin was very low (4.7). He seemed really concerned and said that I should take an overnight bag as they'll definitely want to keep me in for one night. I ended up in for a week. In that time, I received 5 bags of blood and 2 iron infusions. They made me feel on top of the world! My hands and feet were warm in ways I have never experienced before (- it felt like they were warm from the inside for the first time ever!) and I was and am so incredibly grateful that I received those bags of treasure!

Since getting the final iron infusion I have had this bruise-looking mark on my arm, I think it's from where a couple of drops of Iron leaked from the bag and went under my skin...  but it now looks like a bruise. Does anyone know if this is a normal issue? Or if it's permanent even? As mentioned, it is a few months old at this stage so nothing really to worry too much about, just curiosity really!

For maybe about 4 years I have had a chronic non-allergic rhinitis. Its very watery and runny, and is triggered by eating (anything), cold, and possibly other things I cant quite put my finger on.

Now this in on its own isnt a weird diagnosis, ive just pegged it as a regular vasomotor rhinitis, however, i also have another strange phaenomenon. Specifically on the distal third and lateral right side of my nose, i also get VERY localized sweat. This happens whenever the runny nose happens too, so at the same time you can see small sweat droplets gather in this small localized area. This happens especially if my nose is cold, and nowhere else on my face.

Now i doubt there is anything one can do with this, but I have never heard of anything like it, never seen it, and I have no clue why it happens. Another vasomotoric error? Has anyone seen anything like it? 

In addition, does anyone happen to have any useful treatment options for the rhinitis itself? I have tried steroid spray, and atrovent nasal spray, but it makes no difference. ",2024-11-12 11:18:12

Hi!

First off just to note I am no longer driving due to how unsafe this has become. 

I just wanted to see if anyone had experienced anything similar as it is terrifying. I can be completely rested and today I had just finished a coffee and felt fine. Then it feels like I am so tired my eyes are going cross eyed, double vision and nothing I do (windows, radio, eating, speaking to people) will work to keep me awake. Only option is to pull over and I literally fall asleep/pass out immediately for 5-20 mins and can carry on? Or get out my car for 10 mins?

I can feel it coming on so I am able to pull over but it is not safe for me to drive even so. I am really upset/frustrated with myself as this takes away my freedom but it is the right thing to do.

I am on the list to see a sleep consultant and I do have an underactive thyroid which I take medication for and is in normal levels. My sleep routine is pretty standard 8 hours and I usually feel very rested! I have been told by my partner I sometimes do a weird clicking/sucking noise in my sleep and grind my teeth so I am hoping the sleep consultant can help and maybe that could be the cause.

Anyone had anything similar or any tips for avoiding this?

Two days ago I was on vacation in Las Vegas and was jumping on a trampoline at an attraction when I felt everything go out from underneath me. I do remember pretty vividly hearing something like wood breaking and the netting giving out underneath me (the trampoline was partially made of wood) but regardless of that both of my knees were injured pretty badly. I went to the ER, but didnt have time to talk through the results of the xray with the doctor as thoroughly as I would have liked partially because they were slammed, but also partially because my wife and I were trying to get on our flight to get back home where we would have more support in managing my injury. 

At the time of accident I was not able to weight bear at all nor was I able to move my legs at all however as of this morning I am able to stand up straight un-supported and move my legs in a somewhat walking motion with a lot of support. Range of motion has increased significantly since then too, though it is still significantly impaired. Compared to when I tore my patellar tendon, this is huge since it took weeks for me to get to this point last time, but I don't know how much of this is me being scared to take on more debt and how much of this is just an injury that needs time to heal, but doesn't need surgery. 

Attached in my link are pictures from the xray as well as the report from radiology. Can anyone with better knowledge of Orthopedics chime in? Also one thing in case this sticks out to anyone, yes my left patella was chipped before this injury. It wasnt present in my xray from my 2016 injury, however a few years later when I sprained my knee it showed up then (probably around 2018)

Asking for my dad
He takes medication for cholesterol and i’m not sure what else he takes but that’s the main thing

He has had a fair bit of wine tonight (it’s 9:45pm where I am) but that’s not uncommon - he has some wine most nights, not usually enough to get drunk but here and there (like tonight) he might have too much. 
Just now he bent down to pick something up and immediately lost power in his legs and couldn’t stand back up, we had to hoist him up (he couldn’t help at all). He was alert and awake the whole time this was happening, and could feel his legs, but just physically couldn’t stand up himself.

For the last week I have been getting random dull pain in the lower right of my stomach, maybe an inch across from belly button and an inch down but above the waistband. The pain I would describe as a hunger pain, it's not painful more of a dull ache. It would last maybe half a second and it goes, comes back randomly. Pain hasn't gotten worse or more frequent.

Is it possible that it may be my appendix going bad, I would go see a doctor but I'm working away for work at the moment and don't fly back for a week and would rather stay because I need the money.

I'm trying to seek some suggestions on what might be going on with me.. has been happening occasionally since I was about 10 weeks pregnant (now 21 weeks) and is a new problem.. I would post a diagram but unable to?.. ive been having a weird very sharp nervy spasm like pain, it happens at the right side of my left breast and shoots up into left side of neck and along my left collar bone, it comes on very suddenly and goes away within moments, it doesn't seem to be movement triggered but does sometimes happen when I'm anxious or I get like frightened, but is often when im at rest and someone just speaks to me 😐.. when it happens it scares me a lot because of how painful it feels, but i don't think its a deep pain and definitely feels more surface level and how I imagine a neuralgia or severe spasm to feel.. when it first started I went to AnE due to have hot sweats in the night with it too, ECG was clean at that time and they suspected costochondritis because I was so tender where I had the pains, I'm not so tender this time round though and would think it would hurt more on moving... any ideas what this could be? I think the doctors are going to be sick of me right now so don't want to keep bothering them... I do have current subclinical hyperthyroidism which had increased my palps so not sure if it's linked to that maybe.. any suggestions would be much appreciated, thank you in advance",2024-11-12 10:35:12

31F 5’1, 140, Caucasian, US

I’ve got small kids and picked up an upper respiratory virus from them (have received covid/flu vax). I have asthma which is well controlled with Singulair and Symbicort except for usually flaring up with URIs. I’ve been sick for about 6 days, with congestion at first and then for the last 3 days a very bad cough and headache. I’ve been coughing so much I lost my voice yesterday and since yesterday have been struggling with not being able to take full breaths. I had trouble taking my symbicort inhaler this morning due to not being able to take full breath so i booked an urgent care appt. I tell the dr all this. She listens to my lungs and says that “she can definitely hear it” and says that I’ve got bronchitis with an asthma exacerbation (not a shock to me). She prescribes me Bromfed Dm, 20mg of prednisone 2/day, and a z pack to clear it up. I didn’t question it at the time but now am questioning if i need to take the z pack. To clarify I did not ask for antibiotics at any point but at some point may have said that with my asthma I have trouble clearing up respiratory infections (which is true). Can I skip taking it while taking the other two meds?

Around three months ago I started to have reduced muscular endurance in my upper body. I first noticed while doing weighted pull-ups. My first working set was 12 reps, and I went onto my second expecting to get 10 but was only able to get 4. This happened across most upper body exercises, especially those that use my arms. Bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, bench pressing, you name it, my ability to recover just seemed to nosedive. I feel no increase in muscle soreness or anything, I just get tuckered out early. I’ve lost no strength or speed. I can still put up the same weight and when punching there’s no difference other than I just burn out faster. But what’s weird is it’s not uniform. My legs are completely unaffected and there’s no difference on back movements like deadlifts that don’t use the biceps. 

It’s not calories, I’m in the process of bulking and I’m this period went from 200lbs to 205lbs. 

I don’t think it’s water, if anything I’ve been drinking more not less.

I don’t think it’s CNS fatigue, I took a one week active deload where I halved all the weight I was lifting. After that didn’t work I took a two week total break from exercising, and that still hasn’t worked. 

I got my blood work done and everything came back normal, no electrolyte deficiencies and my test levels were fine. 

My sleep is a little worse than it was before because of background noise in my new place, but it’s not super significant. From an average of 7 hours and 45 mins to 7 hours and 15, according to my smartwatch.

I’m a lot more stressed than I was before because I’m in school, but it seems reasonable to me
that stress would affect my entire body. I don’t get how that would make only my arms burn out.

I saw my GP and he just told me to take it easy for a few days (I already have) and to make sure I don’t get dehydrated (it hasn’t been an issue).

Doesn't smoke / Drinks occasionally, one glass while eating.

My father has always been lovely, calm, caring and very wise, during good and bad times. Never controlling, manipulative or abusive. 
Also, he never had any speech/hearing/memory issues before. All symptoms started when he was 55 years old ( almost 56). His cognitive issues get worse in the evening.

Memory loss;

Paranoia, he's VERY suspicious of everyone;

Mixing memories / events / words and then talking about untrue facts / false accusations;

Sentences without common sense;

Unaware of his inappropriate words;

Unaware of his speech/language impairment;

Ask same questions over and over again;

Forgetting keys / dates / appointments / where he places objects;

Can't understand anything or understands the opposite of what we say;

Changing plans every 5 minutes because he forgets what he was supposed to do before;

Saying something different about a topic every 5 minutes;

Getting defensive / feeling shocked when we talk about his behaviour because he doesn't remember anything;

Here some examples when he's not in his right mind:

When people talk (strangers included) he feels threatened without any reason and gets defensive. When he is driving he uses inappropriate words towards strangers. During his dark moments he can't understand anything people say and can't speak normally like he used to do before his decline. He forgets things to do after 5 minutes. Once he accused a clerk of spying on him and began to complain. Another time he made some stupid jokes in front of another employee. During an argument he said something inappropriate to a neighbor. Even in front of the family doctor he can't explain himself well and gets nervous. 

He said that me and mother hate him, that it would be better without his presence (you know what I mean).When we talk he feels threatened by us and says that we accuse him of things he never did, making things up to make him feel bad. During a conversation at home he said my mother told a boy to throw himself into the street and d*e. It's not true. He once told me that my mother was sick because I didn't make her stop smoking, but actually she was having a completely different and unrelated health problem. There is no common sense here. How can a person be responsible for others? When he was sane (before his cognitive decline) the whole family talked about quitting, without any issues or misunderstanding. The list goes on...

He's acting completely out of character, he isn't aware of his condition and what people see/hear from him. Every day, hour or minute can be different. One moment 
he's normal and the other not. He loves us and during clarity moments, when we try talk to him about his changes, starts to cry because he's confused. .

He was prescribed memory supplements/vitamins but they didn't work. 
Me and my mother have tried to talk about his symptoms with his new family doctor and she clearly said there's no need to do anything because my father can still drive, gardening, he's still self sufficient and not violent. He never had a neurological examination.  We don't know what to do.

OBGYN suggested we wait a couple months and see if it went away on its own. Returned one month ago to find it had grown to 5.1 cm, so she suggested a laparoscopic oophorectomy. 

Her pre-op bloodwork came back with slightly elevated CA-125 (results were 62), so the OB said if my wife wasn’t in pain she could schedule a second opinion with the Gyn Oncologist. So we did and met him about a week ago.  

He ordered more blood work (inhibin-b and CA 19-9) and an MRI. Bloodwork all came back normal but the MRI confirmed a likely borderline tumor in the left ovary; but perhaps more concerning was a suspicious “nodule” on her lower pelvic rectal wall. 

Doctor scheduled surgery to be the next day, this past Wednesday. He called me during the surgery to say that the ovary was probably a borderline tumor but that the frozen section of the nodule came back as cancerous and there were some “suspicious white dots on the rectal wall” so he wanted to do the full hysterectomy. I told him to do whatever he needed to help her get better. 

The next morning he came in to talk to us. He said he had take additional tissue samples from a couple of lymph nodes and other area around the abdomen we won’t know about those results until pathology comes back. But he had two photos from the surgery and said he tried to removed as many of the white dots as possible but that he couldn’t get them all; that some he tried to remove, but “due to inflammation they wouldn’t peel off” or something along those lines. 

These are the two images in question. https://imgur.com/a/X2ueCxL

I’ve been in and out of the hospital and surgeries since then, I had a bone graft on my back and pelvis due to it not healing correctly. At the time, they had told me I would need to come back and get checked out before having a child.

I sliped and held on to an edge with my left arm. All of my weight was put on the shoulder joint and it dislocated.

I have done an MRI that shows a Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesion. I have been told that the Hill-Sachs is not significant.

I have seen two Orthopaedics and they both recommend surgery. However since they are surgeons themselves I believe they can be biased.

I have been told many times that my current risk for recurrence stands at 80% and with arthroscopic Bankart repair it will be down to 5-10%.

I like doing sports (mostly cardio related, swimming and some casual basketball) and overhead exercises such as pull-ups but I don't do much more than that.

If I do my physio and strengthening correctly, is there a chance I can be confident that my shoulder doesn't dislocate again?

Also, are there any ""hidden risks"" with surgery? E.g I'm told that shoulder stiffness will go away but I'm not sure that's 100% true.

No medication, good health

What’s the likelihood of a baby suffering a dural tear (around the brain, not spine) at birth due to the use of forceps? 

My baby is 5 months old, has always been a picture of health, but recently I felt an indented line on the side of his head, which feels like it is branching off from the coronal suture. After researching online, the indented line is in a place I wouldn’t expect a suture line to be. 

I’ve taken him to see a GP (UK) who thinks it’s a suture line, however she barely touched his head and said that forceps wouldn’t cause a skull fracture 🤔 As a new, first time mama, my mind is naturally going to the worst case scenario: what if my baby suffered a skull fracture which has gone undetected, and what if he also suffered a dural tear which is going to lead to a growing fracture?!

I noticed these as he was screaming when he would urinate, but I think I caught them early because he did not have a fever. Originally the pediatric urologist suggested a wait and see method,  but after the 3rd UTI he advised to go on prophylactic antibiotics (Bactrim) and scheduled a DMSA scan. 

His most recent ultrasound:
-Kidneys are symmetric and normal in size. 
-Dilation of the left renalpelvis measuring up to 0.8 cm. Dilation of the left proximal ureter versus
extrarenal pelvis measuring 1.6 cm. No suspicious mass.
-Circumferential bladder wall thickening measuring up to 0.4 cm. Prevoid bladder

I understand that the DMSA scan is used to look for scarring but my question is what happens if scarring is found? Is there any treatment that can be done for scarred kidneys or is it just something useful to know?

They started antibiotics treatment and her CRP went down to 187.69 after 3 days. So it is roughly half of the original value.

Yesterday (after 3 days of the last blood test), the CRP was exactly the same as before. How likely is that? I dont mean that it necessarily have to be better, as it can be worse too, but as far as I know it is so sensitive that it is very unlikely to be the same. Her WBC went down though, not in the normal range yet..

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/16a6wgo/why\_was\_my\_friends\_chronic\_cough\_cure\_by\_chemo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/16a6wgo/why_was_my_friends_chronic_cough_cure_by_chemo/)

Original post:

Female, 50yrs, 5'7"", 140lbs, non smoker, celiac, had uterine cancer

My friend has had a chronic cough for about five years now. Last year, she was diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer and underwent chemo as part of her treatment, and she is now recovered.

She told me that her cough subsided when she was on the chemo and has gradually returned after her treatment was complete. What is the explanation for this? Do they give antihistamines or something along with chemo? Is there anything she can do to replicate the effect?

Update:

I made this post on September 10th of last year, and my friend passed away on July 8th of this year from Adenoid Cysctic Carcinoma of the lungs.

This was a completely different cancer than her uterine cancer, and the oncologist believes it predated the uterine cancer - all the way back to when her chronic cough began in 2019. Apparently, this kind of cancer is extremeley rare to have in the lungs and is very slow growing... until it isn't. She was diagnosed with and treated for everything from GERD to Whooping Cough to Anxiety in that time, but eventually just learned to live with it.

The oncologist said this type of cancer was not very responsive to chemotherapy, and so I don't know why it would have affected her chronic cough, but I know it was a relief to her when it did. Maybe the chemo affected the tumors just enough to keep her from coughing so much, though obviously it didn't make the cancer go away.

There was an attempt to remove everything surgically. Though by the time they got in there, it had spread to her chest wall lining her diaphragm, and the sac around her heart, it seemed everything was good, and she would be cancer free. After having read up on Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma before she died, I realize this was some very optimistic thinking. This somewhat counters the twinge of resentment I have that the doctors didn't at least try chemo since it had taken away her cough so much.

By her two month PET scan after the surgery, her whole body was lit up. She took one look at the results and said, ""Oh, my god, I'm going to die. I need to finish watching Succession!"" There was definitely some grief over the years of cancer treatment, but she was more than prepared at the end, in good spirits, and ready to teach the rest of us what it means to live right up until you're officially out of this life.

My original post didn't get any comments, but I figured it was worth an update. Maybe this will help someone to look further into a patient's complaints. Or, at most, know that you're alive, and this is the time to do your living.",2024-11-10 18:58:34

What type of doctor do I need to be looking into for someone who is recovering addict and since he's been clean feels absolutely horrible we fully believe that the years of damage have taken its toll over his whole body but we cannot find a doctor that first of all is even willing to hear him out seriously without judgment or the few doctors that have heard him out they don't really know where to begin nor has they given us any direction to go into so I don't know if there's any doctors that specialize in addiction not like treating it like with maintenance drugs but treating the after effects of addiction and the damage. I just need to know where to go to start.

**This is incredibly long but it's incredibly detailed and I don't think I have ever been more desperate in my life to find an answer so please find it in your heart to try and read it all if you can that's all I ask thank you so much**

For background he is a 35 year old male he's been clean for 4 years going on five for three of those years he was 100% abstinate this last year he decided to get back on Suboxone. He takes it as prescribed in fact takes less of it and that is the only thing he takes he does not partake in anything else not even drinking. He also received treatment for Hepatitis C about 2 years ago he successfully completed it and it's undetectable completely. For background on his addiction he started using heavy drugs around the age of 12 he started out using opiates like Oxycontin Etc from there it progressed to any and every kind of opiate out there he used benzos heavily for many years but went quite a few years before he completely got clean without using any benzos. He was a very very very very heavy meth addict alongside a heavy opiate addiction also he was an IV user for over 90% of his active use. He has used just about every drug out there besides PCP regularly but his two continuous drugs he used throughout those years were opiates of any kind and methamphetamine and both were always an IV ROA. In those years he did have some bouts of sobriety well MAT assisted sobriety. The longest bouts of full-blown abstinence he had when he was incarcerated which is a lot of the time he would go a couple months at a time not by choice but those were his complete abstinent moments. He got sober when he was 31 years old. He entered a drug court treatment program by choice he had the option of doing his full sentence in jail or requesting drug court so he could change his life and that is what he chose to do and he fully dedicated himself he never slipped in that entire time. For the first year he wasn't quite as miserable but over the course of the last 3 years he has just gotten significantly worse. When his doctor first discovered his hepatitis C levels were pretty high when he came to her because he was feeling awful she started the treatment he finished the treatment all during the treatment he felt great and for the first 6 months after he felt back to normal but after that 6 months he went right back to that awful feeling. His symptoms are chronic and I mean like severe fatigue it doesn't matter how many hours of sleep he gets or rest he never wakes up rested or with energy. He has severe insomnia he is prescribed trazodone for that it works enough that he can get a decent amount of sleep but it's very broken sleep. He's always in constant pain he has a really bad back and neck he absolutely destroyed his neck and back in a vehicle wreck when he was 18 and he's never gone to a doctor to deal with it or treat it in any way but that pain we know the source to it so that's not really of concern but he is all over pain and his muscles and Joints no matter what he does it's like his body is always twisted and uncomfortable and coupled with that chronic and severe fatigue he doesn't have energy for anything he has to force himself to do everyday tasks all the time. For the first year and a half he was able to gain weight normally and keep it on but for the rest of the time you cannot put on wait at all no matter how hard he tries no matter what he eats he cannot gain weight he is really really thin. He also suffers from severe constipation and he takes a stool softener daily he takes laxative quite often he uses enemas we have tried everything just last night we got magnesium citraite and that didn't even work he only goes a little at a time but he is severely constipated sometimes he is gone months at a time and eventually he goes we don't know what causes it but it just happens. Lately it has been much worse he became regular and then all of a sudden he became incredibly constipated and like almost compacted his stomach was like bloated within a matter of two to three days. He's only managed to get a day or two relief between those times it makes him so sick he can't eat we have tried everything we don't know what to do to get him regular. The way he describes it to me is that he's so exhausted and so absolutely run down he can feel it in his soul that's what he said it feels like that's the best way he can describe it. For a long time I have really believe maybe he has an autoimmune disease but in order to figure that out you have to be referred to specialist and we can't even find a doctor that's willing to hear us out. So I'm truly hoping that there is some type of doctor out there that deals with addiction but only the aspects of addiction that include the after damage etc. We don't know where to begin or what's he even begin to tell a doctor to look for you know. I'm so sorry this is so long but this is been 4 years and we can't figure it out we don't know where to go and there's nothing more painful to me than watching the man that I love and that has worked his ass off to change his life suffer like this. This man hadn't spent a single year of his life out of jail since he was 12 years old until he was 31 when he met me he has not step foot in a jail in 4 years or been on probation in almost three. During his drug court probation he also pursued his degree and graduated after two long years of hard work with his maintenance technician degree. He has changed his whole life and work so hard and it's so hard to be doing all the right things and still feel awful.

4 days ago I went to the doctor because I had back pain localised to one spot on my lower right back, doctor gave me a 3 day antibiotic  because he suspected a kidney infection. Last night me and my boyfriend tested positive for Covid, so we are both sick but I seem to be worse than him. 

My temperature has been up and down all day ranging from 36.5 to 38.4, I also have chills every now and then accompanied by leg aches. Also a runny nose, headache and I drank a full 500ml water 2 hours ago and now I can’t stop peeing every 15mins. 

I have been taking paracetamol and my prescribed antibiotics for my suspected kidney infection but I feel very off its very hard to describe. 

What I am most concerned about right now is sepsis. Because I have Covid and a suspected kidney infection how am I to tell if I’ve turned septic ??

I am diagnosed with anxiety so I am trying to rationalise with myself that it’s probably my anxiety talking but really how am I supposed to know lol ",2024-11-11 23:55:53

Not sure what to think of this situation. This morning I got up and took a shower and pissed blood. I noticed it immediately when my urine was an off color.

It looked like some clots came out too but there's also been small pieces of things sliding around my shower.

Aside from that, when I checked my urethra there was blood basically slow pouring from it. It wasn't a lot but enough to freak me out. It was like there was a small cut or something 

(I've also had small blood spots in my semen a few times recently)

Now what I did the night before was.. high risk. I drank a to, sniffed a half gram of cocaine, and then took home a transsexual and had unprotected drunk sex.

Feels pretty stupid looking back at it.

Could be cancer, kidney/prostate issues, or I got some kind of std immediately. 

What should I do? I have *not* pissed blood since.",2024-11-11 22:42:41

In Summer of ‘23 I went to an orthopedic doc for right shoulder pain.  I had injured the same shoulder approx 10 years prior but never got an MRI done bc of no insurance.  It had been bothering me more so I thought it was time.  MRI found a bone cyst in my proximal humerus & fibrous dysplasia in the distal humerus.  Saw a specialist & he said do nothing about that & get the labrum tear addressed.  Did that in Sept ‘23.  In Feb ‘24 I noticed my right sternoclavicular joint was enlarged.  Dull ache there most times, but more sore after working out.  Saw same ortho doc.  He suggested an ultrasound guided injection.  Worked for the pain, no reduction in swelling.  Fast forward to July ‘24 & a MRI ordered for that.  Synovial hyperplasia w/ bone erosion-looks like inflammatory issue.  Saw a rheumatologist & started on leflunomide.  I complained about back pain which lead to X-rays of cervical, thoracic & SI joints.  All areas showed mild osteoarthritis.  In addition to that it showed possible compression fractures at T3, T4 & T5.  X-ray showed a slight levocurvature at T9.  Another MRI- compression fractures at T2-T5 with an abnormal signal at T6.  Mentions a vertebral hemangioma is possible there.  No curvature on the MRI noted.  Now I have a bone scan ordered & a consult with an endocrinologist pending.  
Now actual symptoms…. Nothing but back pain prior to starting meds.  Clavicle ached, but very manageable.  Since starting the med about 60 days ago I have extreme fatigue, cold fingers, migraines and pain that seemingly moves all over.  My back though has been killing me.  I’m talking hurts to breath pain located medial to my right scapula.  I know this is in the same area as the compression fractures but I was told those were chronic, so should they be hurting this bad??  I was working out 3-4 days a week doing CrossFit.  Now one workout takes me at least 3 days to recover.  It feels like I went from feeling good to complete garbage in just a couple months.  
I’m worried that I was misdiagnosed or that something else is wrong.  I feel like I am getting pushed from one test to another that is leading to new specialists and no one really knows me or what is happening.  

I’m 45, Caucasian Female.  Also should mention that I am limited on medications to take since I donated a kidney 6 years ago.  If anyone has suggestions of how to manage this and/or what I should be asking at appointments I would appreciate the help.  ",2024-11-12 02:12:16

Probably at least from 2011-2012 and onward. I don't know exactly when but it should have been around that time when I started noticing it. Basically, I constantly feel pressure inside and around my ear (mostly deep inside). It varies in pressure but it's always there.

These are the symptoms I am experiencing.

* Feels like there is water in my right ear.
* My right ear canal is quite a bit smaller (tighter?) than my left. Not sure if that is from the pressure.
* I do have ringing (tinnitus) in my right ear.
* Feel deep pressure in my right ear as well as deep in my sinuses (only right side).
* If I put my finger into my right ear, as the finger goes in, up until I completely seal it, it sounds like there is air rushing through my ear. Think of it as if you were very lightly but constantly blowing on a microphone. Sometimes I can replicate it by just hovering my hand over my ear without even putting my finger. I think it depends on how much pressure there is during that time.
* If I go to loud venues (bars, concerts etc), usually after about 10 minutes my right ear will literally start to crackle, pulsate (think fluttery feeling) and the pressure increases. You know when audio levels get too loud and they start to clip? It's like that. It's not constant but it will happen multiple times per minute. Obviously to the point where I usually just leave. It seems like it's the bass and the treble that really affect it.
* If I listen to music too loud in the car, same as above. Only affects the right ear.
* The pressure makes wearing headphones and earbuds uncomfortable after after only about 30 minutes. The intimate music seems to fatigue my ear and causes it feel even more ""full"".
* If I wear my Airpods and listen to music, sometimes I will also get the crackling and air rushing feeling.
* When I workout, the ""fullness"" gets amplified. It's as if I landed in a plane but my right ear won't pop. If I bend over or tilt my head forward as if I'm looking down to touch my toes, it will alleviate the fullness but will come back as soon as my head is upright again. I assume this is because my heart beat and blood flow is at a much higher pace. Once my heart beat returns to normal, that extreme fullness goes away.

In 2013 I went to an ENT to get my ear checked out as well as to get an allergy test as I have semi severe allergies. They looked inside and didn't see any earwax blocking the canal, which I wished they did because then they could just clean it out. They looked up my nose and didn't really say anything. They did a hearing test and the doctor was actually surprised with how good my hearing was in both ears. I explained the situation to him about the loud music, thumping and the air rushing feeling.

The doctor literally told me, **""There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your ear, I think your imagining it.""** Ultimately left the doctor with a $1,300 bill after insurance. Which honestly has put me off from going to another ENT since.

In December 2020 I went to Patient's First to have them look at my ear. They said they did notice some wax but not enough to cause blockage. They went ahead and blasted out all the wax in both ears, some chunks came out but nothing significant. For the next few days my ear did feel ""better"", the pressure did subside a bit and when I went to work out, that added pressure wasn't there. However, that only lasted about a week until the pressure came back.

Obviously I've done some of my own research and found things like Eustachian Tube Dysfunction etc.

The only prescribed medications I take is Finasteride, which has only been within the past few years.

I don't smoke or do drugs.

Any advice?",2024-11-12 05:27:50

A little background, I'm a 28y female and I just had my second child 9 months ago. After I had my child, I experienced a super heavy feeling near my tailbone and everytime I would use the bathroom, it's like I could never finish because it felt like it was ""blocked"" (I guess...? Just bare with me please). I got checked out and everything seemed to be okay. Cool. But about three weeks ago, I started experiencing heavy bloating in my lower abdomen accompanied with bleeding while having diarrhea, also excessive sweating, cramps, headaches and just feeling as though I have a constant fever when I in fact do not. Every time I drink something or eat, I have to run to the bathroom immediately after. I know I can't get diagnosed on Reddit of course but there's a MAJOR shortage and issue with getting appointments where I'm from so I guess I was just wondering if you all could tell me what it COULD be and what my next steps should be since I'm having a serious problem with getting an appointment any time soon. Family background if it helps: I have nothing besides asthma and alopecia but a few years back, I did go down to 88lbs with no explanation whatsoever and have had a random lump under my left collarbone for years but was told it's because I'm petite although I don't have it on my right side. my moms side of the family has a history of breast cancer and diabetes. I'm not to sure about my dads side due to him being adopted. Again I'm not looking for a diagnosis of course, I'm just looking for advice and what it could possibly be since the change was so sudden. Also, I do eat pretty healthy and drink tons of water. I don't smoke and I do drink on occasion. Thank you in advance and please be kind :)",2024-11-12 05:09:11

In May I got extremely sick and ended up spending 10 days in the hospital. Prior to that I didn’t have symptoms. Now they won’t seem to go away. I don’t have insurance, so I can’t ask my primary to run a ton of tests and find out the problem. I am hoping someone could give me some advice so I could go in and ask for specific things, or discuss specific options before agreeing to run the gamut, because I can’t afford it. 


In May when I got sick, here is the short version of what happened. I got up on Wednesday, went to work, felt totally fine and normal. That night, I put two of my kids to bed, when I went to put my third kid to bed, I started feeling strange. My hands were shaking uncontrollably, I was freezing, and everything just felt wrong. I got into the shower, hoping it would warm me up. I was in the shower for only a couple of minutes and I fainted. I remember everything starting to spin rapidly and the edges of my vision got dark. The next thing I remember I was on the floor of the shower, I don’t know how long I was out. 

When I got up, my entire body hurt, like I had been in a major car wreck. I couldn’t even stand up straight. I live alone (except for my young kids) and I was not thinking very clearly unfortunately. Instead of calling someone or 911, I crawled into my bed. The next morning when I woke up, my body was in so much pain I couldn’t roll over. I called my mom. She came and took my kids to watch them. 

48 hours later when she came back, I was still in bed. I had only gotten up 2-3 times to pee. Each time I got out of bed I either fainted or ended up in the floor because I was so light headed. 

She took me to the hospital. They said my kidneys were down to 5% function. I don’t remember the majority of the first few days I was there, I didn’t get out of bed, I mostly just slept. After that, I laid in bed, kind of in and out. I lost 20 pounds in ten days. I threw up one time the day before I was released, after they let me eat for the first time. Other than that, nothing really happened. They tested me for Covid, hepatitis, a bunch of autoimmune diseases, and an extremely long list of viruses. They couldn’t find anything in my system or any positive results. In the end they declared it food poisoning and sent me home. 

I tried to argue with the diagnosis, since I didn’t have any symptoms of food poisoning. They assured me they were correct and released me. 

Since getting out of the hospital my hands and feet keep going numb. They get extremely cold, like I’m holding ice. They tingle to the point that it is painful. When it gets really bad, my fine motor skills decline, and things like typing are hard. I keep hitting the wrong key or my fingers are difficult to move. It isn’t constant, it comes and goes. Some days I don’t have it at all. Some days it feels like it last the entire time I am awake. 

I never experienced this before getting sick. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you!",2024-11-12 05:06:16

I’m a 19F 5’5 170lbs. I have no pre-existing medical conditions, and I do not take any prescription medication. But I do vape and smoke marijuana. I also work a job that requires me to be on my feet on average 4-8 hours a day, and around 30-35 hours a week.

On October 31st, I was at work when all the sudden I felt like I was gonna pass out. By pass out I mean a lightheaded/dizzy feeling accompanied by “tunnel vision,” and it sounded like I was “underwater.” I ended up sitting down and not passing out, but went home to be safe. 

The next day, November 1st, I head back into work and the same thing happens. I felt like I was just gonna drop and pass out. So I called a family member and asked them to take me to a walk-in clinic. At the clinic they ran standard tests (such as blood pressure, listening to my heart and lungs, looking in my eyes and ears, testing my strength by having me push and pull against there hands etc…) As well as they ordered a blood draw, checking my blood sugar, and a urine test. My blood pressure was a little bit high and blood sugar was a little low. But Doctor said it was “nothing concerning and I was most likely dehydrated and stressed.” The Doctor was very pleasant and kind so I took her word for it and proceeded to drink around 3 liters of water for the next two days and rested. 

But then on November 4th (three days after my walk in visit) everything just seemed to get a lot worse. I still felt like I was gonna pass out, but now everytime I felt like I was gonna pass out I got extremely confused, felt extremely weak, my entire left side (arm and leg) felt extremely tingly to the point it was almost numb, and all my toes and finger felt very cold and were turning a blue color. Of course as I was very concerned I asked a family member to drive me to the E.R. My family member ended up having to put me into a wheel chair to prevent me from falling down. A nurse ends up taking me back, and I describe my symptoms to the nurse. At this point I had also figured out my symptoms come and go, usually brought on by standing/exercising. So I inform the nurse of that as well. Four hours pass by as I’m waiting to see the Doctor (I completely understand the E.R. Is super busy, and there’s definitely higher priority cases, but within those four hours all my symptoms had basically dissipated.) Doctor then comes to see me, does the standard tests and orders a blood draw, ECG, and a urine sample. After a short wait for the tests the Doctor comes back and informs me my ECG and urine test both look normal. But that my White Blood Cell Count is high (around 13-14 I believe.) But we have ruled out that I’m not drunk, pregnant, or diabetic. As well as I don’t have Covid-19, the flu, a cold, and most general “sicknesses.” Doctor informs me she is not sure what’s causing it, but she believes it to be something related to my heart or vascular system. (Doctor said it was highly unlikely to be anything neurological as well.) So Doctor gave me a recommendation for a Cardiologist to visit. 

So November 11th I go visit the Cardiologist Doctor I inform Cardiologist about all my symptoms I’ve been having, but that they haven’t been as severe as what they were on Monday. (But they were still occurring.) They then run another ECG on me that comes up as completely normal. (I had not had any symptoms that day as well, as my appointment was pretty early in the morning.) The only thing from the testing that showed up was my blood pressure was pretty low. 
Doctor tells that I’m dehydrated and most likely stressed out. I politely respond that I’ve been drinking 3 Liters of water a day and have been relaxing for almost a week at this point. (I have enough sick time at work to cover 2 weeks off. So I had not worked since November 1st at this point.) Doctor understood my concern, and said that we could do a heart monitor for 14 days just in case if there is something they are missing. I agreed, and booked an appointment for November 27th to start the heart monitor. (It was booked far out for insurance to have time to approve it.) Doctor also informed me that I should return to work as of November 18th as well. 

I would also like to clarify are the Doctors, Nurses, and staff have all been very kind and understanding to/with me. Medical professionals you all are true superhero’s and thank you for taking the time to read this! I am NOT a medical professional myself but I really just do not think that my symptoms are caused by dehydration or stress. So I’m just putting this out there to see if anyone could have any possible ideas of what this could be. Thank you!",2024-11-12 04:52:32

As a child, I used to wake up in the middle of the night in a panicked episode, this started occurring when I was in between 5-6 years old. My mom had always said that I just had night terrors, and I believed her.

I now just recently had the same thing happen and it’s very vivid, and I don’t think it’s a night terror but I will try my best to go into detail about it:

Today I was just laying there under my weighted blanket that helps me sleep, when suddenly everything around me just felt like it was getting further and further away, even though I wasn’t moving. Then I get images of textures in my head that feel weird and it made me start panicking. The thing that scared me the most was the fact that everything felt like it was constantly zooming out and super far away.

Some other information: I have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD, but I don’t know if this would qualify under my GAD since it feels different from a panic attack, and no grounding methods work. Why I’m asking is because I was doing some research to see if it would help a night terror, but the internet said that people usually don’t get up and move during these, which as a kid I did. The internet also said that people typically don’t remember and are often unaware of these night terrors.

I would appreciate more questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

Surely I would know if I had chronic pancreatitis?  I had the same GI issues for 15+ years before finding out I had EPI and had just been told it's ""my normal"" or an anxious stomach.

A bit over a month ago my twin sister got diagnosed with anorexia. She’s in a hospital now and getting better. 
I was really afraid when she got diagnosed that I would end up like that because I read it was genetic. I didn’t understand at all, I’ve never cared about my body and I still don’t…but I feel like I’ve been fixating on not becoming anorexic so much that I’m actually creating a problem. I went from 113 to 104 in the last month. I keep getting scared that I’m not eating enough so then I go and eat a lot, like panic eating to try and not under eat and I est so much that I feel sick and embarrassed and gross and at first I was trying to run it off but then I realized I could just throw it up….and I started doing that. I know it’s not good, obviously. And it’s super gross. But does this mean I’m accidentally making myself anorexic because of how hard I’m trying to avoid it? 
I don’t care about my weight…I’m not trying to lose weight but I keep losing it anyway. I’m just stuck in this cycle where I feel scared that I’m not eating enough and I suddenly need to set everything but then after I feel so horrible and I want it gone. 
My mom keeps seeing that I’m eating a ton and telling me I don’t have to eat for me and my sister and that I’m going to get diabetes…I feel like this isn’t good but I don’t know who to ask about this because it’s going to sound so stupid when my sister was literally almost dead from starving herself to ask if I have an issue.

I feel embarrassed posting about this, but it has happened a few times recently so Im just winging this. It involves my heart. 

So probably 3 times in like the past 6 months Ive gotten this funny feeling in my chest. Ill be sitting there fine and all of a sudden it will feel like there’s a sudden shift and my heart isnt beating normally. Im familiar with heart palpitations because Ive had those before (like where your heart skips a beat or starts beating stupidly fast all of a sudden) but this isnt that. It doesnt hurt per se, but I definitely feel a sudden change inside my chest and in the way my heart beats. I can definitively feel when it happens and it feels noticeably uncomfortable. It will just up and happen when Im standing or sitting minding my own business. Not after a run, not during crazy exercise, not after taking a strong medication, none of that. At most I maybe have 1 cup of coffee in the morning but Ive had it happen in the evening and I never go over 1 cup. 

Not long ago it lasted for a solid minute. I was sitting down on a couch and suddenly I felt that big shift inside my chest. My heart felt like it was beating the wrong way, and it was really uncomfortable. There was pressure and it just felt really yucky. It lasted for a solid minute to the extent where I almost called out for someone but then it went away. The fact that it lingered scared me. 

Am I being dramatic? Is there anything that can be done? Is this something to see a doctor about? ",2024-11-12 04:22:13

Anyways about 3-4 weeks ago I read a story about someone having penile cancer and having to get his penis removed, I googled the symptoms of penile cancer and well... now I am posting here lol. I noticed something that somewhat looked like a bruise a week or two earlier. I am also absolutely convinced it wasn't always there, because it's something I would of noticed way sooner if it was always there. It didn't cause any pain(still doesn't) so I tried to just ignore and see if it just naturally goes away, two and a half weeks go by and it hadn't gone away or changed at all, I decided to stop masturbating and about a week and a half later it still hasn't changed or gone away.

 Should quickly mention, that there is zero pain no matter what I'm doing, flaccid, erect, peeing, masturbating, etc etc. And looking at the other symptoms of penile cancer online I'm not noticing any of them. Should also mention that its hardly noticeable at all when I am erect. Also the visibility of the mark changes dramatically depending on how flaccid I am, if my penis decides to be extra small (say when im nervous, cold, or just after a work out) it looks even more pronounced, but when I'm at my ""normal"" flaccid state it seems less noticeable.

AskDocs,1gpcakd,Ribcage and upper front torso feel sore/strained ~two weeks after bench press PR (no bouncing),1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpcakd/ribcage_and_upper_front_torso_feel_sorestrained/,5,"After I hit my personal bench press PR (255x1) about 1.5 or two weeks ago ago, I had a normal degree of chest pump/soreness the day or two after but also have since had this weird feeling that the soreness remained, but wasnt just the muscle and was slightly more like a weird feeling on my ribcage. Last week I only did one push day as a result, and when I benched it felt super weird. I did 225x2 without a spotter (usually can get 5 reps on my own and was going to do one set of 5 then get a spotter to try for a 6th or 7th) and after the set I didnt feel comfortable to do more sets. I finished off the day with dips, machine chest flies, I even didnt do incline as I was worried. Anyway, I thought the issue was just that I was only a few days out from my 1RM. Now, about another whole week later, as I took a break from benching due to this, I still feel the same weird soreness almost underneath my pec muscle. When I warm up on bench my pecs get sore but then the deeper ribcage feeling is more pronounced. It also felt like my front collarbone was slightly feeling something too. It's mostly in the center of my ribcage between my pecs, which I haven't had any big physical trauma or anything towards. Haven't had the wind knocked out of me or anything as of late and I don't have any conditions that I can think of which would cause this

I'll clarify a few things:

1) when I bench press I NEVER bounce the weight off my chest, for one because I don't count that as a rep but also am terrified to shatter something doing that, so it's always a soft touch and back up, I also do not bench with a significant back arch or poke my chest out, though maybe that's a bad thing

2) if it matters I have a slight ribcage deformity, idk the name bc it was never serious enough thst I had to have it operated on, it was colloquially named pigeon chest or birdcage chest I think, pretty sure it's made my breathing kinda weird in sone ways like I have more of a tendency to breathe with my mouth open when I sleep, but I'm also not someone who strictly breathes with my mouth open or anything

3) I haven't been able to get 8 hours of sleep in a night for a few weeks now, that might be part of it, but I try never to get less than 6 or 7 if I can, at least based on when I go to bed. But I haven't missed meals or been underhydrated for sure, I drink tons of water and eat a good amount

4) I've never had a chest injury or anything. I have been working out for awhile, haven't been as consistent the past few weeks but I haven't gone a week without hitting any muscle group so I don't think it's an effect caused by just getting back to the gym after some time

I just really want to know if this is something serious or indicates something or if there's anything I can do. Because I wanted to push for a higher PR by the end of the year and right now I don't feel good even benching what I have been the past couple months now

Since July, he has suggested a knee scope. I had to wait to see him again until my lawyer closed my case.

I got a second opinion two weeks ago from another orthopedic doctor who told me a conservative treatment would fix me. Basically another injection and physical therapy. He told me surgery is not needed for my condition. 

Today, I saw the first ortho and told me that I’ve waited to long and I need surgery asap. So he scheduled me for a knee scope tomorrow.

 ENT apt was scheduled before all this happened which concluded his adenoids aren't helping get his nasal spray where it needs to go! BUT at the ENT apt I expressed concern over one of his lymph dones always being huge it sticks out of the neck so the doctor said she isn't concerned because he has been fighting infection for some time but if I wanted to we could do an ultrasound. Of course I said yes. Took a month to get in to be seen but we got in there his lymph's where much smaller than the prior month I was happy but the ultrasound found a cyst on his left thyroid node
I know it's a colloid cyst 6x2 looks like the inside is mixed with fluid slash maybe solid ? Has a tail. based on the CCRS guidelines I found I scored it at a 2.

AskDocs,1gpbf7x,PLEASE HELP! 27F with recurring mystery “episodes”,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpbf7x/please_help_27f_with_recurring_mystery_episodes/,2,"
Hi docs. 27F here living in Texas. 5’2, 185 lbs, 16 months into breastfeeding. I’m still 10 lbs over my pre-pregnancy weight. I’ve been experiencing some odd symptoms since June and I’d love any input. I’ve seen my PCP about this, but she’s become rather dismissive since her practice has grown.

I had my first and only child in July 2023. In around June of this year (11 months PP), I began having these “episodes”. Around 3-8 pm daily, I experience irregular heartbeats, nausea, severe headache, and lightheadedness to the point if I don’t sit or lay down, I feel I will pass out. I’ve not actually passed out but have come very close. These symptoms come on whether I’m sitting or standing, at home or in a car. They persist until I go to sleep, then I just wake up feeling like sh*t. It’s very strange and overwhelming and exhausting. Nothing particularly helps other than drinking cold water sometimes. I’ve tried eating/not eating to see if that affects anything and it does not. I also have 0 energy. The most basic tasks take everything out of me. I’m sleepy all of the time and have difficulty focusing on tasks. My head feels very fuzzy too, like there’s cotton or something in my head. 

Prior to becoming pregnant, I was on Buspar for anxiety and Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism, which I’ve had both since I was a teen. I also have endometriosis and have had 2 laps to remove that. Lastly, I experience a complete uterine inversion after childbirth which had to be manually reinserted (long post on that on my page). 

Though I’ve had major anxiety for 10+ years I am 100% confident and absolutely certain these episodes are NOT anxiety. They are also not stress related as they come on on the weekends, on PTO, vacation, holiday. It doesn’t matter what I’m doing or where I am, they happen. My PCP sent me to a cardiologist who tested me for POTS as I thought maybe that was it. She said my test was negative, though my heart rate does jump 40-50 bpm just from standing up. I wore a halter monitor for a week and go in for an ultrasound next week. I won’t have the results on those until 11/25. 

My PCP said she was going to run extensive bloodwork on me in September. All she ran was thyroid and an ANA panel. No CBC or anything else. Since giving birth, I’ve had my thyroid tested a few times and it’s magically perfect now. The ANA panel came back positive for EBV, though I was never diagnosed with mono at any point in my life. Granted, my mother never took me to doctors when I was younger. What’s interesting is, about 5 years ago I had similar symptoms but it was primarily sleepiness and feeling drunk all the time almost—and an NP ran an ANA panel on me which came back positive for Lyme. This most recent ANA panel did not show Lyme. If that matters. Once my PCP told me I was positive for EBV, she said I’m probably just having a flare up and it’ll go away. I asked if there was anything I could do for energy and she told me to continue taking my B12. Which I’ve been on for a few months and most recently began taking Magnesium Glycinate. I called her back 2 days ago and said I really can’t take being this tired anymore and something has to be going on. She said that I’m welcome to come back and see her but they’ve done everything they can do for me because everything looks fine. 

I’m going through all the motions of the healthcare system since I was dumb and chose an HMO plan this year. But I’ve come to the conclusion that I need a new PCP because she, as I said, has been dismissive and not at all helpful. For what it’s worth, I’m also not really someone who goes to the doctor much other than for my annual or if I’m terribly sick. Idk. I just feel so hopeless. I have a toddler running around and I shouldn’t feel as exhausted as I do. I can’t put it into words. I used to work out 6 times a week and even going on nightly walks, I just feel depleted. I’m getting enough sleep and am sleeping fine. I know this can’t all be just from being a mom, especially considering it only all started in June. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice? Thank you in advance for your time!",2024-11-12 03:23:33

My boyfriend and I, both 26yo, have been trying for a baby for 18 months now. I have had a child from a previous relationship, he doesn’t have any. We were really thinking my PCOS is what was getting in the way of our conception. I’ve been on Letrozole for 5 months with nothing to show for it, so we finally did the semen analysis. 

The clinic told us the normal range for sperm per/ml is 15M, preferably with at least 10M good swimmers among them. My boyfriend has 8.4M per/ml, and only half a million are moving well. They told him they want to get him in to test his hormones, testosterone, and they will put him on a medication to increase sperm count and motility - and I should continue the Letrozole because “while we are working with a low amount, we still only need ONE.” 

I’m just wondering what this means for our conception journey. Severe oligospermia doesn’t sound promising. 
Is it possible to conceive with a count that low? 
Does anyone have any helpful tips, or natural ways to increase sperm count/testosterone? 
Is there still hope for a natural conception?

I had stage 2A Melanoma on left thigh in October 2023-protocol was wide excision removal with sentinel lymph node removal in groin (2 of them). All margins were clear and treatment was followup with surgical oncologist (6 months), dermatologist (3 months) and medical oncologist for signatera testing (6 months).   
I've had swelling at the node area off and on for a while now and some pain-I was told is normal and to expect this for at least a year. About 2 months ago, the pain started to become an everyday occurrence. I had my followup with the surgical oncologist last week, to which I mentioned that I was having pain. He ordered two ultrasounds and a ""3mm subcutaneous cystic focus which is on uncertain clinical significance"" was found in the area of where the melanoma was removed.   
Lymph nodes measured 7mmx7mm, 4mmx8mm and 7mmx3mm  
When I had my follow up for the test, the doctor was very dismissive. I was told it's nothing wrong. I questioned the definition of the cyst and I was told that ""it means its just a cyst"", with no further definition on what ""uncertain clinical significance"" meant in terms of my previous diagnosis of Melanoma.  
I asked about the 7mmx7mm lymph node and if its supposed to be round and I was told ""yes"", which sounded weird and I asked why the other two are oval like but this one is round and the response was ""it just is"". I then asked about the pain I was having and I was told to come back in a month and he will order an MRI if it persists. I told him it's a problem for me now as it makes my job harder for me to do  (I work in a job where I carry heavy gear) and I was told that I should ""try not to carry heavy gear and maybe take a month off to see if anything changes"". I was shocked at that response. I told him that in order to do that I can't work, I would have to go on disability and he's like ""yeah, let's follow up in a month and he's going to prescribe some lidocaine patches"".   
I feel totally dismissed, especially since Melanoma is known to return in the area of the original location and now I have a ""cyst"" in that area and pain, granted the cyst is small but it's a cyst (or so I am told). I did send a message to my medical oncologist, asking for him to take a look at the reports but I'm concerned about this.   
Am I overthinking this?

60M, no PMHx, no medications.

CC: 7lb weight loss over past year, GERD non responsive to medication with mild trouble swallowing \~ 1 month. Had endoscopy 10/31 which showed a mass which was biopsied and came back as Squamous Cell Carcinoma, esophageal cancer. Still eating normally, just has to drink water with meals. Otherwise no symptoms and still working his construction job.

He  had his first CT scan  of his chest, abdomen and pelvis at our local hospital. We are going to MGH in Boston for his first oncology appointment Wednesday.

I'm hoping to get some insights on the results that came through his portal.

The **initial abdominal CT report** came back with an “indeterminate 4.2 x 2.0 cm lobulated segment 4 hypodensity with foci of peripheral hyperdensity” in the liver, which the radiologist suggested might be a **hemangioma** (a common benign liver lesion). In the impression They specifically noted “no specific evidence of abdominopelvic metastatic disease.” Upon googling the radiologsit name, he was located at MGH.

Then, **shortly after**, the chest report came back from the same imaging session, but this time the liver lesion was labeled as “concerning for metastatic deposit” and they recommended an **ultrasound to further investigate** and potentially guide a biopsy. Now, I’m stuck wondering which of these impressions is more likely to be accurate and what the conflicting language means. This was reported by a radiologist at our local hospital.

Wanted to note that there were NO other findings, everything else including lymph nodes were unremarkable.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of **conflicting radiology report** before? Can hemangiomas look like metastasis in cancer patients, or does it lean more toward one diagnosis than the other? My dad’s liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are normal, which I heard could sometimes point away from liver metastasis, but I’m trying not to get my hopes up. Obviously any mass could be indicative of spread in a cancer patient, but is it taking a typical benign lesion and being a bit presumptive? Happy to copy the whole report if it would help, also feel free to messge.

I’d appreciate any advice, or if anyone has been through something similar, it would really help to hear your experience. Thanks!",2024-11-12 02:53:33

I had the plate put in last August.... pain never went away. I still had pain in adjacent joints (MCP of My thumb and tha area of my ulna) these are where most of my pain was originally was sent for a CT now new doctor. Says that the surgery never took (and may of not been needed that's a whole other thing) but  one of the ""screws"" has gone through and is now rubbing on the next bone.. he has given me the option to leave it in or take it out. In seems like a bad idea that's probobly just going to keep getting worse. Taking it out though he didn't really have a plan what we would do next. I have a feeling just taking it out can't be good? Wouldn't that leave my wrist more vulnerable to breaks?
I just want some input on what would most likely happen if I get it out ... also recently I have noticed that my one ulna is sticking up more then the other and kinda floating.. never noticed it before I had a nasty pop about a month ago

AskDocs,1gpaene,38/Male with low eGFR?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gpaene/38male_with_low_egfr/,1,"Age - 38

Sex/Gender - Male

Weight - 222

BMI - 30

Height - 5' 10""

Current Medications - Hydroxizine and Seroquel.

Non Smoker, Moderate/Low drinker.

So ill preface that I am 38 and am overweight for sure (Nothing crazy but def. need to lose some) but like forever my eGFR has never been above 90 at least in the past 5 years.

I've been a bit worried but no physician has really much batted an eye at it. I've had CT scans around my abdomen (Gastritis related thing) and they did note 2 ""Simple cysts"" on my kidneys, but my urologist said those were pretty common. I've had about 3 kidney stones in my life as well but didn't note anything else with them.

That being said here is how my eGFR has changed in the past 5 years:

* Most recent (03/2024) - 77 (Creatinine 1.23, nothing on urine dipstick besides trace protein)
* 07/2023 - 72 (Lowest it's ever been, but I was SUPER sick with a bad resp. virus for like a month and a half), creatinine was also high around 1.3, so slightly over
* 05/2023 - 81.5, creatinine 1.18
* also 04/2023 - 85.9, creatinine 1.13
* 12/2022 - 73.9, creatinine 1.28 (slightly over)
* 01/2021 - 95.9 , creatinine 1.07

So it feels like it's been swinging around. Thing is my urine dipsticks are always normal (sometimes a trace of protein, and there was one time I had a trace of protein, ketones and Leuk Esterase (whatever that means) but that was back in 2022).

However the rest of my CBC's/Metabolic panels are always completely fine. So I don't get it?

It feels like it's gone down overall....but it's kinda all over the place. I will say I probably don't drink as much as I should, I also read that higher BMI = lower eGFR (not sure if there is truth to that). My lipids are a bit high right now.

I'm not asking ""Do I have Kidney disease"" but more so if these levels seem concerning at all? FWIW my BMI is 30 almost exactly.",2024-11-12 02:30:40

It’s not every night, but the nights it occurs are really bad. I’m talking puking everything in my stomach out, plus dry heaving.

For context, I am a 20F 5’4 and 141lbs. I am a bodybuilder currently in a recomp phase, so my meals are consistent and don’t change day to day. The only “medicine” I am on is pill form birth control.

Other than nausea, my energy levels have been fairly low. I’ll typically crash after I get home from work around 2-3pm. I definitely don’t sleep as much as I should, usually get between 6-7 hours but sometimes around 5 on bad days.

Right now I’m leaning towards stopping the birth control, it was meant for hormonal purposes and I’ve been on it for a while but I keep seeing so many bad things about being on it.

Tired of feeling like shit and throwing up my meals randomly, so if anybody has any ideas about what’s going on I’m all ears.",2024-11-12 02:29:46

One of the side effects I have noticed since starting this medication (it’s the only med I’m on) is an increase in bruising/bleeding. I bruise much more easily than I used to and I also bleed a bit more. My periods are noticeably heavier, etc. 

The place I was referred to to have my wisdom teeth removed does the consultation/procedure on the same day. I get them removed in exactly a week. Should I stop taking my medication prior to the procedure? I reached out to ask the practice, and they just told me to mention it to the surgeon day of (which doesn’t seem like it would help if I do in fact need to stop taking the Prozac).

Admittedly I’m a bit freaked out by medications that can thin your blood, and how they can affect surgical procedures. Just wanna make sure I’m being safe and covering my bases :) has anyone here heard of Prozac causing complications with increased bleeding after surgery? 

I apologize if this is the wrong place to be posting this, just figured I might be able to get a medical opinion here. Thanks in advance! ",2024-11-11 22:39:28

Perineal Abscess?

So I had a bump on my perineum right at the entrance of the anus for 2 days now. Hurt like hell to sit up and sit down or wipe. I figured I got it from just over wiping too hard or something, but Today while wiping I noticed a “popping” sensation on the lump and out came a mountain of bloody puss. Felt super relieved because the pain went from an honest 8 while passive and 10 when sitting/standing/touching to basically now 0/10. The swelling is 90% down too. Should I keep an eye on it and go to my doctor if the pain/swelling returns or just go straight to my doc?",2024-11-12 02:21:43

I need help please. Over a month ago (Oct 8), a week after having covid I went to the hospital because I had head to toes pins and needles sensation. I felt it in my eyes, teeth, hands feet, you name it. This was followed by what started as only neck shoulder pain on my left side. I thought it was just a pinched nerve but the Dr said it couldn't be and proceeded with a head CT, never checked my shoulder. Head CT was cleared and I was put in Lyrica which did calm the pins and needles sensation and I was also referred to a neurologist but months could go by before I see an appt from them. 

After a month, the pain in my neck and shouldler have been consistent daily and will go down my left arm. Sitting and typing makes it worse, walking makes it better. The pain has been spreading down my spine to about halfway down my back where I'll feel tingled and numbness in the center of my back. If I wait too long to take the Lyrics, the pins and needles come back. 

I was still convinced it was a pinched nerve or even multiple pinched nerves until yesterday that I had a huge flare up. My whole body felt on fire with hot needles. I threw up and my head felt so much pressure. It was terrifying. I took my Lyrica (I had already taken the first dose earlier that day) and it calmed the nerves again but I've been having small spasms throughout my body now. The more my head feels pressure, the more the spasms occur (eyelids, arm, thighs, sometimes glutes). I have a CT for my shoulder next week but things are worsening quickly and I'm scared, especially that the head CT was cleared. Idk where to go from here. This is consuming my daily life and I just want to be normal and enjoy my days with my family again.

Any ideas or advice would be helpful 🙏🏽 ",2024-11-12 02:20:42

History of Autoimmune Hashimoto’s Disease, currently under control (TSH last checked in October) on 1MG Synthroid, brand name. No known allergies (have been tested for food allergies as recently as August). 

I started getting these little red scaly, itchy spots in the shower. Did not improve with time, got worse instead. I’ve been using a gentle body oil in the shower to penetrate the moisture barrier, then Lubriderm Advanced Therapy lotion, as well as a Goldbond eczema repair cream. It’s been over a month and there’s been no improvement. The skin is a little bumpy/rough (not like hives), and usually gets itchiest in a hot shower. It stings a bit with the eczema repair cream on it. Once the lotion dries and I’ve been out of the shower for a while, and my skin has been dry for a long time, the texture is still different: dryer, slightly raised. It hasn’t seemed to be flaky. 

Any leads? A visit with my GP will take months but thinking about asking the NP for a referral to a dermatologist soon, but I was majorly hoping to avoid steroid creams. ",2024-11-12 02:19:29
