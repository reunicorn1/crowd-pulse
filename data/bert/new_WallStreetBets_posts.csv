The TSLA hype didn't start last Tuesday, it started in July.

The stock price over the past four months, if you look at the results, pretty much went through a surge from $170 to $330, and actually nearly doubled, with a lot of volatility in between.



Luckily, I made the right bet, and I've been outperformed.

A lot of times, a sharp rise is often followed by a sharp fall; on July 19, 2023, TSLA tried to break through $300 unsuccessfully, and immediately came to a wave of turnaround and plummeted from $300 to $212 in one fell swoop; on July 11, 2024, TSLA tried to break through $270 unsuccessfully, and soon fell from $270 to $182 in one fell swoop.

If many options are near or in-the-money, market makers may need to buy large quantities of MSTR stock to hedge their positions. This hedging activity can lead to sharp price movements in MSTR stock.

Nov 26th - MSCI quarterly rebalance: MSTR's market cap increased from approximately 25.54B to 52.24B since the last MSCI review on August 12th, this could result in a higher weighting within the index. To reflect this change, more shares will be purchased by MSCI.

Nov 28th - Thanksgiving (orange-pilling): A holiday with family gatherings. Bitcoin and MSTR investors might discuss their recent profits resulting in an increase in interest for Bitcoin, and increase in retail adoption.

Nov 29th - QQQ ranking day: A snapshot is taken of the top 100 Nasdaq listed companies by market cap to determine which companies qualify to be added to the Nasdaq 100. Currently, MSTR is approximately 70th and therefore likely to be added.

Dec 10th - MSFT shareholder vote on Bitcoin: Microsoft will hold a shareholder vote to decide on whether to add an allocation of Bitcoin to their balance sheet. A vote for Bitcoin could result in increased demand, mainstream publicity, and further institutional adoption.

Dec 13th - QQQ addition announcement: It will be announced if MSTR is going to be added to the Nasdaq 100.

Dec 18th - December Fed meeting: A possible interest rate cut could have positive impact on MSTR/Bitcoin's price.

Dec 20th - QQQ rebalance: If MSTR is added to the Nasdaq 100 on this day, shares will need to have been purchased to reflect MSTR's weighting in the index. Passive buyers of the Nasdaq 100 will begin distributing money into MSTR.

Dec 24th - Jan 1st - Christmas / New Year's (orange-pilling): A holiday period with family gatherings. Bitcoin and MSTR investors might discuss their recent profits resulting in an increase in interest for Bitcoin, and increase in retail adoption.

Jan 17th - MSTR OI expiration: The expiration of a significantly large amount of in-the-money (ITM) open interest (OI) in MicroStrategy options contracts could trigger a gamma squeeze. If many options are near or in-the-money, market makers may need to buy large quantities of MSTR stock to hedge their positions. This hedging activity can lead to sharp price movements in MSTR stock.

Jan 20th - Presidential Inauguration: Donald Trump will become US President and may implement pro-Bitcoin policies and the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Increased regulatory clarity may have a positive impact on Bitcoin's price.

Jan 29th - January Fed meeting: A possible interest rate cut could have positive impact on MSTR/Bitcoin's price.

Feb 9th - MSTR Q4 / 10K earnings: Might offer insights into MSTR's Bitcoin purchases, holdings and strategy, potentially influencing MSTR’s stock price. FASB accounting could have a positive impact on earnings, although this is more likely to be implemented for Q1 2025 earnings.

Feb 11th - MSCI quarterly review: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index. A significant increase in MSTR's market cap could result in a higher weighting within the index. To reflect this change, more MSTR shares will need to be purchased by MSCI to rebalance.

Mar 3rd - MSCI quarterly rebalance: The index is rebalanced by this date.

Apr 30th - Russell index ranking day: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index. A significant increase in MSTR's market cap could result in a higher weighting within the index. To reflect this change, more MSTR shares will need to be purchased by the Russell index to rebalance.

May 5th - MSTR World: A 4-day event for MicroStrategy that may include Bitcoin related announcements which could have a positive impact on MSTR and Bitcoin price.

May 6th - MSTR Q1 earnings (FASB accounting): Implementation of FASB accounting rules will change how MSTR's Bitcoin holdings are reported, potentially releasing a net income gain of over $10 billion. Negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) over several previous quarters could be eradicated, qualifying MSTR for inclusion in the S&P 500. Investors may look to front-run S&P 500 inclusion, if they have not already done so.

May 13th - MSCI quarterly review: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index. A significant increase in MSTR's market cap could result in a higher weighting within the index. To reflect this change, more MSTR shares will need to be purchased by MSCI to rebalance.

June 2nd - MSCI quarterly rebalance: The index is rebalanced by this date.

TBC - S&P 500 inclusion: MSTR is currently ranked approximately 187th largest US company by market cap. If MSTR is added to the S&P 500, many shares will need to be brought to reflect it's weighting within the index.

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""  
..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming commercially 1sr qtr of 2025 in March / end of February. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; )

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info= 

link = https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/nvidias-high-end-arm-based-chip-for-pcs-will-reportedly-go-into-production-in-2025/

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""


And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial launch and anouncement will be in March, THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025...

So, I wanted to bet on Tesla mooning as a result of Trump winning due to their new close relationship, and the deregulation that was coming for Tesla in the new administration. I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!

So here's what I did:  
  
Bought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens... Rolled my weekly calls to 29 Nov/ 20 Dec and held till today. Closed 95%.",2024-11-11 15:34:23
WallStreetBets,1gpz82e,Despite Ridiculous P/E’s the Risk of not buying out weights that of buying ,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gpz82e/despite_ridiculous_pes_the_risk_of_not_buying_out/,26,"Only the brave who care for every penny they have will read this without complaining  of TLDR. A proper response will only make your personal case stronger.

I challenge you . 


Some  believe we’re seeing a repeat of 2021, when price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seemed irrelevant and the market was overly optimistic. While the current market does have a feeling of a ridiculous bullish sentiment( caught, cough NVDIA ) , the macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from 2021.

Today, things seem to once again be irrational, I agree to a certain limit . It’s difficult when  fan boys attempting to downplay the importance of valuation, P/E since they are ridiculously high, ratios still matter. 

HOWEVER.  Today is much more different then 2021 

Please  consider the broader context. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, including wars, have different implications now than in 2021. The Russia Ukrainian war was the only “invasion”  that did not see the market gain  some short time after.  Every other invasion was a buying opportunity.  Why ?


Back in 2021, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, which restrained the market’s ability to recover from geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time, we are in a much more stable environment, characterized by a decrease in interested rates with a robust American economy,  the exact opposite of 2021  in fact we are entering the prospects of cease fires much more rapidly. The possibility of escalation before rapid deescalation is possible. This is a typical  Trump tactic  

At the top of the list is the Trump Trade and what Tom Lee would refer to as the spirit  animal . The market may be in a golden pocket. 

How fast will this happen ? Look at 2017 - 

By January 29th trump had signed the biggest one thus far ; 

Executive Order 13771 —entitled ""Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs""— was an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on 

January 30, 2017

You can bet that with 4 years remaining he will have an even bigger once by that date leaving you only 60’days to buy whatever wallsteets leaves you with . 

This is why shorting the market is incredibly difficult . 

- trade wars are in other words increased business activities. No tariff is imposed without unleashing a furry of printing to help those affected by tariffs . A small percentage affected at the cost of billions printed - when they print cash you buy assets 
- Strong job reports
- Declining interest rates
- Falling inflation
- Invasion signal a buying opportunity the Middle East tensions have had zero impacts. 
- Rapid escalations and complete deescalation to the point where the underground war is completely ignored by media   
- Oil is nowhere near as impactful as it once  was in its golden days 
 - Emerging technological advancements related to AI and robotics- Let us be realistic that only few companies traded publicly that have more cabs then entire countries are at the top of this . TSLA’s and PLTRS price targets are no longer unrealistic considering the macro eagle view of the entire market and socioeconomic trends. 

These factors contribute to a sense of American economic exceptionalism. So, while it’s natural to be cautious, there are strong reasons to remain optimistic about stock market opportunities. 


I believe that the risk of missing out on buying shares outweighs the risk of investing during market dips. Just like the major tech companies have invested heavily in areas like chips, they ultimately need to deliver profits. However, the real danger lies in not investing at all.

Previous posts [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/YyXymG6gms) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/K7t0e15wj9). 

Now onto the big buck news, Neutron just signed its first deal to deploy two payloads of a new mega constellation with the possibility to deploy the whole thing. 

Neutron brings ≈7x on each launch more than its soon to be predecessor Electron : $55M against $8.5M per launch. 

What does this mean for the top line ? It means that in the launch service department they’re about to 7x every dollar they already bring and add even more contracts as medium launch is where most customers are. 

Some boring Macro analysis and what it means for $RKLB stock : 

- Rate cuts are coming in hot 
- Money rotation from giants to small and mid caps  
- Space sector trending strong 
- Donald Trump election = ease on regulation for space launch thx to Musk 

With these perfect market conditions and the growth potentiel for $RKLB (30% to 50% per year) we’re looking at a potential 50 PS ratio, and if euphoria takes the best of everyone more likely a 70 PS ratio. 

Which means $20B to $25B market cap = $40 to $50 stock price. 

Peace regards I hope you already made some tendies on this one.

And the U.S. is about to push through massive tax cuts and regulatory reform. The rocket has already made it to moon, now we're just refueling for Mars

So what's the play going forward? Well over the past week the one thing that will likely benefit most from deregulation has been almost flat. Natural gas. 

In the U.S., gas is cheap. Dirt cheap. It's basically a waste product from oil production at this point and we just burn the stuff at the wellhead because there's not enough pipeline capacity to get it to the customers.

Domestically, we are going to need a ton of energy for everything from data centers to manufacturing and there are no sources that can be brought on as fast as natural gas. So why haven't we expanded our pipeline capacity already? Simple, regulation has made the prospect of pipeline expansion unrealistic. But that's going to change. Unlocking oil and gas is expected to be a day 1 Executive Order. 

Internationally, the picture is looking even brighter. Turns out we're the only ones with dirt cheap natural gas. The rest of the world pays 10x or more what we do for natural gas. And now the U.S. wants to dominate energy exports. We are about to see LNG exports become a cornerstone of American trade policy.

WallStreetBets,1gpu26k,"Buy the $SPHR Dip, it's SPHERICAL! (Sphere Entertainment Co) - $1.4 million+ calls, insider buying, volume-based support, Stanford Prof DD",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gpu26k/buy_the_sphr_dip_its_spherical_sphere/,14,"SPHR (Sphere Entertainment Co) just had earnings this AM. There was a decent stock sell off today from a non-event/subpar earnings, but I saw over 1.4 million in net call option flow come in today during this dip. I've referenced research done by a Stanford Professor tons of times in this post.   
  
**Four sources of confluence here:**  
  
**1. Unique fundamental case highlighted by the research noted below**  
**2. More than 1.4 Million in net call option flow (institution(s) are betting big)**  
**3. Price is sitting at a volume-based key support level on the 1D chart**  
**4. Insider Buys by the CEO at prices higher than now**

**WTF is SPHR**  
Sphere Entertainment Co. (SPHR) is a unique entertainment company that owns and operates innovative venues, most notably the Sphere in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art immersive concert and event space designed for large-scale performances and experiences.  
  
**The Bull Case**  
Unlike traditional venues, Sphere owns 90%+ of its content, allowing it to keep most box office, concession, and ad revenue. Analysts may undervalue Sphere due to limited historical data, unconventional structure, and high operational leverage. The current market value might underestimate its potential. Key sources include live artist residencies, immersive experiences, corporate events, suite sales, and exterior ads.  A favorable MSGN loan renewal would enhance SPHR's cash flow, enabling strategic investments in Sphere expansion, content creation, and high-profile residencies, thereby fueling growth without immediate financial strain.

**The Bear Case**  
Limited events (16 concerts + UFC) impacted revenue potential; 25+ concerts per quarter needed for substantial profitability. U2 is not drawing large crowds, impacting anticipated revenue from residencies. Upcoming MSGN loan renewal decision is critical. If the renewal is unfavorable, SPHR’s financial flexibility could be at risk. The main risk remains in Sphere’s ability to scale events and navigate upcoming financing hurdles. Also it could keep continue a downtrend if this support doesn't hold. (which is why having a stop loss where the trade is invalidated is super important)

**Premium on Calls Activity**

SPHR 42.5 C 02/21/2025 - $1,115,812 - 92% ASK  
SPHR 40 C 12/20/2024 - $584,606 - 99% ASK  
SPHR 45c 02/21/2025 - $547,187 - 98% ASK

**Chart**  
Bottom wick into volume-based support indicates dip buying occurred today on 38-39. 

**Insider Buys**

    2024-03-04
    SPHR Dolan James Lawrence Exec COB , CEO P - Purchase $46.88 +110,156 645,060 +21% +$5,164,270 
    
    2024-02-28
    SPHR Dolan James Lawrence Exec COB , CEO P - Purchase $40.73 +76,139 534,904 +17% +$3,100,935 
    
    2024-02-26
    SPHR Dolan James Lawrence Exec COB , CEO P - Purchase $41.11 +59,374 458,765 +15% +$2,441,017 

**Additional Reading**  
Stanford Economics Professor & Investor Kevin L. Mak wrote a pretty awesome research paper on SPHR. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post the Google drive PDF here but search up ""A Deep Dive Into Sphere's Unit Economics And Valuation By Kevin Mak"".  
  
**My Position**  
I have 30 contracts of 45c 2/21/2025. I figured the longer expiry gave more time for the stock to recover and have additional catalysts such as additional residencies and the refinancing of MSGN play out.

**Disclaimer**  
NFA I could be totally wrong and have been wrong in the past. DYOR and DD.

2. 12-𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐏/𝐄 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨: Current share price divided by expected earnings for the next 12 months. Helps assess future growth.

3. 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞-𝐭𝐨-𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐤 (𝐏/𝐁) 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨: Market value compared to book value (assets minus liabilities). A ratio under 1 may suggest undervaluation

4. 𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐘𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝: Annual dividends per share divided by the stock price. Higher yields can indicate undervaluation and attract income-seeking investors.

Each metric is color-coded based on 15-year z-scores, and we calculate the average z-score of these four metrics and sort the countries accordingly.

However, Indian equities are facing challenges from weaker earnings and capital outflows.

- Undervalued Markets: Mexico, Colombia, and Hungary are seen as undervalued, benefiting from attractive dividend yields and lower P/E ratios.

The key point here is:  HIMS will ALWAYS have some sort of GLP1 and the cross sell is accelerating, new customers are spending more and more on their subscriptions!

This means a double down on GLP1 with a caveat to dodge lawsuits.  Dark Pattern tactics will ensure they maintain and grow sales in weight loss category.

FDA reconsidered removing the GLP1s from shortage in response to a compounder letter to FDA, decision will be next week but it's bullish that it was even taken seriously vs. big pharma's counter letters.  Most think this is going HIMS way.

RFK and Trump admin is historically anti FDA reg (announced policy) and specifically, ANTI NOVO (RFKs tweets have been slamming NOVO's profits on GLP1 constantly).

HIMS is projecting 90%+ growth in Q4...with now 2M users, 72% gross margin, and capturing 54% of all new telehealth customers...

HIMS IS what Teledoc could have been if they had ever been profitable and didn't flush $25B down the toilet.

HIMS is the future of telehealth.  This is AMAZON when they were just selling books.  The most operationally efficient platform (using AI to reduce cost of doctors with MedMatch) with the best customer experience.

As we reach escape velocity, price target is $60-100 EOY given the excellent macro environment, and this would only put HIMS at a pathetic 20B mkt cap or 10x PS ratio for a company that might be growing 100%+ rev. per year, with well over $2B rev next year...

We haven't even seen their reveal of testosterone replacement therapy yet, but adds being focused around low test means its coming.  Maybe Q4.

Here is the Fibonacci retracement from the last run from November 8th until today. It also looks like it is starting to come into an oversold scenario on the weekly chart. which all could be good signs.  The price has consolidated just below the 20 day moving average. 

https://preview.redd.it/tp67d09ord0e1.png?width=1717&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39372141042194b8886b95c7ec1e09fb20d7c8e

It looks like there is something similar for the monthly chart with the low on from October 31st. it bounced of the .68 line and started back up. it consolidated around .23 resistant line.  There has been a consolidation on the 20day moving average for the monthly chart too. 

My guess is that we may test the .50 weekly and then a run up to test 15.80 and if it pushes past that we have the previous high and then a significant move higher. 

then we will probably have a significant retracement with an opportunity to buy the dips if you are a long term holder of RKLB. If there is a chance for an option it would be a run up tomorrow during then a possible quick pop after hours. ",2024-11-12 02:43:30

With the influx of AI chips is all electronic and home appliances, demand for NVDA latest offerings are going to stay strong till the end of this decade.

Some of the applications of AI chips:

LLM Training Models
Data Centers
Cloud Computing
Enterprise computer systems
Home computers
Cars (latest EV and IC models)
Smart phones
Home appliances (televisions, refrigerator, washing machine, micro wave, oven-toaster-griller etc)
Home security systems & door locks
Home bots 
Industrial robots
Medicine and industry
Aircrafts and in airlines operations
Shipping
Minning
Inventory Management Tools
Police and Homeland Security
Cameras (Digital hand held, security camera etc)
Digital Wear (smart watches, smart glass etc)
Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Metaverse

The AI chip market is likely to explode from some 130 B$ market in 2025 to 500 B$ by end of 2029. 

Some research publications are pegging the AI chip market size estimate at 300 B$ by 2029, which in my opinion is too small considering the ever widening adoption of AI chip embedded products within industries, corporations, and households.

If AI chip market reaches 500 B$ by 2029 then this will mark a 3.85X increase in the size of the pie, with major chunk [baring any breakthrough by a competition] falling in the laps on Nvidia.

Charitably, let us say that NVDA is able to corner only 60% of the market in 2029 [from current 90%], that would mean annual revenue of 300 B$.

Say profit margins drop from current 60% to only 40% by 2029, this translates to 120B$ in annual profits.

Based on a reasonable P/E ratio of 40 [current is 69], the stock price by 2029 should be at staggering 343$ per share.

PLTR is a defense contractor specializing in leveraging data modeling and machine learning algorithms in vaguely-disclosed ways to assist the active and counter-intelligence agencies of federated Western nations, but primarily for the US government. You'll note the absolute rockets around every time that there was a news story announcing PLTR going into a contract for the US govt, and just recently when they went into that deal with Anthropic and AWS. Honestly fucking hilarious that Anthropic has a mission statement about not using AI to enable harm to human beings as they do a deal with a defense contractor but I'm here to make money, not make moral judgements. They should probably change that page though. P  
  
People see ""defense contractor"" and proceed to fully regard the stock as much as one can be regarded here in WSB. Full regard, I must emphasize. The reason that defense contractors are so lucrative isn't just because Uncle Sam has deep pockets.   Defense contractors are valuable for:

* Resale value: I can take an M16, a Humvee, or an AK-47 and sell it to some guy in some country that I can't pronounce, and he can go kill his nemesis with it. Is PLTR gonna resell their algorithms to General Butt-Naked? I seriously fucking doubt it.
* As above, emphasizing the black market aspect: The US military pays a premium on some completely ass hardware because they buy way too much of it to compensate for the fact that quite a bit of it is gonna fall off the back of a truck into that Yugoslavian terrorist cell.
* Long-term viability: I can kill you with a pistol made 100 years ago. A 20-year-old fighter jet is still a serious fucking problem for ground units. A 10 year old Humvee is still drivable and maintainable. But even a 2-year-old algorithm or model? The pace of software and model design is prohibitively expensive for the value you receive. You can't sell a 10 year old program, or most of the time even use the motherfucker with modern software.

  
And onto competition. Yes, right now PLTR has quite a lot of headway in the space of providing artificial intelligence leverage and data processing algorithms for intelligence communities, because that's their Brand, which is to say, digital blood money. More power to you, because christ knows that anybody who made enough money very quickly quit giving a fuck about the way they did it. But the assumption that PLTR has a huge moat is just flat fucking wrong. All the algorithms they use to predict behavior, or patterns in communication, or whatever-the-fuck else? ... literally just the same shit that digital ad providers are running.

  
You notice in their Anthropic and AWS deal that AWS is a digital ad provider? PLTR is soon to be challenged by any company who thinks to generalize their ad-driving software for intelligence reasons. If you can predict the size of the cock ring I'm gonna buy, I can only assume you can predict my next act of terror by my google searches. Is PLTR using some data-driving secret sauce that nobody has heard of? I really fucking doubt it.

  
PLTR is a good company that has mad great headway into their space. But they are not a 450% fair market valuation from fundamentals good. When people lose their hype for AI and it becomes just another industry revolution the way computers were, PLTR's revenue is getting its head bounced off the concrete. It's a matter of digital ad companies and improvement of code-assistant agents challenging what little moat PLTR has in the current market.

  
I'm not gonna hold you that my PLTR puts are absolutely fucking menstrual right now, but I'm buying LEAP puts when my broke ass saves enough from the cubicle farm. Let me reiterate: PLTR is a good company, maybe even a great one, but their moat isn't big enough for a 450% fair market valuation, and even if their moat were bigger, they don't have the same inherent profitability that the other defense contractors do. You can't steal a PLTR algorithm off a truck, or trade the quartermaster some smack for a few dozen rounds of data processing.",2024-11-11 22:28:02
WallStreetBets,1goxkm0,The Great Kohl's Catastrophe: Why Your Grandma's Favorite Store Is Doomed to Fail,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1goxkm0/the_great_kohls_catastrophe_why_your_grandmas/,78,"Once upon a time, in the golden age of department stores, Kohl's was the go-to destination for anyone seeking a reasonably priced blender, a pair of socks, and perhaps a lawn gnome—all in one trip. But alas, those days are fading faster than the color on a clearance-rack shirt after one wash. Let's dive into the hilariously inevitable downfall of Kohl's.

**1. The Amazonian Elephant in the Room**

In a world where you can order a drone to deliver your toothpaste within two hours, Kohl's seems as cutting-edge as dial-up internet. Amazon's meteoric rise hasn't just disrupted retail; it's drop-kicked it into a new dimension. While Kohl's has tried to cozy up to the giant by accepting Amazon returns in-store, it's basically like inviting a lion into your living room because you have a mouse problem.

**2. The ""Treasure Hunt"" Experience**

Kohl's stores are designed with the aesthetic of a labyrinth meets garage sale. Shoppers are expected to embark on an epic quest worthy of Indiana Jones to find that one item they didn't know they needed. In contrast, competitors like Target have streamlined, organized layouts that don't require a compass and a flare gun to navigate. Perhaps Kohl's is secretly training the next generation of explorers.

**3. Coupon Chaos Theory**

Kohl's is infamous for its mind-bending coupon strategies. With Kohl's Cash, percentage discounts, and mystery savings scratch-offs, checking out feels like filing taxes. According to Retail Dive, consumers are increasingly seeking straightforward pricing. But why make things simple when you can turn shopping into a Sudoku puzzle?

**4. Fashionably Outdated**

While other fashion retailers sprint to offer the latest trends, Kohl's appears showcasing styles that were all the rage when flip phones were cool. When was the last time you walked into Kohl's and seriously thought, ""God damn, this is fire"" Kohl's consistently presents a clothing line that can only be described as ""blah,"".

**5. Stock Market Slapstick**

Kohl's stock performance has been about as stable as a Jenga tower in an earthquake. Over the past five years, their stock price has seen significant declines. In September 2018 the stock was trading at near $80, now trading at a measly $18.  But wait, it gets juicier! The short interest in Kohl's stock has been notably high, signaling that investors are betting on the company's misfortune. It's like the stock market equivalent of people lining up to watch a train wreck in slow motion. Over 30% of Kohl's float was sold short. When a third of your investors are essentially rooting for your downfall, it's a tad suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

Unless Kohl's can reinvent itself faster than you can say ""super Saturday sale,"" it's headed for the retail graveyard, right next to Blockbuster and those weird mall pet stores. But hey, at least they'll have plenty of unsold inventory to keep them company.",2024-11-11 17:21:22

WallStreetBets,1gp6cnt,IonQ - The Hyperbolic Run Just Started,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gp6cnt/ionq_the_hyperbolic_run_just_started/,40,"Ladies and Gentlemen, let me explain to you why IONQ, though up 84%YTD, is about to start an explosive bull run.

**What is IonQ?** Backed by Industry Veterans from companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, Dell, Microsoft: IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company, developing a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.  Quantum computers will not take over traditional computers, but rather will exist alongside them.  For certain computational tasks, you currently need 2,500,000,000 GPUs worth of energy to solve what ONE Quantum Computer will be able to do near-term, an unbelievable saving in energy.  Explaining Quantum Computing as a whole would take several paragraphs, I encourage you to watch this beginner video if interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA) 

Quantum computers have just recently become more powerful than the worlds largest supercomputers for certain problems.

**Energy** \- With the rise in AI energy usage, we’re expected to double our energy consumption demands over the next few years.  Everyone seems to think building up a ton of nuclear reactors and power plants will be the solution to this new energy issue, but the CEO of IonQ disagrees.  He believes Quantum Computing can help AI drastically reduce its energy necessity. 

**AQ64, The Catalysts of all Catalysts** \- A task ran with AQ64 will use 18 Kilowatts of power, comparatively to **multiple billions** of kilowatts for an equivalent task on a GPU.   IonQ says reaching AQ64 will be a “ChatGPT” moment for Quantum Computing, equating to the recent AI boom of just a few years ago.  AQ64 is expected to release towards the end of 2025, but they have consistently CRUSHED target dates, beating their 2022 target date in 2022 by 2 months, 2023 by 7 months, and 2024 by 12 months.  AQ64 is coming sooner than we think.

**UAE x Quantum**: XPANSE QUANTUM is an exclusive forum taking place Nov 20-22 in Abu Dhabi, focusing on cultivating strategic relationships with 2,500 key global leaders in the UAE, and the GCC region.  Obviously they have a ton of money, and with the USA and China recently pouring billions into a new “Quantum Race”, it’s in their best interest to get involved.

**Elise Stefanik, UN 2025 and the “year of quantum”** \- Elise Stefanik was recently, as of 8 hours ago, appointed as UN Ambassador by Donald Trump.  Stefanik has close ties with IonQ [https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524) , and is a strong believer in the US beating China in the “Quantum Race”  Currently, the USA has only issued 1.2 Billion$ to be invested in Quantum over the next 5 years, while China has invested 15 Billion$.  So far, IonQ has received just 54.5M$ from the United States Air Force Research Lab… but that’s about to change…

The United Nations has proclaimed 2025 as the International “Year of Quantum Science and Technology”.  Elise Stefanik is the new UN Ambassador, wants to beat China in the “Quantum Race”, and the entire globe is about to accelerate Quantum development… Get it yet?

The last topic I will mention is Blockchain and Encryption being at threat due to Quantum Computing:  I don’t know enough of this, so I’ll quote one line and leave a link: “Quantum computers could potentially break current blockchain encryption, risking billions in cryptocurrency assets, according to a quantum policy expert.” [https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/)

**Why not other quantum companies?** Compared to other companies Algorithmic Qubits (AQ), IonQ has achieved near to ideal fidelity, AKA, their methods actually work, whereas other companies fail.  On top of this, IONQ has recently begun a spree of not only partnering with, but also acquiring multiple companies in a strategic play to make themselves a defining leader in this emerging sector. 

First came the CPU, then the GPU, next up: the QPU.  So far Quantum Computing has found Value in potential Market Sizes of up to $220 Billion USD, expecting to be in the Trillions in a few years.  None of this is financial advice, and do your own research.

WallStreetBets,1gobx7k,Why I am all in $MARA before earnings ,974,https://i.redd.it/uhpqb0tia50e1.jpeg,384,"Marathon Digital Holdings is a cryptocurrency mining company that primarily focuses on the mining of Bitcoin. I currently own 20,000 shares and some calls. Here’s why I am all in $MARA:

1. It has the most institutional buy in amongst all the BTC Mining companies. BlackRock owns 15.4%, Vanguard owns 12.25%. They both filed an increase in their positions recently at >100% and 57% respectively. 

Amongst all crypto related stocks, BlackRocks % ownership in $MARA of 15% is also its highest ownership.

2. Mara has the biggest HODL of all miners by a large margin. They have >27,000 BTC and the recent pump up to ~$80,000 per BTC will boost their profitability bigly. UPonly.

3. It has the highest hashrate of all BTC Miners which allows it to mine more BTC than all other miners. 

4. They own their own pool so they are technically the most “American Miner”. MADE IN USA is their slogan and seeing that Donald Trump might want to make America the top btc mining hub in the world, they might garner more support from Trump. (Mining CEOs met with trump fairly recently before the election day)

5. Many other miners have pumped up quite a lot but $MARA has stayed pretty stagnant. IMO it’s time for it to catch up with the rest (mean reversion / rotation back to the biggest btc miner).

6. If you believe in technical analysis, the chart is right under resistance and looking to make a move. 

7. It is the most shorted mining stock at 27% float. It seems like the perfect storm with BTC pumping over the weekend, earnings and it being right under resistance that shorts might get squeezed as they rush to buy back post weekend and before earnings come out.

These are just some of the reasons why I am hyper bullish on $MARA and have went practically all in (94% of my portfolio. 6% is on eth). See y’all after earnings on Tuesday 🫡 Wish me luck",2024-11-10 21:49:24

JPMorgan's reasoning was bullish on Novo Nordisk's upcoming December disclosure of study data on its weight-loss drug CagriSema...

JP Morgan's team of analysts, led by Richard Vosser, believe that the data will likely confirm that CagriSema has the “best in disease profile,” meaning that it has the best weight-loss effect of any weight-loss drug. They expect Novo Nordisk 's shares to rise at least another 10 percent if the drug really works that well.
The analysts predict that the market is most interested in the efficacy data from the REDEFINE 1 clinical trial, which will show that CagriSema has an average weight loss effect of up to 25.1%, which is better than the other two diet pills, Novo Nordisk Wegovy (14.9%) andEli LillyZepbound (20.9%). And, CagriSema's side effects (tolerability) would be about the same as Wegovy and Zepbound.
In addition, TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych has a Buy rating. In a report on Monday, he noted that CagriSema is well on its way to market and that the drug's main active ingredient, semaglutide, continues to be improved.",2024-11-11 18:51:24

You’ve seen the buzz around Archer Aviation (ACHR), but this isn’t just another stock to gloss over. These guys are dead serious about bringing flying cars to reality, and I’m all in with a solid position (I’ll reveal it later). Here’s why this might be the last chance to jump on board before it really takes off:

**Momentum is building up FAST**

Even after days of strong gains, ACHR is still pushing higher today, showing no signs of slowing down. This isn’t the time to sit back, short sellers are getting sweaty, and if this momentum holds, we could be in for a serious breakout. This kind of setup doesn’t come along every day.

**Major Partnership and Real Progress**

Like I mentioned in my previous posts here, Archer isn’t just another startup in a garage. They’re partnered with **Japan Airlines, Sumitomo, and even the U.S. Air Force**, with heavyweights like **Stellantis and Boeing** backing them. FAA certification is in progress—they’re hitting real milestones, not just putting out press releases.

And in a big step for international expansion, Archer just hired a leader based in Abu Dhabi to oversee development in the UAE. This new role is part of their strategic push to bring eVTOL to the Middle East and expand their footprint globally. With someone on the ground in Abu Dhabi, they’re clearly thinking big.

**Trump's Freedom Cities and eVOLT Vision**

With Trump pushing for “**freedom cities**” and futuristic tech, including flying cars, we could see big moves toward eVTOL infrastructure. If the U.S. government starts backing this tech, Archer’s set to be at the front of the pack.

**Strong Momentum & Interest from Big Players**

With major funds like Citadel and others taking positions on ACHR, this stock has some serious eyes on it. Retail interest is ramping up too, and if this momentum keeps building, we could see some exciting moves ahead. All the ingredients are here for something big, sitting on the sidelines might mean missing out.

**TL;DR:** I’m in on ACHR with a position I’ll reveal down the line (or to mods if needed). With partnerships, certification, government backing potential, international expansion in the UAE, and pressure from short interest, this setup is primed. This could be one of those last-chance moments before it truly takes off.

WallStreetBets,1gop2d3,MARA Stock: Technical Analysis Perspective,24,https://i.redd.it/llxn8v34090e1.jpeg,42,"Technical Analysis Perspective

I'll start by saying this: I'm not a fundamental analyst. Frankly, I don't really care about that aspect. 

My approach is rooted in looking at longer-term charts to identify trends. I don’t follow any single analyst, nor do I pay attention to what others might predict or what the indicators on their charts might suggest. 

Here's my thesis in simple terms:

1. Over the past year, the monthly chart shows the stock has been consolidating. 

2. The trend has been one of higher lows and higher highs. 

3. The lowest point during this period was around $14, with the peak reaching $34. 

4. The stock closed at approximately $19.25 last week and is currently trading at $22.73 in after-hours.

If the supply wall between $23 - $27 clears, the next logical target would be $34. Beyond that, we might see a significant short squeeze ignite.

This isn't gambling. It's about being positioned correctly based on chart analysis.

➡️ Keep an eye on earnings!!

It’s also worth noting that while I focus on charts, you do want to be aware of the underlying wind that’s moving crypto stocks. While I wouldn't say there's a direct correlation, the greed or fear in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can greatly affect the miners and thus, indirectly impact stocks related to crypto mining.",2024-11-11 10:18:11

Disclaimer: I’m long BE with shares and calls. This is not investment advice. 

I’m long on the stock based on my fundamental view and financial analysis of the company. Earnings last week were a disappointment to me. I’m still bullish, but was hoping to see more. Yet, the stock is up over 25% since then. I’ve been following the stock for over a year now, and my guess is that the high short interest has something to do with it—approx ~20% short interest. I’m guessing that since the earnings were not “catastrophic” that shorts are doing some covering. According to Fintel, very significant % of sales are short on a daily basis (ranges between 50% and 75% from what I can tell) so lack of real liquidity may be a reason why stock is so volatile? Wondering if any traders have any thoughts. Or anyone who is a short interest data nerd… is this time to take profits or ride the wave a bit? Curious what others think. ",2024-11-11 20:26:43
WallStreetBets,1goe5ux,Bullish on Riot / Bitcoin miners ,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1goe5ux/bullish_on_riot_bitcoin_miners/,70,"Let’s face it, prior to a month or two ago, it’s been pretty terrible for the Bitcoin mining industry. Across the board it almost all affected companies were down. RIOT in particular. 

But here’s Why I’m Excited About This Stock. Some of which applies to Bitcoin mining in general. 

 RIOT is on the move. The stock has surged to $12.64 this week with impressive trading volumes.

Key Points:

1. Massive Mining Infrastructure

RIOT operates some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the world, including the Corsicana site (with 600MW still under construction) and Rockdale (700MW). While other miners like IREN are planning large-scale sites, RIOT's operations are already up and running, and they’re far ahead in terms of scale.

2. Bitcoin Price Surge

Bitcoin is riding high, currently above $80,000 (and some analysts predict it could hit $100,000 by year-end). RIOT holds over 10,000 BTC, which means as bitcoin prices rise, so does RIOT’s asset base.

3. Future Goals

RIOT’s ambition to hit 100 EH/s by 2027 positions them as a leader in mining hash rate, further boosting their long-term potential.

4. AI Potential

What excites me even more is CEO Jason Les mentioning that RIOT is open to AI opportunities. With their massive mining facilities in Texas—close to key urban centers like Austin and Dallas, with access to cheap power and low latency—they’re perfectly positioned to pivot into AI workloads if the right deal comes along. The growing demand for GPUs in AI, paired with RIOT’s vast infrastructure, could make them a key player in this space as well. Jason has already mentioned they have received a lot of interest in this direction.

5. Political & Market Factors

With Trump returning to office, there could be major benefits for U.S.-based miners. Increased support for domestic bitcoin mining and the likelihood of regulatory changes to ease production could propel bitcoin—and in turn, RIOT—to new highs. As bitcoin rises, so does RIOT's profitability.

The Big Picture:
I’m not claiming RIOT is the only player to watch, but they’re certainly one of the biggest and in a strong position. With bitcoin price potentially reaching $100,000 in the near future, we could see RIOT’s stock easily hit $20-$25 by the end of the year, and $50+ if the market conditions continue to favor them.",2024-11-10 23:29:18

Can this be due to popularity? 

I’m not sure of everyone else, but I’m not very familiar with the name. It’s in my opinion that if Hindenburg were to have done the short report, there would have been legitimate consequences on the stock price. 

Anyways that’s beside the point. Carvana and its management continue to reap the benefits, selling their holdings.

There’s something going on underneath the hood. 

Carvana is a subprime predator lender and booking their only profits with the help of drivetime. Cars are being booked for well under their cost and loans are being sold for well above market value over to drive time, even though the 10k reports nothing of the sort. 

Perhaps because drivetime is a private company they can secretly fund this incredible growth.

That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\*\*

\*\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\*\*

\*\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\*\*\*

It is still the beginning stages of a monopoly an AI so strong that it is the basis for many experimental psychological studies . If you do not give your money to the AI it will make your life miserable.  Any nation that does not feed the beast, will be left behind. 


1T is not if, but when.  PLTR 


*THE EMPIRE WILL SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SUSTAIN ITS HEGEMONY*


Current holding mid xxx ( after selling regrettable 1/3 @ high 20s) currently very low teens average - You and I both know every dip will be purchased . But why ? 

America has been at war on average every 15-20 years .  The red white and blue will spend roughly 5-10% of  military spending into AI.   Likely more if China decides to hit the gas pedal . Undoubted they have already begun. 

With the current presidency will will likely entire a cycle of heavy reinvestment.  While most started investing, Palantir  was selling and training models at the highest levels of time sensitive data.   Why is this cycle crucial ? Because a reduction in conflicts allows PLTR to reassess and reinvest while being the only company with an actual framework of useful AI done at the highest levels and purest forms. 

Consider yourself lucky a 5% increase in institutional ownership and just few weeks gives it near 50% institutional  ownership .  The current macro environment of AI, economy and political situation tilt the  odds  in favour of continuous heavy investment and increased suits coming in. 

This is the only product that has retrained itself over many different models over decades that actually sold . 





This time we are in the brinks of a new Industrial Revolution. Now has never been the best period  to invest on any dip do not be afraid to get your feet wet, especially for those who are in this forever - since forever is my forever  holding period - on a company that has consistently maintained it’s promises quarter after quarter . It was never about the stock price when you knew they hit every goal . When without being gap profitable they told you why ( to pay talent ) and when they  would be. Never once did they ever not do what they said they would . 

To sustain an empire, significant investment is required. Alex Karp and Peter Thiel, both staunch capitalists who champion Western values and American exceptionalism, are key figures in this endeavor. Their interviews reflect their commitment to these principles.

The lack of a viable alternative to capitalism is evident; no other system has lifted more people out of poverty. From fascism to extreme socialism, alternative systems have historically failed. For instance, Mao’s socialist policies in China caused the deaths of over 20 million people, Stalin’s communism led to famine and political purges, and fascism has also proved disastrous. Despite its flaws, capitalism and democracy more precisely **republic democratic meritocracy** have shown more promise in advancing human progress than any other system.  You could never In your own mind give me a PROVEN system that has worked better or tested time . 

Go ahead . Stop here and think . What proven system has worked better ( tech advancement , medical , agriculture , space etc ) and tested time ? Take 2 minutes to think or continue reading.  

Although not perfect and has blood on its hands , it is clearly the lack of better proven alternative. 

**What you want is monopoly** - Peter Thiel 


With a rapid advancement of China and what some believe it is the peak of the American Empire - we are reminded of this by experts like Ray Dalio . **The empire will
Spend whatever to stay at the top.**
Now With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and shifting global dynamics, the U.S. will need to invest heavily in AI to maintain its edge. This necessity underscores Peter Thiel’s belief in the importance of maintaining technological supremacy. Palantir, with its unique position in AI, faces no direct competition, Really no competition within government can even come close to bring such projects to life .  Private enterprise has done better in American history  at taking care of the biggest wars and domestic affairs. Why ? Because government doing it themselves has historically failed .

Free enterprise is much more feasible for government to hire . Much more productive and resourceful, making it crucial for the U.S. to stay ahead. If the current leaders do not act decisively, rivals like China could surpass them. This advcement converts into proven “bootcamps”  or experience that develops to its population through enterprise. Papantir was not kidding when they said it would happen faster rather than later.

WallStreetBets,1gm4gzv,YOLO $35k into 1.1MM to save the family farm. ,11965,https://i.redd.it/hqt0lf2xdkzd1.jpeg,1581,"Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.

Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad’s income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.

I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It’s where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. 

I’ve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it’s an idiot move but it’s the only chance I have at this point and I’m 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. 

The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I’m willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. 

Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. 

Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won’t sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. 

TLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun.

WallStreetBets,1gn7izc,BTC Analysis pt. 2 (pt. 1 is linked),12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/nQ8IAvzewE,34,"
Disclaimer:

I own some of the stocks mentioned and make this post to understand how you guys feel about btc.

My positions:
1700 shares of MARA (~$32000)
80 shares of MSTR (~$21000)

Recap of my last post:

In the last cycle, MSTR pumped 800% and MARA pumped 2500%. I don’t expect the same volatility this year, but stocks in the sector, including the ones mentioned, are gaining momentum. Stocks with large Bitcoin holdings will pump first (as MSTR is currently doing) and stocks like MARA will have the opportunity to pump strongly due to it being shorted heavily.

Current Golden Opportunity:

1. Donny T in office

This shift is going to be a crucial factor in the BTC bullrun. Currently, the chair of SEC Gary Gensler is a menace to crypto, as heavy regulatory moves are handicapping it’s potential. With pro crypto Donny in office, we will see a swift shift to a pro bitcoin environment. The next point highlights the institutional reaction to this…

2. Heavy institutional buying

Heavy institutional buying is taking place. In fact, following the election, the likes of BlackRock are now DOUBLING down on their BTC holdings. BTC is now at an ATH and no one is talking about it. So what does that mean? Giga whales are the ones currently moving BTC. Retail investors show no interest. And that brings me to my next point.

3. Retail has yet to enter

BTC sees its volatility when retail investors flock in by the millions because BTC is pumping. BTC is currently at ATH thanks to institutions and retail is silent. What does this mean? BTC‘s notorious bullrun has barely started (google trends is showing growing retail interest) and the sky’s the limit.

Questions to you guys:

I’ve been scouring this page for pro BTC posts but have been surprised by the low interest. Could you guys give me your take on why this is? Have you just not been aware of these major catalysts? Or is it too volatile for you? I understand if the general public may be „scared“ to get into BTC but you people are degenerates like myself so I’m not completely understanding why no one here is betting on this.

If you are in the space, what’s your exist strategy? Personally, I will be looking at retail greed to gauge when to sell.

The larger the spike, the larger the correction, though I still think it'll be just a correction for the time being as the mood is currently bullish.

I've had very similar problem in the past, during the known meme stock squeezes, the $OSTK and $TRUP surges...and I've always made money, but I never nearly maxed out, i.e. I've always exited too early.

Not to complain and not implying $COIN will end up like $OSTK...but it is clearly blown up on fundamentals 9 out of 10 times when that happens the stock normally goes down over time.

Two other major reasons I don't think $COIN will be a unicorn are 1) it does not have IP to guard its business; crypto in general is designed as a decentralized concept with public know-how of making it work, which means the more the market matures the higher the competition and there's nothing pushing profits down as well as competition. I don't see that changing in $COIN's favor; and 2) Warren Buffer and Charlie Munger, to both of whom I have great respect, had long said crypto would eventually come to a crash. May take 5, 10 or 50 years and may be irrelevant in the current context, but those two have seen and done way more than I'll ever see and do, so for me it's just a common sense to listen to them.

WallStreetBets,1gm84at,Are we delusional about the economy?,900,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gm84at/are_we_delusional_about_the_economy/,637,"I think the markets are frothy, and we have been going through mini-cycles which raise and lower sentiment almost on a weekly basis, drifting further and further away from fundamentals. Earnings releases, tax cuts (elections), lower rates, etc. - there are endless catalysts. The stock market has become a casino. In my opinion, this all started during COVID with the influx of retail investors (and the boom of this sub) and while we've gone through a ""recession"" and down-markets, the excitement around the stock market is at an all-time high, as are valuations. I've mapped out the last 20 years and have taken a *very simple* approach. I know there are a ton more considerations, so please note any large ones I may be missing. Below is a table I put together in excel, and some explanation on each factor mentioned - when you step back, it looks like we're due for a major reset on valuations.

**TLDR (Takeaways from the table):**

**S&P500 Valuation.** Even though I don't like P/E ratios (in favor of EV/EBITDA), I'll use it as most folks here are more familiar with it. P/E ratios have been around \~20x, and we are currently sitting at 30x. Looking back even further, they used to hover around the 10-20x P/E range. Yes, all companies are growing, so the S&P500 should too. But the growth in valuations is outpacing economic growth (see below). Larger and faster-growing companies deserve higher valuations, so this can be *part* of the reason, but current levels seem to be a stretch, especially if you compare it to actual GDP growth.

**GDP Growth.** This is one I've been focused on lately. Nominal GDP in the US has gone up 2.4x over the last 20 years, yet the S&P500 has gone up 5.1x (total stock market went up 3.7x). Nuances: (1) international revenue of American companies is not in GDP, however the % of foreign revenue in the S&P has remained steady over the last 10-20 years. (2) this doesn't factor in private companies, IPO trends, de-listings, etc. Nominal GDP compares well to S&P500 as both are unadjusted for inflation.

**CPI Index.** ""Inflation has come down, yay!"" The *rate* has come down. Many folks expected deflation after 2022, to restore prices, however that never happened. We're at *higher* prices than 2022. Inflation has picked up 34% over the last 10 years, vs. 24% in the preceding 10 years. Maybe this is the new norm, but it's all factoring into the revenues the S&P companies are generating, and thereby, the valuations.

**National Debt.** I'm not an expert at this category, but we're adding on more national debt at a record pace as well. Most PPP loans were forgiven, credit is cheap (again), so if we keep adding here, when does the circus stop?

Edit: I updated real GDP to nominal GDP below to reflect a more accurate comparison, but the punchline still stands - the S&P has far outpaced it, especially comparing the last decade to the decade before.

Facility in Georgia is almost ready to roll. They’re aiming to start production in early 2025, with a goal of **two aircraft per month** by year-end. Not mass production yet, but big progress in the eVTOL world.

**FAA Certification Milestones** ✅

They’re in **Phase 3** of FAA certification, with the final phase (Phase 4) coming up. Once they cross that, they’re good to start commercial flights. This isn’t just vaporware they’re actually hitting the steps to get this thing approved.

**Big Partnerships and $6B+ in Orders** 💸

Just signed a **$500M** deal with Japan Airlines & Sumitomo, plus a UAE air taxi partnership with Abu Dhabi Investment backing. Total order book is over $6 billion. Big names are showing up and putting real money on this tech.

**So, What’s Next?** 📈

After a strong move the day before, Archer’s up another 14% post-earnings—serious momentum building here. The price action shows solid investor backing for the progress they’re making. With big partnerships, production on the way, and FAA approval within reach, the fundamentals are aligning for a strong long-term play. Plus, with high short interest still in the mix, there’s real potential for a squeeze if this momentum keeps rolling.

**TL;DR**: Real moves from Archer manufacturing lined up, partnerships stacking, and certification on track. Long play potential here if they keep this up.

From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

WallStreetBets,1gne1e0,TSLA Potential Bearish Next Week,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gne1e0,144,"Next week look at potential bearish TSLA crash

Tesla’s recent price action suggest a possibility of a pullback, potentially to the $307 level, before moving up to the $335 range. Analysts have noted that Tesla’s RSI is over 80, placing it in an “overbought” category, which often leads to a temporary pullback as investors take profits. Additionally, technical indicators show that the stock may face resistance near $335, suggesting it may first need to “cool off” with a slight dip before any attempt at higher levels.

If Tesla does pull back to around $307, it could serve as a consolidation phase, allowing the stock to gather momentum for a push upward. However, this movement is contingent on overall market conditions and investor sentiment staying supportive. Some sources view this pullback as a healthy correction within Tesla’s ongoing uptrend, while others suggest that breaking below $307 could trigger further declines.

In summary, a pullback to around $307 is likely, but it should be monitored closely, as further decline would indicate potential support level testing around $288. 

While it’s difficult to predict Tesla’s exact movements over the next week, there is some consensus among analysts that the stock could face further volatility.

The price is currently above $320, with analysts having varying opinions about where it could go in the near future. Some predict a potential pullback to the $220–$250 range, particularly considering concerns about profitability and broader market conditions. Other more optimistic forecasts suggest that Tesla could eventually see a rebound, with some price targets as high as $350, but this would be contingent on Tesla maintaining strong market position and positive news, such as advancements in their self-driving tech.

Given these mixed views, while a pullback to around $230–$240 is possible, it is equally plausible that the stock might stabilize around the $300 mark or rise, depending on the broader market trends and company performance.

Market hype is dying down after this past week, people are taking out profits and we are looking at a big potential dip in the stock. Overvaluation and Tesla having a bad year so far if we talk sales and production; the uptrend is most likely over and if you haven’t already this could be a good time to sell. The risk is way too high for minimal profit margins.

(It all depends on how much Elon Musk will post on Twitter/X lol)

WallStreetBets,1glrz84,🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀,1408,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1glrz84/achr_on_the_rise_7_today_and_new_partnership_with/,146,"**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.

**Why the New Japan Deal Matters**

Archer's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.

**Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**

ACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.

**Key Graphs to Watch**

* **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure.
* **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same.
* **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector.
* **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.

**Final Thoughts**

Archer is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.

They just dropped their Q3 results, and despite all the noise, they’re **CRUSHING IT** on their turnaround plan. They’re exiting their money-losing eCommerce biz, slashing costs, and optimizing cash like legends. 

The juicy part? They raised their full-year Adjusted EBIT guidance to $355M-$360M, and if you slap a modest 15x multiple (where their peers trade) on that, we’re looking at an equity value of around **$3.5 BILLION**. That translates to a target price of **$19.63 per share**. This bad boy’s currently trading at **just $8.05**. Easy double over night. 

This ain't just hopium. They’ve been deleveraging like pros, bringing $117M back home from overseas, and stacking cash like they’re prepping for a hostile takeover.

**Globalstar Q3 Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Beat**: Globalstar exceeded expectations with $72.3M in Q3 revenue, 19.5% above the $60.5M estimate, driven primarily by high-margin wholesale capacity services.
* **Record EBITDA**: Adjusted EBITDA rose 34% year-over-year, reaching a record high and signaling improved operational efficiency.
* **FCC Approval**: The FCC granted a 15-year extension, allowing Globalstar to operate up to 26 additional satellites, supporting long-term service capabilities and growth potential.
* **Emergency Service Resilience**: Maintained reliable service during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, demonstrating the robustness of their satellite network in critical conditions.
* **Apple Partnership**: On November 1, Globalstar announced an expanded $1.1 billion partnership with Apple to support satellite-to-cellular connectivity for iPhone 14 and newer models. This service, known as Emergency SOS via satellite, allows iPhone users to send text messages to emergency services when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage by connecting directly to Globalstar's low Earth orbit satellites. This crucial feature provides users access to emergency help even in remote areas. The expanded agreement includes an equity stake for Globalstar and is set to enhance the capacity and reliability of the Emergency SOS service, strengthening Globalstar's presence in the consumer tech and satellite communications space.

**Summary**: With strong financials, strategic partnerships, and regulatory approvals, Globalstar is well-positioned for sustained growth.

This materialized as DAL and UAL continued their rally, with DAL up another 30% to 60 since my previous DD, primarily driven by US election results and the Trump Trade.  

With the upcoming holiday season, tourism and air travel are at the top of mind – DAL and UAL are two domestic airlines best positioned on international, premium, and holiday travel. While UAL offers more INTL, DAL leads in premium and reliability, which are essential for vacation trips. 

To get ahead of the holiday season, we aim to gain insight and forecast holiday travel demand and color on air travel going into 2025. With the recent election, recent MAR, ABNB, and EXPE earnings, and shifting macro trends, this post will focus more on forecasting and market dynamics rather than idiosyncrasies within the AI and DAL. We will project air travel demand and other factors affecting air travel and justify a bullish position on DAL going into Investor Day 2024 on 11/20. 

 

Outline 

* US Election Impact on Travel Demand, the Airline Industry (AI) 
* Macro and industry trend implications for DAL 
* MAR, ABNB, EXPE earnings and guidance implications for the AI 
* Analysis of DAL's current positioning, performance, and upcoming catalysts 
* My Positions 

US Election, Trump Trade Impact on Airline Industry (AI) 

Largely under the radar, the AI is part of the larger Trump Trade due to the following factors (https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-interest-rate-inflation-today-11-07-2024/card/heard-on-the-street-trump-makes-airlines-great-again-but-why--F7MJW5QDNenQ6RoKscio) 

* Green light for M&A (Spirit and JetBlue) to transform the AI landscape 
* Deregulation for AI, 2016 precedent 
* Falling energy and oil prices with increased US production, 2016 precedent 
* Ending wars in Ukraine, the Middle East part of 2024 campaign promise 
* Fiscal policy to boost economy and both consumer and corporate spending, driving air travel demand 
* Tariffs and other fiscal policy to strengthen the dollar, boosting INTL travel (https://www.marcus.com/us/en/resources/heard-at-gs/what-a-strong-us-dollar-means-for-travel) 

 

Macro and Industry Trends Continue to Favor Airlines  - FED, EXPE earnings, ABNB earnings

* Cutting interest rates globally to boost economic activity continuing into the foreseeable future a tailwind for high-leverage industries such as the AI 
* EXPE air revenue up 4% YoY in Q3 compared to 0% in Q2 and 1.7% in Q1, highlighting positive trends 
* EXPE air bookings up 7.8% YoY in Q3, compared to 6.6% in Q2 and 1.4% in Q1 
* EXPE cited strong air bookings as a main driver for Q3 performance 
* EXPE raises FY24 outlook, citing growth and opportunities abroad despite previous travel demand concerns 
* EXPE total B2C revenue down 1.4% YoY in Q3 more than offset by 18.4% B2B revenue increase YoY 
* Mild B2C Q3 revenue decrease does signal travel softness, but combined with air revenue increase strengthens thesis for increasing shift to longer distance, INTL vacation travel 
* ABNB earnings gives insight into travel demand, global 
* ABNB Q3 revenue up 10% YoY 
* Strong performance in core markets (US, Canada, Australia, UK, France) represents 75% of business 
* Sees strong opportunity in expansion into other global markets, bullish sign for INTL travel 
* ABNB performance less informative than EXPE on the AI 

 

Current DAL Performance, Positioning, and Upcoming Catalysts 

DAL and UAL are industry leaders well-positioned for the upcoming holiday travel season. I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:

* DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total 
* Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown) 
* Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue 
* Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends 
* Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends 
* Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers 
* AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop 
* CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20 
* Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends 
* Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively? 
* Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins 
* Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections  

Throughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3). As a tangent: potential upcoming trade opportunity will be comparing actual TSA check-in data during the winter months and trade off the spread between current AI optimism on Q4 travel and modeling what the actual data represents.

Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump’s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.”

WallStreetBets,1gmzju3,"Hear me out, hear me out (TSLA)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gmzju3/hear_me_out_hear_me_out_tsla/,51,"So Elmo was on a call today with The Donald and Zelensky. 🥭 may have been negative in the past about EVs, but Elon has to have a deal in place - most likely to tariff international EVs so that Tesla wins bigly. But, we all know this. Tesla smashed it this week. Am I pissed I missed it? Yes. Am I looking inwards for losing 30% this week, when the market rallied and a young degen chimpanzee could’ve made money? Absolutely. Do I think on Monday I will be buying the Tesla top? Absolutely not. 

I think there is another catalyst for Tesla. Fuck the election, fuck the new administration. That’s yesterday’s news. I’m talking Russia. 

We’ve seen Elon and Putin in headlines recently. Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China. But unlike Sleepy Joe, Trump, a fan of Elon, and seemingly friend of Putin, will not give a shit about this communication. With the prospect of at least a ceasefire, if not all out end, to the war in Ukraine looking likely, I believe this opens up trade with Russia again. But this is where it gets interesting. We have an inside man. Elon is first in the running to reopen business in Russia. He is the business face of this administration, and I believe his targets will be set on the Russian automobile market potential. 

Some stats I have found:
- The Electric Vehicles market in Russia is projected to reach a revenue of US$2,470.0m in 2024.
- The market is expected to experience an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 18.09%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,673.0m by 2029.
- By 2029, it is estimated that unit sales of Electric Vehicles market in Russia will reach 61.94k vehicles.
- In 2024, the volume weighted average price of Electric Vehicles market in Russia is expected to be US$89.9k (Elmo can sell for cheaper)

Feel free to collectively shit all over me in the comments, but can you really say to yourself this is farfetched? I don’t think so. Elon will do Elon things. This is a PR and economic win for him - be one of the faces associated with ending a war, and be one of the leaders in re-intergating Russia into the global economy.

* $TOST is currently at an RSI of \~67, so it's almost overbought - but not quite yet.
* $TOST only started getting profitable last quarter, so there's a high expectation for that to continue, and I think they will. Summer and fall are the most popular times for newer restaurants to open.
* $TOST has broken through resistance of $32.35 today, and a close over this number is a strong indication that we will continue in an upward trend even with ""just ok"" earnings.

I'm not expecting much if $TOST beats earnings - maybe a healthy 5%-8% pop and a continual push tomorrow. If it's an earning miss, then we're likely looking at a similar fall of 5%, but I feel it will still add some recovery on Friday/Monday. Price target of $34-$35 after earnings, and if earnings are good, $42-$44 by EOY.

My position is 500 shares @ $31.94 and 5 Jan 17 calls @ $3.70

Of course, my degenerate self would have made 2 grand now if I just held on to my position. 

Bought 100 shares of BA while it was under $147 yesterday thinking the bottom must be near and the company is now on a path to recovery. Hopefully sooner rather than later. Not long after I pulled the trigger, I saw in my history that I had bought this back in 2020 at $147 and then sold it at $222 10 months later. I have a good feeling that in a few months, BA is going to turn things around and be trading somewhere above 200s again. 

Of course, this isn't financial advice. Don't YOLO anything based on my assumptions. Just looking for like-minded degenerates for any insights here. What are your thoughts?
