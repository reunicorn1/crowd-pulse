They might look pretty for a photo OP but they're terrible if you actually want to watch the game.

I'm not sure if the players themselves are bothered by it, probably not, but it's a big hassle watching on TV. Last year it was only part of the court that was painted over, I thought it might be better this year if they paint over the whole thing, but they just made it worse.

nba,1gpsxkj,"[MacMahon] Klay Thompson: ""I've seen some of my favorite athletes pivot and have tremendous success. When I think of Shaq(uille O'Neal) leaving the Lakers and winning a ring or Tom Brady winning one with Tampa Bay, it's been done before.""",2047,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gpsxkj/macmahon_klay_thompson_ive_seen_some_of_my/,267,"Thompson chose the Mavericks over the Los Angeles Lakers, who also recruited him in free agency, because he believed Dallas provided him the best chance to pursue a fifth championship ring. He believed he could be the missing player after the Mavs, fresh off their five-game NBA Finals loss to the Boston Celtics, promised him a starting spot. He craved the opportunity to prove that, at 34 years old and with two major injuries on his medical records, he could still play a major role on a contender.

""Honestly, it's rejuvenated me and done something I needed bad just for my mental and my career,"" Thompson said. ""So, I really feel the love here, and I feel highly valued that I can do great things.""

SCOTTIE PIPPEN CAME to mind as Thompson was coming to terms with his decision to eliminate the possibility of returning to the Warriors.

Thompson lights up when he talks about when Pippen, a six-time champion as Michael Jordan's co-star with the Chicago Bulls, signed with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1999. Thompson was 9 at the time living in Portland, where his father, Mychal, played for the first eight years of his career after the Blazers selected him No. 1 in the 1978 NBA draft. Thompson was ecstatic that the local team had added such an icon, one of his favorite players from childhood.

""That was like the best day of my life,"" he said. ""That was so amazing.""

Pippen was 34 at the time, the same age Thompson is now. While Pippen wasn't able to earn another ring in Portland, his success there serves as inspiration for Thompson.

""He did a lot for the Blazers. They were three minutes away from a Finals appearance,"" Thompson said in reference to Portland's Game 7 loss to the Lakers in the 2000 Western Conference finals.

Pippen had a bridge season with the Houston Rockets between the Bulls being broken up after ""The Last Dance"" championship run and his arrival in Portland. Pippen also had hard feelings toward his original franchise that Thompson is adamant he does not hold for the Warriors -- no matter how uncomfortable he felt at times in his final season with Golden State.

""I'm so grateful for everything I experienced at Golden State,"" Thompson said. ""But I mean, **I've seen some of my favorite athletes pivot and have tremendous success. When I think of Shaq\[uille O'Neal\] leaving the Lakers and winning a ring or Tom Brady winning one with Tampa Bay, it's been done before.**

He may establish a legal guarding position inside the Restricted Area if the offensive player received the ball inside the lower defensive box or he is the primary defender. If the defender does not get into a legal guarding position before contact occurs, it is a blocking foul on the defender. If he gets to a legal guarding position before contact occurs, it is an offensive foul. Of course there are exceptions, such as when an offensive player leads with a foot or knee.

7/20 FG

4/10 3P

14/16 FT

Gradey Dick was drawing a ton of fouls from the Bucks in what ended up being a career high number of trips to the foul line with 16 in total.  His aggression tonight stood in complete contrast to his timid start as a rookie, getting 22 points at halftime and singlehandedly mounting a turnaround to start the 3rd quarter before poor team shooting, a cold 4th quarter from Gradey and one of RJ's worst games in recent memory sunk their chances of an upset win.

To put this into perspective, the whole Bucks team only shot 12 free throws to Dick's 16.

You’re right, though. Those macro decisions, which were so widely celebrated at the time, have now put them in the kind of nightmarish position that has quickly become a cautionary tale for other teams.

>They are, in essence, officially stuck in second-apron hell.

>As I wrote in this recent piece about Paul George and his LA Clippers exit, any team above the collective bargaining agreement’s second-apron luxury tax threshold ($189 million this season) better be sure the star players who put them there pan out. If they don’t, as the Bucks’ situation would seem to indicate at the moment, then the litany of roster restrictions that come with the second-apron life are such that teams have virtually no way to escape. You are no longer allowed to aggregate multiple player contracts to make trades, which means the front-office phone goes quiet in the kind of way that has to feel quite hopeless. One-for-one deals are still possible, but the scenarios to sift through that might help a team like Milwaukee survive here are far fewer than all of the non-second apron teams.

>I could certainly see the Bucks doing some kind of deal, if not more than one, before the Feb. 6 deadline. But in terms of the big stuff that comes with their team’s calculus — Giannis, Dame, Doc and Khris — I don’t see anything changing. **For those asking about whether Rivers could be on the hot seat, let’s not forget the Bucks paid him approximately $40 million on a three-and-a-half-year deal less than a year ago. What’s more, Horst is facing pressure because of how these past few seasons have gone, and league sources are skeptical he’d be given the leeway to make another coaching change this soon.**



>With that in mind, I’ll leave you with this: What if this sort of play continues? Is anyone going to be in peril in season, or does it become a situation where it all gets resolved in the summer. We all know what the noise might look like at that time if that’s the case.

>**The Giannis talk around the league would be front and center, but questions about Lillard’s long-term wishes would be a focal point as well. Horst showed serious interest in the Detroit Pistons job last summer, only to be denied permission by the Bucks. So what does his future hold? There are rival executives who wonder if Rivers might wind up in the Bucks’ front office down the line. They can fix all of that messiness by winning, but that’s proving to be quite the challenging task.**

2020 draft - It is obviously Ant. (Lamelo is good but have some injury concerns. And Ant was definitely better this decade so far.

2022 draft - Obviously Paolo is the best player. (With Chet a solid second)

2023 draft - Wemby Clears

However, in 2021. There is no consensus best player in the draft yet.

Is it Alperen Sengun or Evan Mobley? Young rising bigs?

Or is it the #1 Pick that year in Cade?

Is Franz in consideration?

Or maybe it is Scottie Barnes who his coach said is a Future Superstar soon?

Which of them has your both so far as best player in 2021 Nba draft?

For me, it is Scottie Barnes.

nba,1gpvbfc,Jusuf Nurkic has a 7% assist rate vs 25% turnover rate so far this season.,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gpvbfc/jusuf_nurkic_has_a_7_assist_rate_vs_25_turnover/,13,"Just something I noticed I found humorous. He's also as usual sub-60% from the paint. But his efficiency is actually in line with his career norms because he's taking more 3's and not shooting disastrously bad at them. Not good, 31% isn't good and he's had a couple hot games that masks that most games he's been very inefficient from 3. But it's enough along with he getting to the line more to boost his efficiency to around career norms. Taking more efficient shots. But he will always be frustrating.

What do you all think about the season Nurk has had thus far and do you think the Suns should be seeking an upgrade with urgency? I think we all know they can probably do better than Nurk but how urgent do you think that is for them, and how much better....if at all?",2024-11-12 20:59:03

nba,1gpgwj5,Nikola Jokic currently has a BPM (Box Plus Minus) of 15.1,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gpgwj5/nikola_jokic_currently_has_a_bpm_box_plus_minus/,126,"Here is some context:

Box Plus Minus estimates the points per 100 possessions a player contributed when compared to the league average player.

A score of 0 means you contributed 0 points more than the average player, currently the only person with a score of 0 is Jeremey Sochan (Spurs) and he is ranked 93rd in this metric.

The second highest score is Anthony Davis, with 8.7.

The gap (6.4) from Jokic (1st) to AD (2nd) is the same as from AD (2nd) to Wemby (47th)

If Jokic keeps this up he will beat the previous best BPM regular season score which is currently 13.72, held by Nikola Jokic.

Also, Jokic currently (not counting the current season) holds 4 of the top 6 highest BPM seasons, the remaining two being held by LeBron and Jordan.

And yes i know you guys are getting tired of hearing how great Jokic is but ill keep singing his praises until he wins the MVP this season.",2024-11-12 09:25:08

nba,1gpn14k,Agent Bernard Lee on the decline in the number of veteran players on NBA rosters: “This is a direct result of 2 ways which are by far the worst thing we do.  2 ways should not exist in any way shape or form and have been totally exploited by the teams”,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gpn14k/agent_bernard_lee_on_the_decline_in_the_number_of/,37,"[Tweet](https://x.com/bernieolee/status/1856344206375112715?s=46&t=hdMYR5VNI3D4hupTVErxeg)

> This is a direct result of 2 ways which are by far the worst thing we do.  2 ways should not exist in any way shape or form and have been totally exploited by the teams and not only have we let them do it we added a 3rd one to each teams roster.

Lee is most notably Jimmy Butler’s agent. 

His hardline stance on 2-ways is not surprising, as 2-ways in most cases mean less guaranteed contracts, less roster spots for the veteran players they represent, and less commission for agents, but it’s ironic that his most important client plays for a team that has frequently used 2-way contracts to develop rotation players like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent.",2024-11-12 15:17:32

nba,1gpux1r,Which player's early struggles do you buy as being legitimate and not a slow start?,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gpux1r/which_players_early_struggles_do_you_buy_as_being/,63,"As the NBA nears every team hitting their 10th game of the 2024/25 season, we've gotten a glimpse into both intruiging talent like the rise of sophomores Bilal Coulibaly and Gradey Dick, as well as bouncebacks from the likes of Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins...and some returning faces who have not had a terrific start to their seasons.

It's obviously too soon to definitively say that a given player is washed or is on the decline, but are there any signs that you think signal a down season, the first year of a decline or the continuation thereof for a given player?

Some names to consider:

-Tobias Harris:  The former max contract player was brought in to add some shooting next to Cade.  He is shooting 26 percent from 3 on 4.2 attempts a night.  

-James Harden:  The playmaking is still elite and the Clippers have been surprisingly able to stay afloat as a result of that and Stromin Norm's emergance but the shooting is Westbrook-esque.  36 field goal percentage and 31 percent from 3 on 8 per game.  It is not pretty and it adds this early 00s feel to the Clippers overall approach to the game.

-Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:  Another struggling veteran, KCP has been horrendous for the Magic to start.  Shooting 21.6 percent from 3 and avergaging 6.9/2.5/1.9 through Orlando's first 11 games, it makes the Nuggets look smart for not re-signing him given how much better Christian Braun has been for Denver.  

-Jalen Green:  Less of a struggle and more of the usual from everyone's favorite NFT dunk contestant, Jalen has been his usual inconsistent self to start after signing a 2+1 with the Rockets.

-Tyrese Haliburton:  He's played better of late but whether one wants to attribute his early issues to a back injury or not, it has hampered the Pacers opening to the season in a weak East.

What are some other names you think should be up for consideration?  Do you disagree with any of the names noted for consideration?",2024-11-12 20:42:42

Besides ""no one can stay healthy"", and ""a shitty coach"", the Pelicans' hole at center was the story line of the off-season. 

Missi has been far better than expectations.  The biggest surprise to me is how he doesn't seem to make the common rookie mistakes. 1 foul and no turnovers for a rookie center putting up 17/11 is a real shocker to me.  He's averaging barely 3 fouls per 48.   He never bites on those up fakes ",2024-11-12 03:38:22

For those that weren’t aware Embiid wasn’t able to play the first few game due to sixers and Embiid not thinking he was ready. Then the Marcus Haynes incident happened so he was suspended three games.

With him not being on the injury report at all, seems very good chance we get to see him play tomorrow in the first day of the nba cup!

Normal Powell - After being one of the best bench scorers for years has started and been absolutely incredible. 

Fred Van Vleet - Having a bad year so far but was very good last year when leading a very young Rockets team.

They're 5th in the West and have a top 10 net rating in the league, with a top 5 defense.

All three of Green/Smith/Brooks are shooting under 40% from the field so far, yet the Rockets still have an offense that ranks 15th in the association. Sengun had an up and down beginning of the year but been fantastic the last several games and taken a real leap on defense, and VanVleet even though he's not shot well from 3, has continued to be a solid table setter and is making his midrange jumper. He and Sengun have a great PnR partnership that the association has yet to solve.

Tari Eason has been fantastic, and now is making a name of himself in the league. Amen Thompson is awesome, he's really coming along offensively. Aaron Holiday is a luxury as a 3rd PG. Steven Adams getting back in gear, he's been decent in the games he's been active and will get better from here.

Rockets are flying under the radar right now and a look at their schedule, something like a 12-6 start or something is very doable for them. Maybe it'll take that for the league to take notice. But in the meantime they are plugging along and doing so without coming close to playing their best basketball honestly. What do you all think about Houston right now?",2024-11-12 22:04:55

nba,1gps2n4,Jokic's Dominance,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gps2n4/jokics_dominance/,38,"I'm going to jump on the glaze train for Jokic's absurd dominance over the NBA for the last half decade. While, I personally still have Jokic in the 15-20 range in my all-time rankings, some of the advanced metrics indicate he's on a fast track towards the top 10, and potentially the top 5 (if he's able to win multiple championships).

I looked at the yearly leaders in the following advanced metrics to see how Jokic stacks up (not including this season, yet) with the all-time greats (Win Shares & PER go back to the 1952 season, but VORP and BPM only to 1974): 

* Win Shares - demonstrates a player's contribution to winning and availability
* PER - efficiency and statistical dominance
* BPM - the player's effect when they're on vs off the court
* VORP - how much better the player is vs. a normal NBA starter

**Win Shares Leaders**

* 9 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* 9 - Michael Jordan
* 8 - Wilt Chamberlain
* 5 - Neil Johnston
* 5 - LeBron James
* 4 - James Harden
* 4 - Nikola Jokic

**PER Leaders**

* 9 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* 7 - Wilt Chamberlain
* 7 - Michael Jordan
* 6 - LeBron James
* 5 - Shaquille O'Neal
* 4 - Bob Pettit
* 4 - Nikola Jokic

**BPM Leaders**

* 9 - Michael Jordan
* 7 - LeBron James
* 6 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* 4 - Larry Bird
* 4 - Shaquille O'Neal
* 4 - Nikola Jokic

**VORP Leaders**

* 9 - LeBron James
* 9 - Michael Jordan
* 7 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* 4 - Larry Bird
* 4 - Nikola Jokic

  
Additionally, I looked at how many seasons did a player lead the league in all 4 of these advanced metrics (which hurt Wilt, Bob Pettit as BPM & VORP aren't available until 1974):

* 7 - Michael Jordan
* 5 - LeBron James
* 4 - Nikola Jokic (as of post, is doing so in the 2024-25 season which would be his 5th time)
* 3 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

  
**Takeaways:**

1. From these advanced metrics, it is very apparent that MJ, LeBron, and KAJ are the top three players of all-time as all of them ranked in, at worst, the top 4 of any of these advanced metrics
2. Jokic's advanced metrics case, not the end-all-be-all of basketball ranking, is showing he should be considered a top 5 player of all time almost already.",2024-11-12 18:46:03

This result had never happened before in NBA history.

Scorigami isn't as interesting in basketball as it is in American football, but it is still pretty cool. One thing that the creator of this (beautiful) website (https://www.scorigaminba.com/) could do to make more scorigamis occur would be to differentiate between home and away teams (for example, a 120-115 counting as a different result as a 115-120).

But statistically speaking, if I'm the Hawks, and let's say I'm up 100-92 on the Celtics with 1 minute left, why on earth would I not start fouling after every 5 seconds? 

That would mean 12 foulw and 24 free throws for the rest of the game. The Celtics would need to foul too as the Hawks could just run out the clock. 

So let's say 24 free throws each for the last minute but you hold an 8 point lead. 

Mathematically, even if you're a slightly higher percentage free throw teaming, let's even to 10% as a team better, that would lead to coming out 2.4 points up after 24 FT's. Even if there were bad luck or some extra misses you still have so much insane wiggle room when it's just a free throw competition between 2 pro teams. 

Don't get me wrong, this would be utterly unwatchable, but why isn't this strategy used? 

You could use bench players to rack up the fouls, would deny all 3 pointers, and would give yourself an insanely high percent chance to win. 

I'm definitely missing something, but what? ",2024-11-12 20:56:33

Back in 2021-2022. Jokic is only being compared to the likes of Moses Malone and David Robinson.

But winning 3 MVPs and 1 FMVP made him like a consensus Top 6 all time center. 

Since everyone is agreering right now that Jokic is a better player than Moses and David.

He is at Top 6 now.

If he will breakthrough Top 5. Who will he kick out?

Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, or Russell?

Those are usual names in Top 10-12 All time Players. 

Do you think he will kick out any of the 5?

I think Kareem is still a better player than him.

But what about Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, or Russell?

Do you think Jokic is better than any of those 4 as a basketball player?

There's a class of them in the league. From observations, they are high first round draft picks with tantalizing physical traits and skills but are moody and have issues playing hard throughout the season. These are the players that teams always give leniency too. Players that negatively affect winning.

D'Angelo Russell, Wiggins before GS, KAT, Brandon Ingram, Zion (probably), Jordan Poole, Herro, Lavine. ",2024-11-12 21:21:41

I have been supporting the Utah Jazz for some years now. Similar values is really important to me which is why I want to get some clarification on things as I live outside of the vibe of these American cities and the basketball teams/organisation values. 

Soooo. When it comes to tanking, I don’t know if that’s like an American thing. But in Australia it’s very looked down on to be tanking in sport. My values are also very much that I’m not a fan of tanking at all.

I want to support a team that values each season and gives their heart and soul each season. I don’t want to support a team that only values success as championships and trophies. I don’t care for a championship if my team tanked some years in the lead up to get draft picks. Can anyone in the Jazz camp, Salt Lake City or just any American give me some clarity on what all this tanking stuff is? How many Jazz fans want the team to tank this season and ‘Capture the Flagg’? Does the Utah Jazz hierarchy want to tank? I don’t think the players and coaches want to for obvious reasons. Which NBA teams and cities/communities are more in line with my beliefs? I have zero tolerance for tanking 

Thanks",2024-11-12 11:04:14

Or am I off base and if LeBron and the Cavs weren’t  standing in their way would they have been exposed by another team anyways?

The Cavs beat the Bulls to make the ECF that year. If the Bulls won instead, would they have also humiliated the Hawks?

Then there are guys like Ty Lawson who relied heavily on speed and inside scoring while cruising by (at the time) with a below average jumper.

nba,1go73ee,How much do you think Trey Murphy's impending return will help the New Orleans Pelicans while Zion is out?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1go73ee/how_much_do_you_think_trey_murphys_impending/,10,"We all saw the news yesterday. Zion, Out. Murphy, In. Murphy set to return tomorrow and play his first game of the season for the Pels after suffering a hamstring strain in training camp, against the Nets.

Zion suffered a right hamstring strain of his own. Same leg as the playoffs and he has suffered right hamstring strains pretty consistently over the years. Considered week to week.

I think Murphy is a starter in this league and a fantastic role player, a true two way guy, who also has a little bit of creation game in him nowadays too, but of course you can't expect the world from him right away. But his mere presence and defensive acumen and versatility I think will make a massive difference for the Pels as he gets his rhythm back, in these next few weeks without five of their top players. 

I think Murphy+Ingram with their current role player crop is maybe enough to scrap a few wins, like tomorrow against the Nets, before hopefully Hawkins and McCollum return in the week after this upcoming one. They'll have to do it on the defensive end, but Murphy is obviously someone who can aid with that, and he can shoot. CJ was expected to be re-evaluated after two weeks and we're approaching that date. Hawkins a few days ago reported to be out 1-2 weeks with a back strain.

What do you all think? How much do you think TM3's return helps the Pels in these next several games?",2024-11-10 18:21:55

nba,1gnjuzo,[NBA University] Who leads the NBA in paint FG%? A rim running center? A freak athlete ball handler? Nope… 6’1 TJ McConnell! Shooting 77.3% on 5.5 paint FGA per game this season. 19/24 at the rim and 15/20 from paint non-rim. One of the most unique hoopers in the Association.,346,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnjuzo/nba_university_who_leads_the_nba_in_paint_fg_a/,43,"The fact that TJ can do this given his limited athleticism, limited size with short wingspan, at his age, and the fact that everyone knows he's going to go to the same spot feels crazy that he can be this efficient. 

I love stats like these that are so unlikely or lobsided compared to what one would normally expect.  Can anyone else think of any wild unexpected or odd individual NBA statistics that rival this?",2024-11-09 21:01:24

nba,1gnnfgc,ESPN broadcast and media product have been disappointing across the board,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnnfgc/espn_broadcast_and_media_product_have_been/,55,"ESPN media quality has deteriorated across the board. I know people like Stephen A. or Perkins aren't popular on this sub but it goes beyond those TV talking heads. Their game broadcasts used to be and was their saving grace. But now it feels flat and doesn't give national TV vibe at all. Now I wish we still had Mark Jackson and JVG - despite their irrelevant jokes and rants.  

And their analysts have become 100% ESPNified. Bob Myers looks so out of place on the analyst desk as they 'analyze' the game for 30 seconds during halftime. Nobody has time to talk about what is happening on the court. Its all big picture hot takes or game highlights. 


Now might be a good time to talk about this because Windhorst recently talked about how NBA media is suffering this season. Pretty ironic because the producers and executives at ESPN are partially responsible.


>NBA media right now, we’re not in a great place. Because I think we’re devaluing things … that help build the league up. Like one of the things [is] storytelling. Everything is too short right now. People are too focused on tweets, too focused on guys getting crossed-over, guys getting dunked on, guys getting embarrassed, social media posts. Not as much on storytelling, learning about players and learning their backgrounds, what I call chronicling the season.

So what is the point of doing reactionary takes and negative commentary if that is not working anymore? I might be asking for a lot but they could start treating NBA as a sport.",2024-11-09 23:49:51

Just a fun prediction thread. Zach Edey and Donovan Clingan are both Old School Giant Centers in the Modern Nba Game. As Rookies,   
they might bring back the Traditional Big Man Game.

How good are they though?

Do you think they are just another Jahil Okafors in the making?

Or they can at least be like Zubac? Or they can even be better than Zubac?

Are they starting center level? Or just a Reliever Center kind of Nba Bigs?

They are taller and Bigger than Zubac. But can they be as skilled?

What do you think?",2024-11-11 08:01:27

nba,1gnt7jw,Common Sense: why we shouldn’t rank peak play based on accolades,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnt7jw/common_sense_why_we_shouldnt_rank_peak_play_based/,33,"One problem with objective systems like this that people come up with is that they get the weights wrong - who’s to say all your major awards are equally valuable? Who’s to say all the things that should be awarded for ARE awarded for? For example, there’s no OPOY but there is a DPOY. If there was an OPOY absolutely zero about the players or on court impacts would change, but your rankings would. This is bad.

Another is that they miss everything EXCEPT these awards. Think of Rudy Gobert vs a guy who finished 2nd in DPOY and 2nd in MVP but gets neither award.

A third is that these awards are not independent - for example, having teammates good enough to make the finals is what allows you to be able to win the Finals MVP. If you don’t make the finals, you can’t win the Finals MVP.

Which leads me to the biggest issue… your valuation of players is not independent of their teammates. No evaluation can be perfect, including mine, but consider the following scenario:

(1) 2021-2024 Jokic plays as he has on the Nuggets. So he gets the awards he has.

(2) Jokic was drafted in the same year and has developed exactly the same skillset, but plays on the Celtics instead. His teammates are much better so he’s won many championships and Finals MVPs.

The two Jokic’s are exactly the same player and should be evaluated as such, but they wouldn’t have the same accolades and would place differently on your list. This shouldn’t be the case if we’re ranking peak performance: two players who are exactly the same should have the exact same ranking regardless of surrounding environment.

You are doing an abbreviated career accolades rank over a period of peak years. That’s different from a ranking of how good players were at their best.",2024-11-10 05:05:53

nba,1gnjovp,Anthony Edwards Jump Shooting Leap,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnjovp/anthony_edwards_jump_shooting_leap/,46,"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that Ant's shooting this season is just small sample size theater. I agree that the sample size is not large enough to make conclusions, and I think he is specifically on a 3P heater right now. BUT we are starting to accumulate a decent jump shooting sample size that might be indicative of a leap if we stretch our timeline a bit.


If we go back and take into account Ant's jump shooting (catch and shoot+pull up) through the playoffs and Olympics (including exhibition games) along with his regular season start this year, we start to get a larger sample that might point to a trend.


Caveats:

- I was unable to find stats for his 2PT jump shots in the Olympics. If someone can find that, I will adjust the numbers. The numbers at the end will might be slightly lower once a few more 2PT shots are included. 

- The Olympic 3PT line is shorter, but I don't have the shot data to determine which shots would and would not have been 3s in the NBA. I'm counting all of them as 3s bc I have a narrative to push.

- Ant also did not take a 3 in one game in the olympics so I'm only counting 9 games.


2024 PLAYOFFS JUMP SHOTS (16 games):

2PT: 42/87

3PT: 45/114

219 points on 201 jump shots 


OLYMPICS (9 games):

3PT: 17/41

51 points on 41 jump shots


2024 REGULAR SEASON (9 games):

2PT: 12/29

3PT: 50/104

174 points on 133 jump shots


TOTALS

34 GAMES

444 points on 375 jump shots


So we have a sample size of almost 400 shots spanning 34 games across 7 months where Anthony Edwards has shot...


**1.18 PTS PER JUMP SHOT**


For normies, this would equal 118 points per 100 possessions or a 118 OFFRTG. That would be the 4th best offense in the league last year....

For comparison:

Steph Curry had a 1.14 points per jump shot last regular season

Kevin Durant had a 1.09 points per jump shot last regular season

SGA had a 1.04  points per jump shot last regular season


At 23 years old, Ant is already one of the best rim pressuring guards in the league due to his elite athleticism and first step. So if he also becomes a knock down shooter, I believe he will enter that territory where he is simply unguardable. If you guard the rim, he's pulling up at a good clip. If you guard the shot, he'll blow by you. If you double... well he's still figuring that out.

If this trend ends up being true, a slight playmaking leap within the next few years would pave the path for a truly dominant player to emerge.

Obviously, this is best case scenario and hopeful wishes from a Wolves fan, but let me know what yall think. ",2024-11-09 20:53:26

nba,1gnk439,"The Warriors are 7-2, but have to figure out their starting lineup.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnk439/the_warriors_are_72_but_have_to_figure_out_their/,10,"And last night against the Cavs, some issues were highlighted and magnified we have seen in other games but not exposed to the degree we saw tonight. 

Kuminga was moved to the bench and he has thrived as 6th man off the bench. The Warriors aren't gonna play Draymond at the 5 full time in the regular season. Their defense has been as good as it has in part because they've been able to run TJD/SlowMo/Looney effectively at the 5 and you can run aggressive defensive schemes with those three at the 5 and allow Dray to be more aggressive himself defensively as a result, rather than hold the back line.

Last night was a step backward, but the offense was the cause of that, less so the defense. It's difficult to be able to stop a team with the firepower of the Cavs when you can't score, when you turn the ball over, and allow them to get out in transition and you're not able to set your defense. And it raises some questions about the starting 5 for the Warriors. While you like the idea of being able to start games setting a defensive tone, GPII/Dray/TJD are three guys that you don't really have to guard on the perimeter. Dray made a few 3's last night but the Cavs didn't guard him. He isn't finishing well on his rim attacks. 

GPII will look to take advantage of space that teams give him from the outside and cut to the rim and find his way to easy baskets, but overall those three don't provide scoring offensively. Wiggins injured his back and hasn't been close to the same offensively since his return. 

The floor balance isn't there, there's not enough shooting, not enough playmaking or creation with this unit. When the Warriors start struggling offensively we see Steph and Dray begin to get lax and turn the ball over. The lead ballooned in the second quarter last night because those two were throwing outlet passes trying to avoid having to play in the halfcourt with the Cavs defense. The Clippers also forced a lot of turnovers out of the Warriors. Teams with length, physicality, switchability are going to be able to cause this Warriors team problems on that end. The Celtics did as well throughout much of that game.

You understand why Kuminga is coming off the bench in the role he's in currently---SSS but didn't shoot the 3 well as a starter, didn't shoot it well in preseason, but the last two games has been solid. The Warriors want him to access some ancillary/off-ball skills that they feel he hasn't quite been able to grow into at a level where starting him makes sense for him or the team. But they're going to have to at least replace GPII in the starting lineup if they want to have a functional offense. Thoughts?",2024-11-09 21:13:03

Players who traditionally may have been shooting guards due to height like Cunningham, SGA, Luka are all point guards. Basically if you are elite with the ball and aren’t a forward you will be a point guard.

 this is not entirely the case but this is the trend and it is turning the shooting guard into a role players position into one or two categories. 1) a high volume scorer but cannot be a 1 option on a good team  (Poole, Green, Thomas) 2) a lockdown defender that compliments the star guard (Caruso, White, Daniels).

I don't think anyone can deny that his increase in production also comes as a result of playing next to Nikola Jokic.

Several ex Nuggets including Jerami Grant, Bruce Brown and KCP got big contracts from other teams and didn't end up playing up to their contract because they cannot replicate Jokic's playmaking on their system.

Will teams offer Christian Braun big money or is there enough sample size now to think it's likely because of playing next to Jokic?",2024-11-09 07:30:56

nba,1gmkhle,Bradley Beal is playing the best defense of his life,592,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gmkhle/bradley_beal_is_playing_the_best_defense_of_his/,95,"Have you ever thought about how rechargeable batteries work?

Like most people, I assume, I never gave them much thought. You plug one into an outlet, and portable electricity just sort of piles up inside, like filling up a champagne flute with Miller High Life, right?

That, of course, isn’t quite accurate. As you use a battery, electrons flow from the negative end to the positive end. When equilibrium is established, flow ceases, and the battery dies. To charge the battery, you have to put in energy to reverse the flow and force electrons back to the negative side.

Apologies to any engineers out there for the gross oversimplification, but I was thinking about the flow of electrons from one end to the other when considering Bradley Beal’s career arc. Few players have had as many ups (relatively) and downs (absolutely) as Beal. He’s had multiple seasons with a [Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/203078)in the bottom decile!

Of course, in each of those years, Beal was an elite offensive player, generally making up for his porous defense. However, since his trade to Phoenix last season, Beal has understood his assignment better than most. By almost any measure, he’s playing at or near career-best defensive levels, forcing electrons from one side of his battery to the other.

To wit, here is a chart I made with his D-EPM percentiles by year: \[[chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Most players don’t have the peaks and valleys we see above, and it’s even rarer to see someone reach new heights in their 13th season. To further my case, here is his Defensive DARKO chart, another all-in-one defensive metric: \[[chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

You and I don’t need to know exactly what goes into those models to understand what they’re saying: the defensive battery is fully recharged!

If you’re not into alphabet soups, Beal’s newfound defensive prowess is borne out in more easily digestible ways, too. Beal is averaging the most steals and blocks of his career so far (which, naturally, means he sports [the highest Defensive Box Plus/Minus](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bealbr01.html) of his life by a mile). Phoenix lineups with Beal [only give up 111.3 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/231/lineups#tab-four_factors), a well above-average mark.

NBA players do not usually see a massive defensive upswing in their 30s; defense is a younger man’s game, reliant upon quick-twitch athleticism and endurance. But Beal’s defense is far from a numbers-driven narrative. Coach Mike Budenholzer has deployed him as the starters’ point-of-attack pitbull. [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203078/head-to-head) says his primary defensive matchups have included Tyrese Maxey, Anfernee Simons, and LeBron James (perhaps somewhat of James’ choosing, but they haven’t been eaten up in those minutes!), and BBall-Index says that Beal has had the toughest defensive assignments of any Suns starter by a mile.

Now, he’s hardly perfect. I’m not trying to pull an [Anna Sorokin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sorokin) here; Beal won’t be making anybody’s All-Defensive teams. As a small-ish guard, he can only do so much against bigger players. He occasionally gets caught going under screens when he should go over, and bizarrely, at least twice, I’ve seen him tying his shoe in the middle of the defensive action: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

But shoelace issues aside, the effort level is consistently there. He’s putting in the energy to reverse the flow. How often have we seen a player go from max-contract, first-option status to grit-and-grinder almost overnight? How many undersized former 30-point scorers add the ability late in their career to destroy a 3-on-1 fastbreak like a miniature Draymond Green? \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Although he’s been around seemingly forever, Beal is just 31 years old, and he still has excellent lateral agility and a 6’7” wingspan. He has some good (though not great) physical tools, and as the charts above show, he’s unleashed them in a way we haven’t seen in years. He’s playing hard, like when he fights through two screens to contest a Tyrese Maxey triple here: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Or here, where he effortlessly flits past two more screens again and harasses Tyler Herro into a slip: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

I hear you harrumphing. Rock-solid screen navigation, but not precisely highlight-worthy, right? That’s sort of the point. This is what Beal looks like all the time: *workmanlike*. You can go pretty far with a coherent defensive scheme and effort in the NBA.

“I’m very excited about taking on the task of guarding guys,” [Beal said a few days ago.](https://arizonasports.com/story/3563061/suns-defense-bradley-beal-improve/) “I just think that’s another level I can tap into.”

And that’s a level that the entire Suns *team* has tapped into. It’s true that Phoenix has faced a slate of opposing offenses more crippled than me after my forthcoming meniscus repair — two games against the Clippers without Kawhi plus a match against an Embiid-less 76ers team — but they’ve maintained a level of focus and intensity we haven’t seen from the Durant-era Suns in the past.

The Suns switch less than they used to, and Budenholzer has challenged his players to get over screens and stay attached to the ballhandler’s hip. Coach Bud’s teams are almost always elite defensively, and he has a strict ethos passed down from his days on Spurs coach Gregg Popovich’s staff: [never, ever foul](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/which-new-nba-head-coach-is-best).

For a guy oft-criticized in the past for being too rigid, Budenholzer has changed his defensive philosophy in important ways (besides the no-fouls mandate). For example, his old Bucks teams used to allow opposing teams to shoot as many threes as they wanted, as long as those shots came from suboptimal shooters. Teams have gotten so good at shooting over the last few seasons, however, that this strategy is no longer tenable. His final Milwaukee season [saw the Bucks rank fourth in three-point attempt rate](https://thef5.substack.com/p/pushing-buttons) allowed after being bottom-five in the previous four seasons. So far, the Suns have[ been top-10 in disallowing threes](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/24/team#tab-shooting_defense_frequency) (including third in preventing corner threes) and 11th in opposing free-throw rate (a number I expect to improve over time with fewer games against the freebie-tastic Lakers).

The Suns rarely force turnovers (another Bud trademark), preferring to stay disciplined in their approach, but they clean the defensive glass at an elite mark. Add it all up, and you have a defensive identity that is both clear and (so far, at least) effective.

It’s tempting to say Phoenix’s defense is more than the sum of its parts, but that’s doing the parts a discourtesy. Jusuf Nurkic is an excellent drop defender with surprisingly quick hands, even if he can struggle with more mobile matchups (see his benching against AD). He doesn’t get nearly the love he deserves for his long-time defensive prowess.

Royce O’Neale is the consummate 3-and-D professional (and a vastly underrated playmaker, but I digress) who has been a change-of-pace small-ball five throughout the season. Rookie Ryan Dunn is already the best defender on the team, a grizzly bear mirroring footsteps like a particularly toothy shadow. He’s the situational break-glass player for when the Suns need some bigger perimeter help. Devin Booker has been his customary solid self, and Kevin Durant has been more than solid. Grayson Allen, Mason Plumlee, and Tyus Jones are not gifted individual defenders, but they know the gameplan, and they execute.

When it all comes together, Phoenix can string together some gorgeous sequences: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

It’s a long season. A lot can go wrong for both the injury-prone Beal (already nursing an elbow injury) and his squad. The Suns are a rickety bunch at the best of times, and we don’t know how they will hold up when they go against more dangerous offenses.

But it’s hard to point to what the Suns should be doing better, given their competition so far, and it starts with their third-wheel star embracing his new role as a high-energy stopper. Beal’s battery is full, and if it can keep a charge through the playoffs, Phoenix’s 7-1 start will prove no fluke.",2024-11-08 15:00:08

This is not a hot take but I just like basketball. So sue me.

He leads the league in touches per game despite not bringing the ball up as much as SGA or Trae or Luka. 

He also generates the most offense while ALSO being the most efficient with it. 

When you do points created from assists + points + free throws from pass , he leads the league. Trae and Luka are Second and third. Trae being a top three offense while an injured as hell hawks squad underperforms is a tale as old as time.

Sorry quick pause for Trae Young propaganda, he is the opposite of Jokic but he is incredible and has a game that kids should try and copy. It's all footwork, pacing and putting people in the right spots. He is the second coming of Nate Archibald and I don't know if he can be the best player in a championship team but he is really fucking good at basketball and the hate is too much.

Back to Jokic.

He does all that while having an around 67% ts. Hope he has a roster that lets him compete in the next two or so years. He seems like the kind of player that should have two rings and retire as the next center in the inner circle of centers, we should be having the Jokic or Moses Malone conversation any day now.",2024-11-10 22:17:58

nba,1gn26b6,The Bucks defense without Andre Jackson Jr. is laughable. He needs to play more minutes.,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gn26b6/the_bucks_defense_without_andre_jackson_jr_is/,19,"The Bucks lost tonight by 22 points. The game was essentially non-competitive by the midway point of the second quarter and became laughable by the 4th. The defense was embarrassing for the Milwaukee Bucks, just so slow on rotation, zero contain on the perimeter whatsoever, Brook really struggled dealing with KAT and to the Knicks credit, they forced Brook to remain on a swivel out there, made his life difficult defensively, and KAT utilized his quickness and shooting talent to make Brook's life hell.

But there was one player who did have a good defensive night tonight. That was Andre Jackson Jr. But he only played 13 minutes. Obviously, we know the questions marks surround his jumper, but this team truly needs a chaos guy and they need athleticism. They lack athleticism on the perimeter. I called AJ Green a weak defender and some of you pushed back, but the truth is when you force him to navigate traffic and defend multiple actions, he struggles to keep up and lack of agility and other deficiencies come into play. He's not good enough on that end, but the Bucks also need the shooting he provides.

They're just a really slow, kinda labored team, without consistent flow offensively and honestly just without defensive talent. Giannis can get the job done individually obviously at this stage but his team defense has not been great this season. Giannis hasn't been a great option at C defensively the last few seasons, but the Bucks don't have much else at that spot behind Brook, they have crumbled this year in net rating when he's on the bench. Portis has been extremely poor this season overall and that is a major problem for the Bucks going forward, he's been one of the worst net rating players in the entire association and doesn't offer a lot on defense.

Andre Jackson has to play. He does enough with his connective passing, being just an energy guy on offense, runs the floor, to provide some value but he can be a better cutter and off ball mover. He needs to be more active to truly tap into that energy guy role on offense. But his defense is really legit, and his athleticism is something this team lacks. They need to play him a lot, and tonight made that clear if it wasn't already. Even when Middleton returns.",2024-11-09 04:34:22

For some reasons, injury prone players like Lamelo, AD, and to a lesser extent even Zion was able to play this season.
(Except for Kawhi and Joel cause for some various different reasons, they play very few games)

But focusing on Lamelo,

He is playing extremely well now. 

Averaging like 28 and 6 so far. 

He is outperforming former all nba Point Guards Steph, Hali, Brunson, and Harden right now.

Luka and SGA are obviously Top 2 points guards still.

But top 3 is up for grabs. 

Dame, Trae, Maxey, Ja, etc are also playing well.

But Do you think Lamelo (if healthy) is a Top 5 PG level in the league?

PS:

The Point Guard Talent in the nba is insane.

nba,1gn1xka,Who is the Best SG right now? ,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gn1xka/who_is_the_best_sg_right_now/,78,"It is a 3 Way debate  from last season up to now.

Booker VS Mitchell VS Ant

Ant is like 4-5 years younger. And already in the convo with Booker/Mitchell. Top SGs in their primes. (27-28, yrs olds). Amazingly, he also averaged more points so far. With 28 ppg.

However, Mitchell is leading the Cavs to a Top seed. And he still having great stats with 24 pts a game.

Booker is playing with other volume pure scorers like KD and Beal. But still, managed to average the same amount of points as Mitchell.

Based on the level of play and eye test you saw from the 3 from last season's regular season to last season's playoffs. Up to this season. 

Who do you think is the best SG among the 3?

Did Ant already surpassed Booker/Mitchell despite being significantly younger?

Or the best sg is still between Booker and Mitchell?

Who is the best?

The Spider, The Book, or the Ant?",2024-11-09 04:20:37

He had 2 free throws vs the Nets, but even that came from a loose ball foul and not a 2 point shot attempt.   
  
What's more impressive is that this trend started from the preseason; he also did not shoot a single 2 pointer in 4 games, but his shooting percentage is a lot worse (4/15, 26.7%).

CB in particular is doing great. What a monstrous leap in development, going from about 7 PPG to about 15 PPG, while playing tough defense. Waston's  coming along. He led the Nuggets in blocks last season despite limited minutes and he continues to swat shots this season.

Julian Strawther is also another promising pick.

I had doubts about the Westbrook acquisition but after starting 2 games with Jokic, it seems like Russ has developed chemistry with the team to be more productive and less damaging than in the first few games.

The Saric acquisition was terrible though.

Also not re-signing KCP turned out to be the right move for obvious reasons.",2024-11-09 22:00:47

nba,1gnsat3,Kawhi trade value.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnsat3/kawhi_trade_value/,81,"After a rather funny comment by a fellow redditer, I was wondering what you guys think Kawhi's worth on the trade market assuming the Clippers are willing to move on + some other team is willing to pursue him.

Stuff to keep in mind:
- he's 33 years old.
- he's making 49 mill this year (7th in the entire league)
- has two more years left on his contract.
- has missed 196 regular season games over the past 6 seasons (approx. 40%)

Clippers don't have their pick next season so tanking is not an option for them one would presume, so they would want to get impactful pieces in return.

Only teams I see going for Kawhi realistically speaking are the warriors, Mavs, wolves and nuggets.

Trade 1:
Warriors get: Kawhi
Clippers get: Wiggins, Looney, Kuminga, Gary Payton II and 2027 first.

Trade 2:
Mavs get: Kawhi and Batum
Clippers get: Klay, P.J, Gafford, Kleber and the 2025 first.

Trade 3:
Wolves acquiring Kawhi seems impossible due to 2nd apron shenanigans if I'm not mistaken unless it was a three team deal? And I ain't stepping into those murky waters

Trade 4:
Nuggets get: Kawhi and Batum
Clippers get: MPJ, Nnaji, Saric and two first round picks 

I am by no means a trade expert, but I found this subject intriguing and thought I'd get y'all opinion on it.
Feel free to suggest other trades you may find appropriate.
Remember people this is a hypothetical situation, not saying clippers trading Kawhi or teams are actively pursuing him.",2024-11-10 04:12:09

nba,1gnfddv,Never watched NBA. What team should I start to watch?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1gnfddv/never_watched_nba_what_team_should_i_start_to/,79,"Hi guys, 
I'm a 29 year old guy from Romania, and as all of you might know this already, NBA is not the king of sports in Europe, yet it had an increase in popularity in the last couple of years.

I have never watched NBA and I would like to start watching it, but honestly I have no idea with which team I should start, or more specifically which team to have as a favorite pick.

Here in Romania I have noticed that Chicago Bulls are the most searched for ( and I could see myself to start watching them because of their bull logo since the Moldavia region in Romania has a bull on their flag :)))  ), but I am more interested in finding out about an "" underdog"" team because I always like to see an underdog rise through the ranks.


Do you guys have any underdog in mind from NBA?
Or any recommendation ? 

Thank you in advance! 


**EDIT** : I would like to thank everyone again for their recommendations,insights and information. I've watched yesterday the final from the end of the season 2023/2024 between Celtics and Mavericks and I got hooked.
Most of the answers were pointing out to Spurs and OKC, so I also watched the game between Rockets and Thunder from 8th of November and I was hooked again :D 

So thank you to everyone again for their answers, I'll definatelly check as many teams as I can and I'll decide next season on a favorite team, but so far, the game itself seems interesting so I think I have a new favorite sport to watch :D ",2024-11-09 17:37:44
