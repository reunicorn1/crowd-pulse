Ever looked at your grocery bill and wondered if tomatoes somehow became a luxury item overnight? Or felt like your energy bills were part of some cosmic joke? üòÖ

I just put together an article diving into this ‚Äúdouble squeeze‚Äù we‚Äôre all feeling‚Äîhow inflation and climate-driven costs are ganging up to make basic living feel like a premium package.

I think we can all agree that life can be incredibly unfair. One person is sitting comfortably, enjoying their favorite meal, while someone else on the other side of the world is witnessing their family being torn to shreds‚Äîhow horrific. Somewhere else, a person has to walk miles just to fetch water infested with bacteria, while another person only needs to extend their arm for the bottle of clean water that‚Äôs on their table.

There are countless societal problems in the world‚Äîhunger, water scarcity, climate change, education inequality, homelessness, and more. While many people don‚Äôt have the financial means to make a difference, they might have the right words, strategies, or ideas to create change.

I‚Äôm building a social crowdfunding platform where users can discuss these issues, raise awareness, and propose actionable solutions. The platform promotes collaboration by allowing users to outline solutions in multiple phases. It fosters a community for sharing ideas, engaging in meaningful discussions, and working together to tackle real-world challenges. Leaders can also create and lead projects that the community can follow and support.

The beta will be private and launches on November 30. I‚Äôm looking for people interested in joining this journey, providing feedback, and helping shape the platform. If you‚Äôre Interested in participating or would like to get to know more about me or the project, you can message me on reddit or add me on discord to have a chat (itsomidkhber).

Thank you for reading, and I will appreciate your input!

My life was full of promise. I had a job, dreams for the future, and a close-knit group of friends and family. But all of that was taken away from me when the conflict erupted.

The place I once called home is now just a memory. My family and I were forced to flee, and now we‚Äôre living in a small tent in Rafah City. There are 27 of us crammed into this tiny space, including 13 children and a newborn. Every day, we struggle to find food, warmth, and safety. Loved ones.

The dreams I had for the future now feel like distant memories, overshadowed by the daily fight for survival. My friends, my community, so many have been scattered, displaced, or worse. The laughter and joy that once filled my life have been replaced by fear and uncertainty.

The hardest part is the loss of the intangible things‚Äîthe memories of better times, the bonds with friends and neighbors, and the sense of security that came from knowing we had a home. These things can never be replaced.

Life in Gaza is not just a struggle for survival‚Äîit‚Äôs a constant reminder of what we‚Äôve lost. I wanted to shed light on the harsh reality we face every day. It‚Äôs a life filled with pain, but also with a small, flickering hope that one day, things might change.",2024-10-26 09:01:13

In that time I have helped more than 7,000 professionals earn their accreditation by passing the LEED Green Associate exam, LEED AP BD+C, and WELL AP exam.  
  
I have trained at universities, training centers, municipalities, and companies to help their employees prepare for the LEED and WELL certification exams using my simplified study material.

- - - - - - - - - - - -

The below are the most frequently asked questions I‚Äôve been asked and how you can pass in 2 weeks:

**#1 How to register for the LEED exam and WELL AP exam?**  
*The LEED GA and AP exam registration are the same.*  
Step 1, create a [USGBC](http://usgbc.org) account  
Step 2, purchase the official LEED exam you are targeting (cost of the exam below).  
Step 3, use the code USGBC gives you after purchase (valid for 1 year) and head to [Prometric](https://prometric.com/gbci) to schedule a time and day using the code. (You can schedule the exam from home or at a test center).

WELL AP exam registration is the same but should create an account and purchase the exam on [IWBI](https://www.wellcertified.com/) not USGBC.

- - - - - - - - - - - -

**#2 How much does the LEED exam cost? WELL AP exam cost?**

* LEED Green Associate costs $250 (veterans for free, USGBC member companies get a discount and students take the exam for $100).

* LEED AP costs $350 ( veterans free, students $250 and USGBC members get a discount)

* LEED GA+AP combined exam $550 (4 hour exam both credentials in 1 sitting)

* WELL AP costs $299 ( students 125$)

- - - - - - - - - - - -

**#3 Where to find Free LEED study material, free practice exams?**

Complete study materials are not free but you can find free introductory videos, sample exams, free articles that help build a foundation.  


* Youtube videos:

   * [Archiroots](https://www.youtube.com/@leedgreenassociate) (my simplified trainings)

   * [Karim Elnabawy Balbaa](https://www.youtube.com/@karimelnabawy) ( arabic, not simplified, long content)

   * [GBES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fblbsbhnWxY&t=1s&pp=ygUEZ2Jlcw%3D%3D) (long content, sometimes includes outdated material)

   * [Projectific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFAj0EYMmuY&list=PL41wJLAXQMaM-J8dtbZKW_EV-xgNgMQI7) (very long, Ai computer voice)



* Free practice questions:

   * [LEED GA sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-leed-green-associate-practice-exam/)

   * [LEED AP BD+C sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-leed-ap-bdc-practice-exam/)

   * [WELL AP sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-well-ap-practice-exam/)



* Handbook:

   * [LEED GA candidate handbook](https://build.usgbc.org/leed-green-associate-handbook)

   * [LEED AP candidate handbook](https://build.usgbc.org/leed-ap-handbook)

   * [WELL AP handbook](https://a.storyblok.com/f/52232/x/78041f6cd4/well-ap-candidate-handbook-october-2023.pdf)

- - - - - - - - - - - -

**#4 What are the requirements to take the exam?**

* LEED GA: no requirements, only to be above 18 years old.

* LEED AP: a valid non expired LEED GA credential. (Expired? need to take the GA exam again).

* WELL AP exam: no requirements.

No experience, no specific discipline (even professional not in the building industry can take the exam).  
No background or knowledge is required and no you do not need to have worked on a LEED or WELL project to take the exam.

- - - - - - - - - - - -

**#5 How to get free LEED CE hours?**  
  
After you pass the LEED GA exam, you have 2 years to satisfy 15 continuing education hours.  
After you pass the LEED AP exam, you need 30 continuing hours.  
  
Best approach is to do the GA exam, just before it expires become a LEED AP. You will get 2 extra years so you won't do any GA CE hours. You will need to do AP CE hours after that, meaning 4 years to do CE hours since you got a reset when you upgraded to AP.  
  
To satisfy those hours, do not buy LEED CE hours. You can find free hours on [USGBC](https://www.usgbc.org/education-listing), just filter the free videos and select the credential you want videos for.

  
- - - - - - - - - - - -

**#6 What is the difference between LEED GA, LEED AP and WELL AP?**

* LEED Green Associate, basic green building principles, LEED certification overview.

* LEED AP, more technical information about LEED. You need to learn how to calculate a credit, few formulas, more things to memorize. Showcases this professional can streamline and handle the LEED certification process fully whereas a LEED GA would be good to monitor and understand.

* WELL AP, there is no WELL Green Associate only WELL AP. You have to know all WELL certification material.

The LEED certification focus on energy performance, reducing negative impact on the environment, sustainable building practices.(Green building aspects).  
  
Whereas the WELL certification is a complimentary certification, it focuses on the occupant inside the project, how the project and company supports the occupant and employees in the project. Nourishment, food, fitness, air quality, thermal comfort, mind and similar. (Health and well-being of occupants in a project)

**#7 How to prepare and make sure you pass in 2 week:**

1. Take this [**LEED GA simplified training**](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep/), [**LEED AP BD+C simplified training**](http://archiroots.com/what-is-the-leed-ap-certification/) or [**WELL AP simplified training**](https://archiroots.com/well-ap-exam-prep/) watch 30 minutes a day to learn all material in 1 week. You can watch more, maybe even finish it in 1 day. But ideally 30 minutes to make sure you have grasped the material and was not heavy on your long day at work or school. The goal is to understand the concepts not cover content.

1. Exercise on 1 [**practice exam**](https://archiroots.com/leed-courses) a day for 1 week to make sure you learned the material. You might know the content but still answer incorrectly, you have to get used to how tricks come in the exam. Use the elimination strategy, highlight keywords and similar. All tips and tricks are included in the training.

1. During that week of practice exams, it is good to review through flashcards. They are basically study cards that include all the important key terms and definitions to be able to review on the go. [LEED GA Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-flashcards/) / [LEED AP Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/leed-ap-bd-c-flashcards/) / [WELL AP Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/well-ap-flashcards/).

Is 2 weeks enough to prepare? Yes and No! If you purchase a $200 book of 800 pages, it will surely take you around 3 months. But if you follow a [simplified training](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep/) it is quite easy to be ready in weeks and NEVER take the official exam without passing practice exams, even if you have memorized a thick book, EVEN IF YOU HAVE LEED PROJECT EXPERIENCE!

I am still paying off my last psych visit, so don‚Äôt make things worse. Only ever earning minimum wage or slightly more, it‚Äôs been expensive after 6 years building five private and nonprofit brands to attract 1.3% of the global economy to pay for ending world hunger, ending world poverty, planting enough trees to end anthropogenic climate change, and cleaning up the ocean of garbage. Yeah dude, that‚Äôs how obvious the solution is but that‚Äôs how bad things are that humanity hasn‚Äôt figured out how to do it yet. It‚Äôs absurd. It‚Äôs not our fault. It‚Äôs just absurd. My team‚Äôs business model employs multiple financial pipelines accessing even more of the global market to tackle even more environmental problems. Stick around to learn more.¬†
* The situation in Yemen is so delicate with government and media coverage that it is probably safest to just proceed with ONLY these kinds of charities that are still allowed to help out, and low key guerrilla marketing. Therefore, NO NEWS, JUST VOLUNTEER ACTIVIST GUERRILLA MARKETING i.e. take time to DM and comment template or personalized writing without links to people you trust to respect admin‚Äôs rules.

While there are numerous recycling programs in place, I'm skeptical of their effectiveness.

I find the idea of using biodegradable plastics for consumer electronics intriguing, such as PLA and PHA. Currently, I'm wrapping up ""Cradle-to-Cradle"" by Michael Braungart and William McDonough, but I find myself at odds with their cradle-to-cradle concept. Convincing everyone to adopt cradle-to-cradle seems like a monumental task, and realistically, many people simply dispose of their garbage in landfills. I believe that biodegradable plastics, on the other hand, could at least break down in landfills, potentially making a larger impact in the long run.

I'm eager to spark a conversation on this topic. If anyone has recommendations for further reading materials or books, I'd love to hear them.",2024-04-18 23:50:46

I feel like the non-green public opinion identifies too often greens with tree-whisperers whose ideals are driven by some spiritual connection to nature. 
An example: the advantage of organic (bio) on the environment and on health has some scientific roots. Biodynamics is a pseudo-esoteric new age movement rooted in the esoteric beliefs of a racist self-proclaimed prophet.

I feel that often the public identifies the former (solid green principles) and their supporters with the latter (esoteric BS) and the brainwashed who believe in these things. 

Another example: nuclear power (this could cause debate) is statistically safer than most energy sources, more abundant, lower CO2 intensity. Yet the German green movement pushed for decades to close plants. Result: German energy is consistently among the highest CO2-intense in Europe. 

These unscientific in my opinion, undermine the credibility of the whole green movement. Is the time ripe for a *scientific* Green Party?",2024-04-01 11:29:21

I‚Äôve been working on something that‚Äôs really important to me, and I think it could be valuable to you too. It‚Äôs called GreenGauge Analytics. The idea came from my own struggles and desires to make my e-commerce operations more sustainable without just shooting in the dark. I wanted to make decisions based on what consumers really care about when it comes to sustainability, not just what we think they do.

So, I started building a platform to provide actionable insights into consumer sentiment on sustainability and the latest trends that are shaping the e-commerce landscape. But here‚Äôs the thing - it‚Äôs not just about what I believe is needed. This is about creating something that truly serves our community of eco-conscious brands and consumers.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I need your help. Before we go full steam ahead, I want to make sure we‚Äôre on the right track. If you have a moment, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could sign up to stay in the loop and maybe share your thoughts through a short survey. Your feedback would mean the world to me and really help shape this into something that can genuinely support businesses like yours in making a positive impact.

You can sign up [here](https://123carmartin321.wixsite.com/greengaugeanalytics). Thank you so much for your time and for considering being a part of this journey. Let‚Äôs make sustainability at the core of e-commerce together.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

To put it simply (bear with me till the end) our current lithium-ion batteries (typically used in electric cars) have the potential for 254 watt hours per kilogram (254 W‚Ä¢h/kg). So for every kilogram of lithium ion battery, you can get 254 watt hours. This is a good way to express energy. Keep that number in your head. 

Now, the reason airplanes cannot be electric is because without a constant stream of electricity from a power cable (impossible at 30,000 feet), we must rely on batteries to power the aircraft. The best batteries we have are lithium ion. We hope to one day reach the difficult goal of perhaps 300 W‚Ä¢h/kg but it is still pretty far off. 

On the other hand, currently aircraft use kerosene as jet fuel. A mixture with additives to make it burn cleaner and more efficiently, but essentially kerosene with the same energy density. Kerosene, a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù fuel, has the energy potential of 12,000 W‚Ä¢h/kg. The only reason we can fly commercially and internationally is due to this immense energy density found only in fossil fuels, safe enough to use in close proximity to the public, light enough to not weigh down the aircraft. 12,000 vs 254‚Ä¶ It is why so much of our infrastructure is dedicated to black gold, because that‚Äôs literally what it is, in industrial applications. Not to mention the other uses for natural oils and gasses. We will improve our technology, but I strongly believe people need to understand the real science and separate it from the science fiction. Hence the post. A battery is simply a way to store energy, but nothing can be more energy-dense than millions of years of intense pressure and heat forming organic material into oil, unless we look to nuclear reactions which I doubt would be considered safe en-masse by the public. A nuclear plane? Yah, imagine the crash‚Ä¶ Plus the heat that it would generate and the need for constant supervision by highly specialized scientists... you can see the problem. 

Google it if you don‚Äôt believe me. But these are hard facts I think everyone should appreciate and understand. Not that we shouldn‚Äôt keep pushing forward, but just understand some ideas are a bit further out than others. 254 W‚Ä¢h/kg VS 12,000 W‚Ä¢h/kg is a massive, massive difference in potential.",2024-02-12 11:45:20

green,1akxn4y,The Environmental Impact of Tourism,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/1akxn4y/the_environmental_impact_of_tourism/,1,"The environmental impact of tourism and travel is significant, with up to [1.3 billion tons](https://resource.co/article/managing-waste-tourist-cities-2023) of waste generated each year. As travelers explore new destinations, the demand for single-use plastics, packaging, and disposable items surges, contributing to pollution in both urban and natural environments. Improper disposal practices further exacerbate the problem, leading to litter and environmental degradation. The cumulative effect is the degradation of ecosystems, harm to wildlife, and the proliferation of non-biodegradable materials. 

To mitigate these impact,  adopting responsible travel practices is critical. Here are some ways on how to become a responsible and eco-friendly tourist:

1. **Choose Sustainable Transport:** Opt for eco-friendly transportation like trains, buses, or bikes to reduce your carbon footprint.
2. **Eco-Friendly Accommodations:** Stay in hotels or lodges that prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility.
3. **Pack Light:** Traveling with less luggage reduces fuel consumption, making your journey more environmentally friendly.
4. **Mindful Waste Management:** Di Stay in hotels or lodges prioritizing sustainability and environmental responsibility.
5. **Choose Local and Sustainable Products:** Support local businesses and choose products with minimal packaging to reduce waste.
6. **Reusable Travel Cutlery and Water Bottles:** Bring [reusable cutlery](https://plastic.education/reusable-cutlery-for-travel/) made of bamboo or stainless steel to avoid disposable utensils. Carry a reusable water bottle to avoid single-use plastic and stay hydrated on your travels.
7. **Educate Yourself:** Learn about the environmental impact of your destinations and make informed choices to minimize your ecological footprint.",2024-02-07 07:38:52

green,19b77ao,Green Party Releases Its Progressive Agenda Ahead of Hochul‚Äôs State of the State,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/19b77ao/green_party_releases_its_progressive_agenda_ahead/,0,"**Green Party Releases Its Progressive Agenda Ahead of Hochul‚Äôs State of the State**¬†

1/9/24 - The Green Party of New York said that Governor Hochul‚Äôs State of the State failed to lay out the bold action needed to deal with the multiple crisis facing New York. ‚ÄúThe Governor remains more committed to protecting her campaign donors rather than making the investments needed to lift up the average New Yorkers, many of whom continue to face significant economic challenges following the COVID epidemic. Threats to democracy and to the well-being of the average New Yorkers remains a bipartisan effort,‚Äù said Peter LaVenia, co-chair of the Green Party.

The Greens released its progressive agenda for 2024, including ballot access reform to restore third party political rights, enacting Ranked Choice Voting and proportional representation, passing single-payer universal healthcare, and needed housing reforms including rent control, constructing a million units of publicly owned social housing, and good-cause eviction. The party argued for immediate action on climate change, and said that taxing the rich, including stopping the rebate of the Stock Transfer Tax, would help pay for needed reforms and social program expansion including reinvestment in impacted communities.

While the Party was encouraged that the Governor is proposing at least part of the NY Heat Act to curtail the promotion of and subsidies for fossil fuels, they criticized the Hochul administration for failing to meet the deadlines laid out in the state's new climate law on how it plans to meet its relatively weak goals to reduce global emissions. According to a recent report by Dr. James Hansen, the world will have already passed the target of 1.5 degrees C warming before NY even adopts its legally required plan on how to reduce emissions. ‚ÄúNo wonder the UN has said that governments' slow climate action has opened up the Gates of Hell. And delaying Hochul‚Äôs weak carbon pricing plan just allows more fuel to be thrown into the fire,‚Äù noted Mark Dunlea of the EcoAction Committee of the U.S. Green Party.

Hochul did lay out a number of small but important climate steps, but fell far short of treating the situation as a climate emergency. Noticeably absent was any mention the Hochul intended to have NYPA launched a major expansion of publicly owned renewable energy as authorized in last year‚Äôs budget, nor was there any mention of public ownership of the transmission grid. While Hochul has indicated that $3 billion a year will be raised by how delayed cap-and-trade program, her speech fell far short on outlining a plan to begin investing the $10 to $20 billion of annual funding needed for a rapid transition to clean energy. She did announce support for making polluters to pay for the damages they have caused, such as enacting the Climate Superfund Act. The Party wished that her Solar for All was actually for all residents. It also supports far greater funding for environmental justice and Just Transition programs.

‚ÄúThe climate emergency is at a crucial point. We must solve the climate crisis so that our children have a chance for a decent future. The Green New Deal, which we first called for in Howie Hawkins‚Äô 2010 gubernatorial race, will also meet the economic needs of our state‚Äôs residents. Single payer health care would reduce overall healthcare spending while ensuring that everyone‚Äôs health care needs, including COVID, are met,‚Äù added Dunlea.¬†

In addition to funding Green New Deal initiatives, the Greens call for an ecosocialist Green New Deal to move rapidly towards a renewable energy economy. The party said it strongly opposes Gov. Hochul‚Äôs cap-and-trade solution and that the CLCPA was an example of the Democrat‚Äôs tepid response to the worsening climate catastrophe. They called for major subsidies to enact rapid decarbonization of all buildings in the state including heat pumps, geothermal, and energy conservation. Greens called for a rapid expansion of funds for mass transit and that all new vehicles should be electric by 2030.¬† The Greens want a target date of zero emissions as soon as possible (2030), rather than the 30-year goal under the state law, which would still allow emissions to be 15% of 1990 levels. The Greens back an immediate halt to all new fossil fuel infrastructure, increased public ownership and democratic control of the energy system and a robust carbon tax in all sectors to make polluters pay for the damages they cause with fossil fuels.

The Greens said that New York State must become a gold standard for electoral reform. They mentioned that New York is an outlier in recent years, as most states have loosened ballot access laws rather than restricting them. Reform of ballot access laws would give New Yorkers more choices and help combat the widespread and continual corruption in state government from both the Democrats and Republicans.

‚ÄúDemocracy continues to be in a fragile condition in New York and nationwide, with both parties engaged in corruption and suppression of democratic rights. Cuomo used the cover of COVID to kill independent small parties in the state budget. We demand the so-called progressive Democrats with a Legislative supermajority who told us they opposed what was happening to have the courage to stand up and do what is right for New Yorkers. That includes raising the taxes on billionaires and other rich New Yorkers to close the massive budget deficit from COVID,‚Äù said¬† Gloria Mattera, state party co-chair.

‚ÄúGovernor Hochul‚Äôs attempt to legalize Accessory Dwelling Units and force municipalities to build housing hit a roadblock last year because it was dependent on *private* *property* interests doing so. As a party we agree that housing reform is absolutely necessary, but the only way to get there is through *public investment and ownership* of housing. We need a committed program of *public social housing* that provides a million units for working-class and middle-class families across the state. Additionally, we need to pass strong tenant protection like rent control, good-cause eviction, and legalizing Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to shift away from the bankrupt suburban, single-family home model,‚Äù added Mattera.

The Greens have also been long-term proponents of stopping the multi-billion dollar annual rebate of the Stock Transfer Tax. ‚ÄúIt is long past time we make the rich pay their fair share of taxes, instead of making New York the long-time leader in economic inequality. We won‚Äôt solve the climate crisis or systemic racism or a host of other social problems until we embrace ecosocialism, putting the needs of average people and the planet ahead of the profits and well-being of a few,‚Äù said Peter LaVenia, state party co-chair.",2024-01-20 08:29:30

https://www.mic.com/impact/forget-your-carbon-footprint-lets-talk-about-your-climate-shadow

>Almost 20 years ago, a clever campaign by BP [brought us the concept](https://www.mic.com/impact/forget-your-carbon-footprint-lets-talk-about-your-climate-shadow) of the carbon footprint, a now-ubiquitous tool that‚Äôs supposed to help you calculate how much you are personally contributing to climate change. Depending on which calculator you use, your ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù might take into account your electricity usage, how many miles you drive and the gas mileage of your car, your water usage, your eating habits, how much you fly, and how much garbage you accumulate. Some calculators offer helpful tips ‚Äî like switching out your light bulbs or hanging your clothes to dry ‚Äî or let you compare your carbon footprint to other households in your zip code.

>The problem with the carbon footprint is that, as the example of the climate scientist and the oil industry marketer show, our footprints don‚Äôt paint an accurate picture of our true individual impact on the climate crisis. And by encouraging eco-minded people to use their carbon footprints as a ‚Äúguide‚Äù to fight climate change, we risk them spending all of their energy on low-impact individual actions that are easy to quantify, like recycling or turning off lights, instead of putting that energy toward broader, more meaningful work, like lobbying local politicians or speaking up at work about wasteful practices. Imagine if Greta Thunberg had decided to devote her attention to using less water or ditching dairy products instead of creating #FridaysforFuture.

Then look at this: 

https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham

>‚ÄúThis is one of the most successful, deceptive PR campaigns maybe ever,‚Äù said Benjamin Franta, who researches law and history of science as a J.D.-Ph.D. student at Stanford Law School.

It seems like there were two possible approaches to emissions. One that would put the attention and burden on the individual, and another that would **put the attention and burden on BP**. But regarding what I just put in bold text in the previous sentence, what exactly would that BP-unfriendly approach be that BP was so worried about and that BP wanted to use the concept ""carbon footprint"" to prevent? 

I recognize the shortcomings of focusing on your lifestyle; it removes you from activism. But I don't get what BP was so afraid of. I guess BP's fear might be related to this comment from Elizabeth Warren though I'm not fully sure: 

>""That's what they want us to talk about. This is your problem. They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around the lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers,"" Warren said. ""When 70 percent of the pollution of the carbon that we are throwing into the air comes from three industries and we can set our targets and say by 2028, 2030, and 2035 no more. Think about that.""

One point you could make is that those who want to delay decarbonization love it when people focus on their lifestyles because focus on lifestyles delays any actual political pressure on governments. And the political pressure is what the hydrocarbon sector fears. But: 

- (1) I'm not sure if there's any literature that talks about this ""delay political action"" aspect of people focusing on their personal habits

- (2) I'm not sure if anything I quote above is making this point when they talk about BP's vague and unexplained fear of an alternative approach",2023-10-29 18:45:43

Did you know that 30-40% of all food produced globally is wasted and this accounts for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions? It's crazy and we stand to gain a lot beyond just the environmental benefits from solving this problem, including saving a good deal of money!  

My friends and I are building an app called [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) aimed at addressing this issue. In developed countries households account for half of all food waste, so if we can make it easier to make the most of the food we bring home then we can make a big dent in the overall issue of food waste.  Enter [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts), the ""digital kitchen assistant"" we're building to help you find recipes, plan out meals, generate shopping lists, and track and fully utilize what's in your pantry. 

You can either use it to do full blown meal planning, or just enter a few items you already have that need to be used up to get a plethora of personalized ideas on how to use them. Even simple things like using the pantry to remind you when those perishable items need to be used up can make a big difference.  

The app is free and we're still early in our journey, so if you're so inclined we'd love it if you gave it a try and let us know what you think!",2023-09-05 12:58:48

Big tech seems to believe that you must throw away barely used completely functional tech equipment that can be used in 3rd and 2nd world countries even in 1st world. 

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dexon Computer, Inc. was founded in 1992 to supply computer hardware to businesses. Our guiding principle is that our customers have the right to choose what they want for their IT environments. We help design creative solutions to fit within their budget. Choices may consist of new hardware, refurbished, or a combination. Different manufacturers. Our goal is only to serve the customer. Outstanding service and solutions at a fair price and one-stop customer service are the reasons we have earned your business.        
 

It‚Äôs a simple right for any person or company to make their own purchasing decisions. Customers have their reasons for who earns their business. We work hard to earn the privilege of being a trusted vendor. Our goal is to keep that relationship.  
 

And yet, Cisco believes they should dictate which of their suppliers the customer is allowed to purchase from. The privilege to purchase their equipment. This is where the problems begin.  
 

Have you been told you can‚Äôt purchase from a specific vendor? Only Cisco‚Äôs authorized VARs? If you don‚Äôt, your items won‚Äôt be eligible for SMARTnet, or you may incur the after-the-fact practice and cost of an ‚ÄúInspection fee?‚Äù Or have you been told that hardware or software purchased from the secondary market will introduce security risks into your network in an attempt to create ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù or ‚Äúfear, uncertainty, and doubt‚Äù in your ability to buy from whomever you choose?  
 

We now realize this charade is part of their game‚Äîthey‚Äôd rather coerce you into purchasing their new product from their overpriced distributor by scaring you into thinking you will have a security problem if you don‚Äôt. Perhaps, Cisco took your money for a SmartNet agreement, and after the equipment has been running well for years, they remove the equipment from the SmartNet agreement when they ‚Äúfind out‚Äù that you purchased it from an independent reseller. And they kept taking your payments. Yep, this happened to our customer saving lives in Texas.  
 

Control. Coercion by fear. Bullying too many times to count.  
 

If this describes your experience, we would love to hear from you. **That‚Äôs why Dexon Computer, Inc. has filed an antitrust suit against Cisco in Texas.** Their monopoly and coercing business tactics need to stop. You have the right to purchase where you want. You have the right to buy refurbished. You have the right to sell the hardware you no longer need. And you have the right to repair.  
 

Back to the original question, are we the land of the free? Or only if you are wealthy enough not to be slowly crushed by their litigation? All 26 of us at Dexon are doing our best to fight back. You can imagine the disparity against a 200 billion company that dominates over 60% of the market. Their lawyers outnumber our employees. Their goal seems to be to put us out of business by drowning us in lawyer fees. So why is our little company so threatening?  
 

Because we refuse to give in to their bullying. And so should you.  
 

Tell us your stories. Let‚Äôs be the home of the brave. Blow the whistle. Help us fight for the right to reuse. It‚Äôs good for the planet. It‚Äôs good for your budget. **It‚Äôs good not to be bullied.**   
 

Thank you for your continued business and support. It means the world to us.

I last posted here about this around a month ago and given the positive response I figured I'd continue to put out the good word. Food waste accounts for nearly 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, it's the largest component of waste in landfills, and food that isn't eaten accounts for about a quarter of all freshwater used in the U.S. The list of impacts is long.

My friends and I are building an app called [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) to help fight food waste! We‚Äôve all found that meal planning has really helped us eat better, save money, and cut down on our food waste. After using several recipe sourcing, grocery shopping, inventory / pantry management, and meal planning apps we realized that all the apps out there seem to only do part of the job.  

Our goal is to generate personalized meal plans that consider your budgetary, dietary, taste, and cooking preferences, track and incorporate ingredients you have on hand to minimize waste, and generate easy to use grocery lists that don‚Äôt break the bank.

Check us out at [www.budgeat.app](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) and if you‚Äôre interested download the app to give us a try! We're still early in our journey so just having more people try the app and provide feedback is immensely helpful. The app is currently only available in the U.S., but we're working hard to expand coverage.",2023-08-04 13:21:36

CUDOS' commitment to sustainable cloud computing is commendable and aligns with the growing awareness of the environmental impact of technology. By adopting a decentralized approach to cloud infrastructure, CUDOS will likely contribute to reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Traditional data centers are energy-intensive, so distributing resources across nodes can alleviate the strain on power resources.

Furthermore, responsible resource management is crucial in mitigating the electronic waste problem. CUDOS proactively reduces e-waste and its harmful environmental effects by optimizing hardware usage and promoting longevity.

Blockchain technology can add another layer of transparency and trust to the cloud ecosystem. Data integrity is essential, especially as cloud computing becomes integral to various industries, including those handling sensitive information.

CUDOS can inspire other technology providers to follow suit by setting an environmentally conscious cloud computing standard. As society increasingly relies on digital solutions, ensuring these advancements are made with sustainability is vital.

However, as with any technological solution, it is essential to consider the practical implementation and the actual impact of CUDOS. Sustainability efforts should be continuously evaluated and optimized to make a significant difference in the long run. Collaboration with other industry players, policymakers, and environmental organizations can strengthen the overall impact and create a more sustainable cloud computing future.

green,158o8aa,green,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/158o8aa/green/,2,"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago‚Äînever mind how long precisely‚Äîhaving little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people‚Äôs hats off‚Äîthen, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

&#x200B;

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs‚Äîcommerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

&#x200B;

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?‚ÄîPosted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster‚Äîtied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?

&#x200B;

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand‚Äîmiles of them‚Äîleagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues‚Äînorth, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

&#x200B;

Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries‚Äîstand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.

&#x200B;

But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd‚Äôs head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd‚Äôs eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies‚Äîwhat is the one charm wanting?‚ÄîWater‚Äîthere is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.

&#x200B;

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick‚Äîgrow quarrelsome‚Äîdon‚Äôt sleep of nights‚Äîdo not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;‚Äîno, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,‚Äîthough I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board‚Äîyet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;‚Äîthough once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

&#x200B;

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one‚Äôs sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.

&#x200B;

What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain‚Äôt a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about‚Äîhowever they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way‚Äîeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other‚Äôs shoulder-blades, and be content.

&#x200B;

Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,‚Äîwhat will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

&#x200B;

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way‚Äîhe can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:

&#x200B;

‚ÄúGrand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. ‚ÄúWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. ‚ÄúBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces‚Äîthough I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.

&#x200B;

Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it‚Äîwould they let me‚Äîsince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

&#x200B;

By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.",2023-07-24 21:47:58

\- Researchers at The University of Texas in Austin have uncovered an enzyme, FAST-PETase, that can swiftly break down plastic waste, offering a potential revolution in waste management.

\- FAST-PETase is a modified version of PETase, a natural enzyme known for degrading PET plastics commonly used in food packaging and bottles.

\- This innovative enzyme shows promise in addressing the global plastic waste crisis, which currently sees only 10% of plastic being recycled.

&#x200B;

 A Sustainable Answer to Plastic Pollution

\- With plastic waste accounting for 8% of all solid waste globally and most plastic not being recycled, FAST-PETase presents an energy-efficient and rapid solution to this environmental challenge.

\- Bacteria armed with FAST-PETase can decompose plastic waste that would take almost 500 years to degrade in landfills, transforming it into reusable base units.

\- The enzyme's low energy requirements make it a game-changer in reducing pollution and lessening the environmental impact of plastic disposal.

&#x200B;

Paving the Way for a Circular Plastics Economy

\- Hal Alper, a professor of Chemical Engineering at UT Austin, highlights the endless possibilities of this discovery, extending beyond waste management to various industries recycling their products.

\- A circular plastics economy, characterized by reduced waste and pollution, is envisioned, where plastic waste is efficiently recycled into useful products, promoting sustainability.

\- The new enzyme's capabilities could lead to cleaner landfills, sustainable practices in high-waste industries, and the restoration of polluted natural areas, contributing to a greener planet.

&#x200B;

Scaling Up for Real-World Impact

\- The scientists at UT Austin are scaling up production for practical applications, with plans to deploy the enzyme in cleaning up landfills, high-waste industries, and polluted environments.

\- This groundbreaking discovery offers hope for combating plastic pollution and transforming the linear economy into a circular system that values efficient recycling and sustainability.

green,14zj2zv,The Longevity of Plastic Bags and Their Environmental Impact,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/14zj2zv/the_longevity_of_plastic_bags_and_their/,1,"* Plastic bags take approximately 1000 years to decompose, but they actually photodegrade from ultraviolet radiation rather than being consumed by microorganisms.
* Even when plastic bags disintegrate, they leave behind harmful microplastics that continue to affect the environment.
* The estimate of 1000 years is based on respirometry tests and not real-time observations, as plastic bags have only been around since the 1950s.

**The Environmental Costs of Plastic Bags**

* In addition to their long decomposition time, plastic bags have an environmental cost in their production, which requires fossil fuels, particularly oil.
* Once discarded, plastic bags can enter the wildlife food web, as animals like birds and fish consume them, leading to accumulation along the food chain.
* Reusing existing bags, whether cloth or plastic, is a better alternative to constantly acquiring new bags, as even cloth totes have a significant carbon footprint that takes thousands of uses to offset.

**Making Sustainable Choices Beyond Plastic Bag Usage**

* While reducing the use of plastic bags is important, it is essential to consider other sustainable habits beyond switching to cloth bags.
* Choosing to reuse the bags already available at home, whether they are cloth or plastic, can be a more practical and environmentally friendly solution.
* Making small changes in behavior, such as using existing bags and being conscious of overall consumption, can contribute to a positive environmental impact.

* Study reveals that plastic pollution affects all coral reefs, with deeper reefs having higher amounts of plastic debris.
* Majority of larger items found on coral reefs are ""ghost gear,"" including ropes, lines, and nets used in fishing.
* Plastic pollution poses an emerging threat to already stressed coral reefs affected by the climate crisis and overfishing.

**Study Findings and Impact**

* The research examined 85 reefs across the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans, including deeper sites at depths of 150 meters.
* Plastic debris was observed to increase with depth, contrary to expectations, as deeper reefs are farther from sources of plastic pollution.
* Plastic pollution can lead to coral disease, damage reef structure, and negatively impact fish abundance and diversity.

**Recommendations for Addressing Plastic Pollution**

* The study emphasizes the need to expand marine protected areas to include mesophotic reefs, update international agreements on plastic pollution to include fishing gear, and develop biodegradable alternatives.
* Locations closer to densely populated areas and marine protected areas showed higher levels of plastic pollution.
* The worst-affected location, Comoros, had nearly 84,500 items of plastic per square kilometer, while the least polluted was the Marshall Islands, with approximately 580 pieces per square kilometer.

I last posted here about this around a month ago and given the positive response I figured I'd continue to put out the good word. 

Food waste accounts for nearly 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, it's the largest component of waste in landfills, and food that isn't eaten accounts for about a quarter of all freshwater used in the U.S.  My friends and I are building an app called [Budgeat](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) to help fight food waste! 

We‚Äôve all found that meal planning has really helped us eat better, save money, and cut down on our food waste. After using several recipe sourcing, grocery shopping, inventory / pantry management, and meal planning apps we realized that all the apps out there seem to only do part of the job.  

Our goal is to generate personalized meal plans that consider your budgetary, dietary, taste, and cooking preferences, track and incorporate ingredients you have on hand to minimize waste, and generate easy to use grocery lists that don‚Äôt break the bank.

Check us out at [www.budgeat.app](https://www.budgeat.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=reddit_posts) and if you‚Äôre interested download the app to give us a try! We're still early in our journey so just having more people try the app and provide feedback is immensely helpful.

Two years ago, I started investigating the complex world of carbon offsets , specifically in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU). At the time, I was conducting climate research and I quickly recognized the absence of a convenient tool for efficient data comparison across regions, project types, and databases. The absence of such a tool slowed down my work and highlighted a wider issue of information accessibility for carbon offset data.

In response to this, in 2023 I developed [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/) , an online platform bridging this information gap. It provides a user-friendly interface for rapid, global carbon offset data comparisons, catering to various project and regional interests. It's a free service aimed at benefiting the larger environmental community. Whether you're a professional researcher, a sustainability professional, a student, or simply curious about carbon offsets, I invite you to try [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/). I share this resource in the hope that it will be beneficial to many of you, aiding your research, studies, or simply satisfying your curiosity.

The web app works best on desktop, but it should still be functional on mobile!  


Changes in the last month!

1. I have added interactive charts with credit retirement data. The charts are made on the fly with the actual retirement data for each project, so what you see is actually based on the serialized retirement data for each credit transaction.
2. I have completely reworked the Icon system, now it is based on a three icon grouping of Nature-based projects, Energy/Efficiency projects, and Industrial projects. The icon size relates to the size of estimated annual emission reductions attributable to the project. The sizes of the markers are based on the statistical distribution of all the projects. Additionally, I have added project titles below the markers.
3. Usability improvements such as improvements to the Legend, document linking, button aesthetics, project count, and more regular database updates.

If you're curious to learn more about the project their is a blogpost linked at the bottom of the map (i symbol).

Below is a draft of our formal mission statement.  

MISSION STATEMENT 

In order to rebuild the Green Party Of New York, outreach must be a primary feature. The short-term goal of outreach is to increase those who vote Green and those who register Green, and the long-term goal of outreach is to increase those who work Green and those who run Green. Therefore, outreach must be a deliberate form of messaging to individuals and groups that are outside of the Green Party but who may agree with our platform and are disgusted with the two-party system. Three methods of outreach that have had a long history of success are ad campaigns, campus tabling, and phonebanking or textbanking. The Green Party Of New York has not been as diligent as it should be with these methods over the past several years, and this has been a possible factor in our decline. It becomes necessary to make a general Green Party ad campaign, campus tabling, and phonebanking or textbanking a regular periodic yearly activity in order to rebuild the party. It is also a necessity to insure it gets done every year. By yearly it is meant that these methods of outreach should be done every year from now on into the future. The party should repeat this process every year in order to keep outreach strong, regardless of whether or not any candidates are running in any particular year. To organize this yearly activity, the Outreach Working Group must be formed. 

Ad Campaign:

1. Develop written scripts for ads that are imaginative and informative.

2. Make use of platforms such as TikTok to create the ad in the most efficient and inexpensive way possible.

3. Release the ad through social media in the early part of each year.

4. Explore the possibility of releasing the ad for television or radio, taking into consideration cost and media outlet concentrations throughout the state.

Campus Tabling:

1. Contact all colleges and universities in the state inquiring about their policies for allowing campus tabling by outside groups.

2. Do followup with local Greens and those colleges and universities that have more open policies on campus tabling.

3. Organize with local Greens to schedule campus tabling and provide necessary materials.

4. Develop a contingency plan of direct postcard mailings to students through their residence hall mailboxes for those colleges and universities that have restrictive campus tabling policies.

Phonebanking And Textbanking:

1. Prepare Nationbuilder for phonebanking and textbanking every Autumn.

2. Send out recruitment call for phonebanking and textbanking through the volunteer list, e-blasts, and social media by early Summer at the latest.

3. Determine whether the phonebanking and textbanking message will be about candidates, fundraising, a particular event, a particular issue, or a particular piece of pending legislation.

4. Record phonebanking and textbanking feedback for future analysis.",2023-06-20 05:52:22

I'm seeking your insights and opinions on the creation of a performance metric for carbon offset projects at [**www.offsetmap.com**](http://www.offsetmap.com/). I believe that community feedback is crucial in ensuring the development of a fair and effective system for judging.

I pulled the survey options from the major judging criteria of existing rating standards, such as [www.offsetguide.org](https://www.offsetguide.org/) and [www.carboncreditquality.org](https://www.carboncreditquality.org/), and a few other organizations.

By participating in this ranked poll, you can help establish the weights for a metric that will measure project performance. Your input will help shape the criteria that projects will be evaluated against, ensuring that they meet the highest standards.

If you feel like any additional criteria should be considered in the metric weights, feel free to share your idea(s)

I last posted here about this around a month ago and given the positive response I figured I'd continue to put out the good word. Food waste accounts for nearly 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, it's the largest component of waste in landfills, and food that isn't eaten accounts for about a quarter of all freshwater used in the U.S.

After using several recipe sourcing, grocery shopping, inventory / pantry management, and meal planning apps we realized that all the apps out there seem to only do part of the job.  

Our goal is to generate personalized meal plans that consider your budgetary, dietary, taste, and cooking preferences, track and incorporate ingredients you have on hand to minimize waste, and generate easy to use grocery lists that don‚Äôt break the bank.

They have 1 or 2 meeting days where face-to-face collaboration makes sense, but otherwise don't physically need to be next to anymore the vast majority of the time. Most modern office work is done all on computer; paper is shrinking. Thus the office can require everyone in a related group come in on ""meeting days"", but the rest of the days can be work-at-home.

However, managers often hate change, and invent excuses not to. They **need external pressure** to get them off their outmoded thinking. Can ""green"" political groups help with that?

Note there are studies to suggest that telecommuting doesn't reduce driving much because people often run errands before or after work on the way to or from work. They'd have to drive longer to do the same errands.  But *partial* telecommuting solves most of that because people will schedule and run most such errands on their in-office days. In other words, stats for pure telecommuting don't necessarily apply the partial telecommuting.

Two years ago, I started investigating the complex world of carbon offsets , specifically in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU). At the time, I was conducting climate research and I quickly recognized the absence of a convenient tool for efficient data comparison across regions, project types, and databases. The absence of such a tool slowed down my work and highlighted a wider issue of information accessibility for carbon offset data.

In response to this, in 2023 I developed [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/) , an online platform bridging this information gap. It provides a user-friendly interface for rapid, global carbon offset data comparisons, catering to various project and regional interests. It's a free service aimed at benefiting the larger environmental community, and I welcome any feedback to improve its functionality. Whether you're a professional researcher, a sustainability professional, a student, or simply curious about carbon offsets, I invite you to try [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/). More than anything, I share this resource in the hope that it will be beneficial to many of you, aiding your research, studies, or simply satisfying your curiosity.

It would be useful to hear about the different use cases for the web app, so if you have any feedback in that regard it would be really appreciated.

green,13a38o7,Can you guys help with some ideias for a research grant for Sustainable tech linked to agriculture/rural areas?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/13a38o7/can_you_guys_help_with_some_ideias_for_a_research/,4," 

So my university posted a grant for developing technology and creating products linked to green tech and/or agriculture and i am super excited to take part in that, not only to have a positive impact in the world but also to get some hands on exp.

My background is as a CS undergrad and the grant talks about AI, IoT, sensors and a lot of tech that i am interested in so thats a plus! I am also Brazilian.

i had some ideias like:

1. Creating an easy-to-acess database of modern and sustainable farming techniques for people in rural areas to use, both to help farming and the environment.

2) improving the acess to the carbon credit market for our farmers and rural people, since thats a growing market (especially with all the interest around the amazon greenforest) but not many people here know about that.

3) Something to help optimize the use of water around large platantions, especially soy plantations which consume a lot of water.

any other ideas? i am excited to see the discussion and sharing of ideas here!",2023-05-06 21:48:31

Previous summary : I would like to know how to find out if a company is really committed to the environment

Hello, I'm a chemical engineering student from Brazil and I want to use my profession to contribute to environmental and social issues.

However, it is not enough just to have this will, it is necessary to have a materialistic and practical conception of reality, so I have been reflecting a lot on which branch of industry this impact would be more significant.

Incredibly, I love Polymers / ""plastics"", and yes I am fully aware that an individual person cannot make major changes, political organization is essential, as well as working for a company regardless of how ""responsible"" it is, it is inherently inserted in the logic of the overexploitation capital of natural resources.

Despite everything, I have found the multinational Braskem interesting, which at least appears to have a large investment in the research and production of biopolymers, but I wanted to do more in-depth research on it, find out how true its performance is and especially how it relates to the communities, even more so because there are other departments that work with conventional plastics.",2023-03-25 22:40:19

It's a new music & arts festival in Boston that's currently raising money to power as much of the event off clean energy as possible! (there's more to it, but I figured this part would appeal most to this subreddit)

The Kickstarter needs a lot of help though right now, it's at 15% of its goal with only 20 days left! (Kickstarter is all or nothing, so if the goal isn't met, they get NOTHING!)

There's a fun video on the Kickstarter that explains what they're all about

If you like music and arts events and believe they need to be doing more to take care of the environment and attendees then maybe this will speak to you!

It's called [Gumbo](https://gumbo.co.uk), and it's a website that helps people reduce food waste by making it easier to find recipes that use up the ingredients they already have.

You basically enter the ingredients you have on hand, specify your dietary requirements, and Gumbo gives you delicious meal recommendations from across the internet.

The site is not-for-profit and totally free to use. There's no advertising or sneaky marketing on the site, just a passion for cooking and a way to improve my programming skills.

As someone who cares deeply about food waste and reducing my environmental impact, I'm really proud of what I‚Äôve built. I‚Äôve put a lot of time and energy into making Gumbo as user-friendly and effective as possible, and I‚Äôm always working to improve the search algorithms and make it even easier to find great recipes.

If you're intrigued and want to give Gumbo a try, head over to [https://gumbo.co.uk](https://gumbo.co.uk). I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback and ideas for how to make Gumbo even better in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and happy cooking!",2023-03-07 11:22:45

I stumbled upon this company called Cyclups that I think is worth sharing with the community. They're doing something really interesting by making straws and cutlery from PLQ, which is a material made from wheat. It's really cool because it can replace traditional plastics in injection molding and extrusion, and it comes in various strengths and compostability times.

What's even more impressive is that Cyclups is taking things one step further by moving from biodegradable to compostable non-plastic, which means there's no waste and the end product can actually be used as fertilizer for soil. It's a really innovative solution to a growing problem, and I'm excited to see where this company goes.

This survey is on governmental schemes on solar energy in increasing the use of renewable energy resources. The use of solar energy in our daily lives can greatly help in protecting our environment. However, it is not that easy to install solar panels and other necessary¬†equipment¬†to harness solar energy in our homes. Today, many governments have brought solar energy schemes to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce pollution and climate change. Solar energy schemes could help a lot in urging people to invest in solar energy and contribute to environmental protection.¬†

This survey is for my college research. It would be of great help if you could spare some of your valuable time for filling my survey. This survey is anonymous and confidential.

Thank you so much!

I‚Äôm familiar with a growing number of artists who try to be green or at minimum offset their carbon emissions, but I am restricted to only listening to media created through environmentally friendly means.",2023-01-06 02:18:51

It turns out the subject feels rather boring in that sub: *it is what it is*, and few people even care enough to comment on the topic.

**My question to you**: did I just discover hot water? In other words, is this a known issue I wasn't aware of?

I honestly believe we're wasting a surprising amount of energy on paused PC games. I think changing gamers' behavior would make a difference. Moreover, I believe pushing game developers to optimize their games as to be more energy efficient would make even more of a difference.

What do you know on the topic? Just as important, what's your opinion on the topic? **Please share your opinion**, even if you think this makes no sense ‚Äì I really want to gauge people's emotions on this topic!",2022-12-20 19:24:14
