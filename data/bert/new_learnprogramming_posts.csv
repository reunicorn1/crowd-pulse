learnprogramming,1gpt0fz,Insights from an ex-Googler who has taught 1000s of Engineers about DSA interviews,264,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gpt0fz/insights_from_an_exgoogler_who_has_taught_1000s/,12,"I interviewed Alvin Zablan, an ex-Google engineer who has taught thousands of people about data structures and algorithms. He's seen countless engineers pass and fail interviews at top tech companies, so his insights can make a big difference in your preparation.

The first thing Alvin recommended is that you need a learning roadmap. Many engineers start doing random problems without a direction or an understanding of underlying patterns. There's an infinite universe of possible DSA questions, so it's crucial to categorize the problems you're asked.

Within each category, ensure you have a deep understanding of various techniques. Alvin recommends starting with the basics like strings, arrays, and basic HashMap problems. These rarely give people a hard time, but you should master them before moving on.

After that, here are the **5 core concepts** that will give you excellent coverage of many DSA problems:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** The first building block of graph traversal.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The second building block of graph traversal.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
4. **Recursive Backtracking:** Explore multiple solutions and backtrack when needed.
5. **Two Pointer:** Efficiently iterate through arrays or linked lists.

One of the biggest things Alvin stressed is to focus on mastery of these concepts. The philosophy you should adopt is the 80/20 rule, where 20% of the input will give you 80% of the output. That means for these 20% **most common** ideas, you should go very deep.

Be able to explain the solution in detail, identify alternate solutions, and explain what bugs would emerge with simple changes to the algorithm. If you do this, not only will you be much better prepared for interviews, but you'll also have tons of confidence for anything new you might see.

A few other key takeaways:

* **Learning comes before practice**: Leetcode is for practicing your DSA skills, not for learning them. Learning happens if you can read or watch a detailed explanation. You should feel empowered to watch and re-watch tutorials until you truly 'get it.'
* **Practice mindfully:** Solve problems to solidify your understanding, not just for the sake of solving them. Instead of giving up on a problem after a few minutes of struggle, give yourself a hint by watching the first 30 seconds of the solution and then struggling more.

Happy to answer questions or share my own perspective as a Staff Engineer in Big Tech in the comments :)

learnprogramming,1gprmz2,Am I too stupid for programming? Genuine question.,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gprmz2/am_i_too_stupid_for_programming_genuine_question/,164,"Hello everyone,

I'm 22/F and decided to study software engineering at an university. I've enjoyed it up until now.

Right now, we use **Pascal** as a programming language. Yes. **Pascal.** There are literally SO LITTLE resources for pascal online. There are no online courses like leetcode or anything for pascal, only for like python or stuff but I dont know anything about its syntax.

We have a course called ""Datastructures and Algorithms"" which is connected to the module ""programming"". We always get programming exercises that we need to solve with the stuff we talked about in the previous lesson.

For example, the last two lessons we talked about arrays: I understood the concept of the index, how to go through an array, etc.

BUT heres the problem: I find our homework so so hard. I find it's almost impossible for me to solve. I feel so stupid.

1. I don't know how to begin, I don't know where to begin. I don't know how to break the problem down into smaller problems, I don't know when it's small enough to put it into code.

And when I ""know"" how to solve a problem, after hours, days, weeks of trying, failing, being frustrated it doesnt work the way I want it to work and the entire code is useless because one part specifically doesn't work the way I want it to work.

2. nested loops with arrays confuse me A LOT. When do I have to use for loops, when do I have to use while loops? Essentially I know, that for loops are used for counting and while loops are used for doing something while a condition is true. However that doesnt always seem to be the case? Sorta?

When I get stuck on my homework, I ask chatgpt (yes, I know its bad, but what am I supposed to do? I have absolutely no idea) how to approach the problem. I send my code to chatgpt, it tells me what to improve, etc etc.. But sometimes I simply don't understand why or how chatgpt would code it like that.

I have many examples if someone wants to help me out and take a look at it (I would really, really appreciate that).

My classmates seem to grasp these concepts so, so fast and they take a maximum of 5 hours for an exercise, meanwhile I sit here for 20+ hours for ONE exercise. I just feel really, really dumb. Obviously it can't be that hard, otherwise our professors wouldnt give us these exercises. It's obviously doable, somehow. Am I lacking intelligence, creative thinking, what is it? I mean I know I'm not the brightest, but.. am I cooked?

I also end up procrastinating and feeling guilty over it because I dont know how to approach these problems and tasks. Its so hard for me. Is programming just not for me?

I also struggle with super simple algorithms like sorting an array, merging two arrays, reversing an array, removing duplicates from an sorted array, ... Like if you would ask me to do something like this, I wouldnt even know where to begin, or how to implement it.

Help, I really want to like it and be good at it.. but it seems so impossible :(",2024-11-12 18:28:15

I’m at a decision point between NestJS and .NET for a major backend project and need your input on long-term viability and stability.

My main concerns are:

1. Which framework is more likely to remain relevant in the next 5-10 years?
2. How do the communities for each compare in terms of support, growth, and contributions?
3. In terms of adoption, are there specific industry trends for either that make it a safer bet for future-proofing a project?

NestJS seems modern and compatible with other popular frontend frameworks, which I like, but I also know that .NET has a long track record in enterprise environments. Would love to hear from anyone who’s been working with either or both for some time!

but the output of this code is: 12000023 - 12000027; 12000048 - 12000052



the second range should be split to 12000048 - 12000050; 12000051 - 12000052.

now, i'm kind of confused where to put another 'if' or if i ever need one? i'm not sure if ""numbers\[i\] % 50 == 0""

I've found similar (pretty much exactly the same) projects online that I can follow along with but I feel like this is cheating somehow. And also if my project were to deviate from the projects I've found online I'm not sure I have a compass to guide me, I wouldn't know how to account for any discrepancies. 

I kinda want to know how I would even think to develop this project from scratch if I didn't have any access to any similar projects.

Hi I've been in the Video Editing Career  for last 5 years now. I'm working under a company with the relevant field. Plus, I sell my service on Fiverr. 

Recently I'm feeling like I'm losing all my sparks. Like no real progress, nothing. I used to be a guy try to explore and learn different things. But nowadays it feels like I'm not that much into learning and exploring things. Plus, for my work purpose I had to learn business management and that brings me so many opportunities of learning things like Meta, google ad marketing. But there's this one thing I was afraid of from the very beginning of choosing my career. Learning programming language. I've been asked on the interviews and in different places if I know web development or not. 


So I'm just thinking to start learning Web Development.. But I really really need your opinions and thoughts on this. Like should I really go for it at this age   (25). Is it too late for me? Like there's a massive competition out there.. So many graduates on this specific niche. 


Let me know your thoughts. Thank you",2024-11-13 07:19:55

[https://pypi.org/project/quik\_db/](https://pypi.org/project/quik_db/)

I built this stupid ++ useless library called quik-db. It basically just creates database connections from a config file. Can do a some of the things sqlalchemy does, but with raw sql. (Add offset, limit). Fetch via chaining, executing stored procedures by name (and adding schemas automatically) alongside model validation.

Like I said, useless. But that's not the point. Its more about the process of building it for me and here's why.

Synopsis:

* I'm a senior systems/data analyst/othertypeofengineer
* I started coding to fill some gaps in a new team at a new company.
* \+1 year later, manager quit, we finally got moved to IT (we did IT related work and development on the business side)
   * new team is java....
* \+1 year after that, I have junior devs, but I've never had a senior dev/engineer myself, after being one for 2+ years.
* I built a useless library because I could. And I wanted to learn. Cuz nothing at my current company requires anything remotely as complex.
* I want people to critique it.

I'm a self-taught software engineer/dev. Basically just googled stuff. Then I found out about how you can just look at the libraries and reverse engineer them. Just in the last 6 months, I've learned what code linters do. And how debug consoles work. Yes, it took me over 1.5 years cuz I was focused on other things, like learning what classes are. Then types. And the list goes on forever. AI has helped TREMENDOUSLY, but its not enough. I want to be even better. Developing code was just a means to solving some things I wanted to automate. Now I'm getting into AI and data engineering. I've built a few things in that space, but I want others to critique my work first and tell me what I did shitty and what I can improve on.

I recently completed and deployed a project, using Vue.js on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend, hosted on AWS (S3, CloudFront, and EC2). Working on this project taught me a lot about cloud deployment, serverless hosting, and navigating various AWS services. The app is a unique twist on the Caesar Cipher, allowing custom encryption patterns for added complexity.

I'm sharing it here to get your feedback, suggestions, and advice on potential improvements. In particular, I’d love insights on how to make the project more scalable and secure.

Also, if my configuration files include production API URLs, is it standard to push these to a public repo? Or is there a best practice to keep private production settings out of the open-source code while still providing enough configuration for contributors to work locally? Do I need separate repositories, or can this be managed effectively within a single repo?

I have no idea if I'm using this tool correctly, and I would love it if someone could help me figure that out. My workflow essentially is as follows:

1. Collect each definition by calling `to_z3()` in the appropriate module, which constructs a `RecFunction` that encodes the series generator
2. Gather each pairwise combination
3. For each of them, apply the following constraints, where `n` is an index in the sequence and `s_ref` is the base I'm outputting the sequence in:
  - `solver.add(ForAll(n, Implies(n >= 0, T1(n) == T2(n))))`
  - (new as of today) `solver.add(ForAll(n, Implies(And(n >= 0, n < s_ref), And(T1(n) == n, T2(n) == n))))`
  - (new as of today) `solver.add(T1(s_ref) == 1, T2(s_ref) == 1)`

If that's not the case, please let me know. Also, English isn't my native language, so forgive me if I have some mistakes here and there.

As title says, I have started to look for some books that I can give as a present to a high school student who is studying a ""technical career"" in CS^[1] but have no idea what an ideal, or appropriate book could be.

For some context: He already has some knowledge on CS (still learning) and has done some school related stuff/projects with Python, and C++ (so far) that have been kinda interesting.

However, although I know that he'll learn a lot of stuff in last High School year, as well during College, I was thinking on give him a career-related book that can be useful to learn some stuff that probably won't be mentioned *that much* during his school years, or stuff like that...

But have no idea what to choose, specially as I was thinking in avoid anything too tied to an specific language, or technology stack (I mean, his current choices could change, or they couldn't) and choose something more language/tech stack agnostic, if that makes sense.

Initially I was thinking in give him a copy of ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" (by David Thomas, and Andrew Hunt) as that is one of my favorite books that fits what I have in mind, but I am not quite sure if that won't be too much for his current academic/professional level.

So, based on this, do you have any recommendations that you could share?

Thanks in advance, and kind regards.

Layout's easy enough (2D array), but I don't know how to find out whether a game over has happened. I think I need a search algorithm but what kind? I've heard of breadth-first and depth-first searches but I don't know anything about them.

Any particular algorithm I should look into? No code examples, I want to implement things myself.",2024-11-12 15:33:57

Everything's constantly being updated as well, so I feel that flexibility plays a key role here.

By trade I have been a handyman, jack of all trades, if you will. I have bounced around from job to job simply because I feel like it. I prefer to do many things and learn a wide range of skills. This is ok in your 20s. Now I'm 35 with a wife and a baby. I was always going to focus on one career eventually and that time has come.

I've always wanted to work on video games. I used to make custom games in warcraft 3 in middle school and high school. Uploading custom assets, the map design, ""programming"" the game with wc3 world editor.

Recently, I've been learning to use Blender and Unity to try to create mods and assets for Parkitect, a Rollercoaster tycoon game.

I'm aware there aren't any certs that would allow me to do this professionally, but I can start with something vaguely related. The question is what?

During the pandemic, I completed a bootcamp called NuCamp for Fullstack web development. Now it's been a few years and I got too busy to stick with it and build my own websites, but I still have access to the courses. However, I'm thinking I'd be more interested in something else.

I fully intent to work from home or atleast a hybrid position. Some certificate option at my local university are Adobe design, AWS sysops admin, and Agile project management.

Do any of these get me any closer to working on video games? 
What does the day to day actually entail?
Are these certs you can actually get hired with?
Do you have to build a portfolio of your own projects before anyone will even consider hiring you?
Are there any other certs that would be ideal?

I would consider that as ""being an actual dev"" as it used to be before the gold rush. I'm not amateur but I cannot do a full E2E or APP with modern frameworks.

On my job I'm mainly doing some operational stuff for pipelining data so my job doesn't require programming at all, absolutely, most of the time the stuff is literally doing configs of an already preset really bad architected system, which is a motivational killer.

Trying to switch my job I got into an interview for some python development, which was pretty basic to do, had one error only and it was mainly because I coded it pretty fast, the problem was the interviewer asked me too much about my development environment, and I've always been the guy that code on plain text, mainly because before I had a job I couldn't afford a modern PC so any IDE was absolutely trash to boot, so I stuck with basic text editors like notepad++, sublime text, and atom, and run everything through the terminal.

Basically I got bounced for my lack of dev environment, I don't know anything about debugging tools (I used only a Turbo ASM debugger for a project), I don't know which IDE is recommended, I honestly don't stick with VS Code, nowadays I use vim or zed, but I know configuring them is a pain in the ass if I don't have that much time and I never configured syntax highlight, tooltips or debugging tools on any of them, once I had to use intellIJ and I got overstimulated with the amount of buttons on screen and I don't even understand their purpose.

I would love to understand what are the various debugging tools (not python exactly, like in general, for example the concept of ""breakpoint"" is language agnostic), are there debugging tools in the form of CLI? can I configure any of them on VIM?

Right now, I am learning Java, and it seems like every 10 seconds I encounter some special rule or exception when trying to perform a particular task. This particular block requires a try and catch. import more stuff. Here is a method from deep within a library I have never heard of to solve a seemingly simple problem.

I try to make a simple program that has three text boxes for inputing information about sleep, mood, and comments about the day. Try JFrame. Am told it needs a layout manager, and there are like 7 that all seem to do the same thing but are apparently really different. Only certain methods work with certain layout managers. There just seems to be *so much random and specific crap to learn*. And honestly, I'm fine learning all the random stuff to get a true understanding. But how am I supposed to even learn about this stuff? The only helpful resource for me has been Chat, but I don't want to rely on Chat.

  
I understand the concept of object oriented programming. I understand classes and methods and loops and decision structures and things like that. The very basics. But it seems even with this the path for progressing and learning is so foggy and obscured as to be impossible to find. I look at a program with 8+ import statements, and I think, ""How would I have found any of those libraries without Chat?""

I am really confused over how people actually learned how to program before AI or helpful IDEs. It may just be true, but I find it hard to believe that people just sat and read Java documentation all day before doing anything. Even when I read documentation it seems like an entire class is summed up in less than a sentence and does not help at all.

In this stage of this project I'm making, I need to add support for the ECHO command.

ECHO is a command like PING that's used for testing and debugging. It accepts a single argument and returns it back as a RESP bulk string.

    $ redis-cli PING # The command I implemented in previous stages 
    PONG 
    $ redis-cli ECHO hey # The command I will implement in this stage hey

Tests

The tester will execute the program like this:

    $ ./your\_program.sh

It'll then send an ECHO command with an argument to your server:

    $ redis-cli ECHO hey 

The tester will expect to receive $3\\r\\nhey\\r\\n as a response (that's the string hey encoded as a RESP bulk string.

Currently the issue is that i can't push new projects due to the management not wanting new stuff to deal with, currently i am doing 0 and getting paid, i get paid around 22k per year w/o taxes which is pretty good where i live, but it is not good enough for my life goals.

  
I want to keep pushing projects and keep innovating, but what i found out is that i really enjoy programming and the creativity that comes with it.

But after i look at job offers i realize that almost every dev job requires a degree or a good amount of knowledge on multiple frameworks or languages, i also realize that there is so many people currently 

I only have knowledge in python and network libraries, i used a lot of linux and honestly i really like that too but didn't saw many job openings.

  
Now what i've been debating is:

Keep on the network side of things, use a bit of python for automation and maybe go devops

or

follow the backend dev side or even a linux based carreer?

What would you do in this position? What can you tell me based of your years of experience?",2024-11-11 16:31:54

I’m a student currently pursuing my BS in data analytics. All has been going well up until this most recent course of mine, which has caused something of a crisis of understanding, and I’m not sure where I would even begin in tackling this.
For context, I do not have a background in CS, this journey of learning to program and getting into tech really only kicked off a couple of years ago, while in the midst of an existential crisis. I realized I am good at math, and enjoy abstract problem-solving and logical reasoning, so I started toying around with freecodecamp, codecademy, etc. and realized I really loved learning about all this stuff..
Since then, I re-enrolled in school, and chose data analytics. 
To this point in the course of my studies, my course material has consisted mainly of syntactical/broad concepts (primarily for Python and SQL). By this I mean stuff like “here is how you define a function in Python” or “here are the different data types you will encounter.” High-level stuff. I’m trying to put together the final project for this course and I feel like I still know absolutely nothing. I want to learn, but it’s overwhelming because feel like every question I have leads me to an infinitely deep rabbit hole of information (only about 20% of which I actually understand to begin with) and ultimately just leaves me with more questions than answers…

Is there any recommendations you guys have for someone hitting a wall in terms of “putting things together”? What should I be focusing on understanding if that is where I’m having trouble?

learnprogramming,1goqvwt,"Am I using ""Hexagonal Architecture""",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1goqvwt/am_i_using_hexagonal_architecture/,0,"I have learned about a software architecture called ""Hexagonal Architecture,"" which can serve as an alternative to the traditional 3-layer architecture. In Hexagonal Architecture, the application is decoupled from external actors or environments, and it interacts with external systems through ""ports."" These ports act as gateways for receiving input from external systems or providing outputs from the application's business logic. The ports are compatible with various types of systems, such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, MySQL, or even file systems. Specific systems can connect to these ports via ""adapters,"" enabling external systems to interface seamlessly with the application.

  
And I'm not sure whether it is different from 3-layer architecture. I programmed a web application as 3-layer architecture, and a part of code I wrote is similar to the following code:

    @Service
    public class MemberServiceImpl implements MemberService {
    
        @Autowired
        private FileUploader fileUploader;
    
        @Autowired
        private MemberRepository memberRepository;
    
        @Override
        public Long createMember(MemberCreationRequestDto dto) {
            Member member = dto.toEntity();
    
            this.fileUploader.upload(dto.getProfileImageFilename(), dto.getProfileImageAsBinary());
    
            Member savedMember = this.memberRepository.save(member);
            return savedMember.getMemberId(); // Returns auto-generated entity id
        }
    }
    
    public interface FileUploader {
    
        void upload(String filename, byte[] binaryData);
    }
    
    @Component
    @Profile(""local-dev"")
    public class LocalFileUploader implements FileUploader {
    
        @Override
        public void upload(String filename, byte[] binaryData) {
            // Upload onto local PC with FileOutputStream
        }
    }
    
    @Component
    @Profile(""deploy"")
    public class AwsS3FileUploader implements FileUploader {
    
        @Override
        public void upload(String filename, byte[] binaryData) {
            // Upload onto AWS S3 bucket
        }
    }

  
In terms of hexagonal architecture, the `FileUploader`  is the port, and `LocalFileUploader` and `AwsS3FileUploader` are the adapter. I initially thought I was coding in a 3-layer architecture, but it seems this approach also follows hexagonal architecture principles. Am I understanding this correctly?

But how do you extrapolate your learning to a more broad knowledge where you generally want to learn the overall stuff you need to know to develop practically anything?   
  
What are the points that are agnostic to a particular language/framework that is necessary so the workflow of ""having an idea, searching for the right tool, and developing"" it makes sense? I can imagine stuff like DSA is one, besides being more imperative, and maybe design patterns if we mention it outside of the OOP scope, for other languages too.  
  
But in general, for any project you need systems that interact with each other, doesn't matter if it's web based, locally, cloud, I guess?

I can prompt chatgpt the same question and the TLDR will be that I'm missing APIs, scalability, error handling, devtools, scrum, so an AI wasn't able to answer the solution, as I've seen multiple questions about ""stack, language, roadmap"" etc, but I'm trying to think outside of that, I already know OOP, FP, procedural, the thing is when stuff start getting disconnected, networking concepts like HTTP seems pretty straightforward, however getting into the TCP/IP stuff right now doesn't seem smart, given that I don't even know how to do a simple project from a more high-level concept. Besides knowing about DDLs and some basics about database, in the end is how do you even start to integrate everything.

There are tons of tutorials and ""getting started"" from different documentations, but there are stuff outside of the scope that don't have anything to do with a specific framework, lib, module, language, service, api... etc.

neither has anything to do with real ""software development lifecycle"" or anything like that, it's more like how do you know what you need for your idea to work, how do you know how do you connect two services youself? do you always need to rely on other people doing that connection in some sort of tiny module, handler or interface?",2024-11-11 17:01:25

Here are the two courses:

1. Big Data Systems and Intelligence Analytics

* Focuses on building data pipelines (ETL/ELT), cloud-based storage solutions (AWS Redshift, DynamoDB, S3), real-time processing (Kafka, Kinesis), and machine learning pipelines using AWS SageMaker.
* Includes topics like serverless architectures, MLOps principles, and data governance.
* Seems to cover a lot of cloud infrastructure and real-time data processing.

2. Big Data & NoSQL

* Focuses on NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, and HBase.
* Covers distributed systems, MapReduce programming, and big data analytics with tools like Apache Pig and Hive.
* Seems more focused on database management and large-scale data processing.

Let say we have a NxN matrix where each cell contain a number of coin set by the user. The user also set the number of operation, M.

For now let assume the user set N = 5, M = 2 and input every cell with certain amount of coins like below

|5|10|5|4|2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3|3|2|0|
|1|3|0|3|1|
|7|10|1|3|4|
|8|8|2|4|5|

Now the user need to think of a strategy. We need to collect coins from any rectangular area set by the user, specified by two coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) where (x1, y1) is the top-left corner and (x2, y2) is the bottom-right corner. Collection operation is represented as Collect(x1,y1,x2,y2,K), meaning the starship collects K coins from each cell.

Let say we do Collect(4,1, 5, 2, 7), we would collect 28 coins. It is also important to make sure we don't collect more than what the cell contain.

I think there would not be any perfect solution so I want to ask for your guys opinion. As for now I thinking of traversing every cell, find the maximum and collect half of the coin and repeat based on how many M the user set.

I also think of partitioning the matrix in submatrix like 2x2 or 3x3 but i don't know how much should i collect.

Notes:  
The limit for N is 100   
0 <= coins <= 500  
1 <= M <= 100",2024-11-11 15:33:11

I’m working on a project where I need to store and search through a database of quizzes. One of the main goals is to create a smart search feature that can return results based on meaning, even if the user’s query isn’t an exact match.

Here’s a example of the quiz titles in my database:

* Urinary Incontinence (Based on Guidelines) - 2020  
* Urinary Incontinence
* Urinary Incontinence. Chronic (Based on Approved Clinical Guidelines) - 2024  
* Gastritis and Duodenitis. Adults (Based on Clinical Guidelines) - 2024  
* Kaposi's Sarcoma (Based on Approved Clinical Guidelines) - 2024  
* Kaposi's Skin Sarcoma

...

As you can see, there are quizzes with similar titles that differ slightly in wording, year, or semantically less important details.

I need a db solution that:  

1. Makes search queries more efficient by considering semantic relevance.
2. Allows flexibility to add additional rules, such as prioritizing quizzes with similar titles based on the most recent year.",2024-11-11 11:38:53

So the list look like File 1: Names - Rocky Road\[0\], File2: color - brown\[0\], File3: availability - Common \[0\], and File4: Review - Good \[0\]. (IDK if that wasn't already clear)

I want to create a code that can tell me an  Icecream's name, color, availability, and review but only for what I ask. So I would ask for ""green"" icecreams and so it would print out the amount of green icecreams, the names, availability, and review. Any type of advice would be appreciated Thank you.

I've tried scanner methods and get methods but don't know how to implement them to a condition to get a specific element from a list. So far I've had to manually insert information I want to print via method.add(String) with a scanner class. And I'm looking more for a data collect then sort program.

I am writing a data pipeline in python. The config file is used to store which endpoints I want to stream and store. I need it at the beginning for initializing, and then at the very last function call. 

Do I really have to pass it through dozens of functions that don't need it just so the very last one has access? And more generally, is there a better way than DI? I have to now go and trace the functions and add all those keyword args.

I can do global var but that's considered bad practice. ",2024-11-11 04:22:11
learnprogramming,1go38bz,Doubts about my first experience,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1go38bz/doubts_about_my_first_experience/,5,"Hello everyone, junior developer here. I work remotely, and this is my first job, with less than six months of experience. My stack is front-end. I didn’t go to university; I’m self-taught. When I imagined my first job, I thought that after a short initial training, I’d work on projects alongside a senior developer.

Instead, I found out there are no seniors in the company. Every day, I end up relying on AI for help with my tasks. It’s discouraging and making me lose my passion for the work. Everyone else is junior too, but they have a sibling, friend, or someone to guide them—I have no one. We never do pair programming, and I had to learn the codebase on my own. They say I can ask for help if needed, but honestly, I’d need help with almost everything. The code has no comments, no documentation, and adding comments isn’t encouraged.

Is it like this for you too? My other colleagues seem to be fine with it.

Another thing I’d like to ask: Is it normal that I’m working on two projects with less than six months of experience? And, in remote work, is it typical to have to answer sudden messages, calls, or other interruptions all day? I end up with maybe 3-4 hours to actually write code and learn technologies. Everything’s starting to feel miserable.

Note: Initially how my bot was working was that it was added in the group. It was essential to have transcription turned on because the bot would then use that. Once the meeting ends and transcription is generated, someone would tag the bot and then it will generate summary and action items using that transcript and email it to the participants of the meeting.

For our this new approach the bot will join a call using meeting id and password and then once someone let the bot in the meeting, it will transcribe the meeting and then do what it was doing earlier.",2024-11-10 20:33:33

It’s not a job that really suits my original degree, and I feel like I don’t want to keep doing this for many more years; definitely not until retirement.

Programming, and especially back end development started to interest me, so I picked up Python one year ago.
Due to time constraints, I dropped it twice and now again I start to become interested again and want to give it my all.

However, as I won’t be getting an official CS degree, which programming language should I study to have some chance of landing a job in this sector in the next couple of years?

I understood now that Java or C# might be better for back end development than Python, but Python is currently the only language I know on a very basic level.

Any tips or advise?

learnprogramming,1gniff4,AI Tools Ruining the Learning Process,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gniff4/ai_tools_ruining_the_learning_process/,26,"Hey there, I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student and has now done significant coding and learning during these past 2 years. Everything was going fine. I got coding assignments and semester projects, I struggled, I coded stuff and I submitted. Most of the times, things went as expected. Other times, not as much. In the end, I got to learn new things.

Well, that was until recently. We started getting to work with Web Technologies and considering the ease of access and other obvious reasons, seeking help from AI Tools was allowed for lab tasks. I took the phrase 'seeking help' differently from my fellows. Or rather they did. While I tried learning and figuring out the generated snippets, my fellows were already done with all the tasks. Basically copying and pasting the tasks done by the tool rather than coding it themselves. This early completion set the bars higher for what can be called average. This gradually influenced my thoughts about using AI and caused conflict internally within me. Yes, AI boosts efficiency but we are not coding for a company making value for them. We are here to learn and copying and pasting snippet ain't helping with that. But, since we are graded based on what we submit, it was only natural to switch to what everyone was doing. I got into this bad habit of just getting things done by AI tools.

The realisation hit me when during a lab examination, no AI Tools and not even a smart code editor was allowed. Just that good'old Ubuntu text editor for a Programming Course. The recklessness of relying on AI made me pay the price. I could not do great there. It almost felt like I was left handicapped. Worst feeling I've ever had.

I made a mistake. Or is using AI like this normal? I'm so confused. When I talk about this to my fellows, they laugh it off telling me everyone does it. The skills I have are indeed fading due to the low amount of code written and thought about. 

The amount of thinking, writing and testing code what I used to write went down drastically over the last few months. I could've learnt a lot. I have the concepts. But the reliance on AI is setting me at a rather risky spot, making me seriously concerned. 

I tried re-doing tasks at home but considering the university's tough schedule, it got difficult to continue. 

How do I genuinely balance this out. Can someone relate to this scenario? 

I appreciate any help. Sorry to make it too long. Just wanted to address an issue that I thought many other people can probably relate to. Thanks..",2024-11-09 19:55:30

* Pro C# 10 with .NET 6: Foundational Principles and Practices in Programming
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
* The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

I am working on a small web game using the HTML5 canvas API to render things on the screen. My current goal is to make it so that multiple people can join a room and see each other. I have a decent familiarity with sockets, so I don't think this is the hard part.

My question is, how do big games handle having a lot of players and lots of data? And how would I do something similar (but on a smaller scale) in my web game? Let's say the user logs in; does he request his user info through REST? What if he wants to do some action (buy an item, kill an enemy, get XP, ...)? Will he use REST? That seems weird to me. You can use sockets to handle stuff like the player position, etc. But you do need to validate the data somehow, right? How would I check that the user doesn't have a position that would be inside some object? Sure, I can do AABB collision handling on the client, but what if someone finds a way to cheat it?

What about things like game data? Quests, enemies, objects, items, ...? Is it stored in some relational DB, and then I would request that data via REST?

Is REST suitable for this? I want to have a secure connection to a server, send and receive data, and use sockets. However, I cannot grasp how many REST requests there would be, given how many actions the user could do. Can I somehow hide the requests?

Any tips would be appreciated.",2024-11-09 13:02:58

When I raised my concern, I was told that these are _industry standards_ which I was unaware of. Can you all confirm if these practices are indeed industry standards or were my concerns valid?
  
1. Coding directly on production server without any local development environment
2. Releasing code without them being reviewed by anyone else other than the developer who wrote the code
3. Doing PR reviews without checking if the changes actually fulfill client requirements
4. Having a Product Manager who gathers client requirements without having an iota of technical knowledge but not having any Project Manager
5. Creating customized software without having a service catalogue
6. Bringing in disruptive changes to development environment across all apps that are being developed without testing those changes in one app first
7. Using a custom Python ecosystem that one of the co-founders had created but not having any documentation for the same nor willing to let anyone create the said documentation

I joined this startup a while back and had to leave because of the headache these _standard industry practices_ caused me.

learnprogramming,1gnbeqr,How Does YouTube Download Work in Web Browsers?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gnbeqr/how_does_youtube_download_work_in_web_browsers/,0,"Hi everyone,

I’m curious about how YouTube’s offline video functionality works in web browsers. Here’s what I’ve observed and would love to get some technical insights from the community.

Recently, I downloaded a video from YouTube using the web version. The video is quite long—about 3 hours—and I was able to watch it offline without any issues once it was downloaded. What puzzles me is that despite the video’s large size, the browser’s cache and storage didn’t show a significant increase in size.

Web browsers typically have storage limits for offline data such as cookies, cache, and local storage, often ranging around 5 MB for these purposes. Given this limit, I’m wondering how YouTube manages to allow such large video downloads and playback in a browser. I’ve tested this across different browsers, and it works perfectly.

**Some technical points I’m interested in:**

1. **How does YouTube circumvent browser storage limits to enable large video downloads?** Is it using some form of server-side storage or special techniques?
2. **What mechanisms are in place to manage and retrieve these offline videos without significantly affecting local storage?**
3. **Are there any JavaScript or web API methods YouTube employs to handle this efficiently?**

I would really appreciate any technical explanations or insights into how this works.

**Disclaimer:** I don’t have YouTube Premium. I’ve noticed that in my current country (where YouTube is automatically set to a local version), I’m able to download videos and watch them offline without ads. This could be due to the fact that there are fewer advertisers here, and many people don’t speak English or use Latin script.

Well, I have the time and the will now, but I've realized that I don't really have a project that I could apply my learning to. Without that, I'm afraid I'll forget everything I'll have learned in a matter of weeks.

I'm a hobbyist, and things I program are small personal productivity Windows (GUI) apps, small static websites for personal amusement, and small games.

I've looked at Elm which specializes in websites, but read a warning that it's overkill for the small category (and indeed, it seems to add several steps to my usual deployment process - which usually just consists of pushing to GitHub).

Windows GUI seems to be possible, buuut... I just have a hard time convincing myself why I wouldn't go straight to C# or JavaScript (via Electron) which I already know. I mean, okay, I might make a single project in a functional language as a novelty, but it's a recipe to forget it only slightly slower than in the case without a project, when I have much more obvious alternatives available.

I might be wrong, but I don't think games are an option, considering that they usually don't like immutable state. I'd be surprised if there are great engines anyway.

So, what, if any, functional language would be an upgrade or a valuable applicable addition for my needs?",2024-11-08 21:39:24

learnprogramming,1gmqyx7,"How to Structure a Flexible ""Condition"" Setup for a Simulation with Multiple Input/Output Parameters?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gmqyx7/how_to_structure_a_flexible_condition_setup_for_a/,5,"I’m working on a simulation software that involves a somewhat tricky user input setup, and I could use some advice on structuring it in a way that’s both flexible and intuitive for the user.

In my application, users can define a “Condition” — essentially a set of input parameters — which they can specify in various combinations. For example, they might input parameters A, B, and C, so the software would solve for D, E and F, or input B, E and F and solve for A, C, and D. In every Condition, there are about 50 such parameters, and any one of them might be either an input or an output depending on the setup.

Here’s where it gets complex: users also need to create multiple Conditions in batch mode. For example, they might set parameter A as a range (e.g., 0 to 20 in steps of 2), parameter B as specific values (e.g., 1, 5, 8), while the rest are single values. Given this complexity, I want to make it easy for users to control values that are common to all Conditions but also allow them to “break out” values for specific Conditions (e.g., D is 5 across all Conditions but 6 in the one where A is 8 and B is 5).

Alternatively, users might want to define these Conditions in a matrix-style table:

* A: 1, B: 5, C: 8
* A: 3, B: 4, C: 5
* A: 4, B: 3, C: 2

...with a common value of D across these Conditions, and then solve for E and F.

My question is: What’s a good way to present this Condition setup to users for both flexibility and simplicity? Should I go for:

1. Allowing single, multiple, or range values for each parameter directly in the Condition creation UI, and then:
   1. Create multiple conditions that have linked shared values;
   2. Create multiple conditions without linked shared values, and have some additional feature to batch-change a certain value across all Conditions, or something like ""copy value to all Conditions""?
   3. Do not show these multiple Conditions to the user, but only indicate that there will be a certain number of them based on the inputs? (I think this would preclude matrix-style table definition)
2. Allowing only single values for each parameter in the Condition creation UI, and then have a separate function like “Vary Parameters” that allows the user to override the initial static values of parameters with ranges/multiples?
3. Separating creation of a single Condition, and have a dedicated ""batch"" mode for creating multiple conditions where every parameter has a link to the ""parent"" Condition, except for the varied parameters?
4. Having a multi-level tree-like inheritance structure where child Conditions inherit parameters from parent Conditions, except for varied parameters?
5. Something else..?

If you were the user, what would be the best for you? I’m hoping there’s a term for this type of problem that could help me find existing solutions, as every idea I’ve had so far feels limited in some way. Any guidance, or examples of similar structures you’ve seen, would be hugely appreciated! Thanks!",2024-11-08 19:34:15

I am not enjoying the work conditions, and the pay is dismal.  I have a family I need to support and teaching here is not going to cut it. I will stay only as long as I need to.

The latest company has a customized AutoCAD. Long story short, I don't like it because it looks more like an unfinished product, beta at best - and it's used for everyday use. It looks to me like the company has paid a lot of money for its development and is now a prisoner of the 3rd party company that made this custom ACAD. The reported bugs are not being fixed and the software is very fragile (prone to crashes).

Anyway, my question is: since I learned some coding in between the jobs, if I want to learn scripting for ACAD or even make my own customized version of ACAD, which programming language would be the best? 

I've gone through dev support in their help files, but outside their own custom LISP (AutoLISP) language, the documentation isn't very helpful. I would like to use something like C++ or even C#(.Net) if I have to, but I need to focus on one thing as I don't want to stretch myself too thin. Also, I have time to get myself familiar with how this works and develop the software in my own pace, but I don't want to waste time on things that won't do me any good.

Also, I have reached out in the AutoCAD official group, but I got only 1 answer in 1 month from a person who told me they have given up on ACAD custom scripting. So, no help there. I though that this group might be more developer friendly, even if it's kind of a niche for software development. I know this won't be easy nor fast, but I just need some directions and I'll do the rest.

learnprogramming,1gmvcak,[Python] Is there an inherent difference with a ctypes string buffer that makes it a bad idea to use to store byte data?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gmvcak/python_is_there_an_inherent_difference_with_a/,3,"(as opposed to doing something similar natively in C)

Running into an issue where a function in a DLL expects an unsigned char \* as a buffer to byte data (specifically this function reads one byte from a device and stores that byte in the passed in data buffer). So I do ctypes.create\_string\_buffer(size) and pass that in as the data arg to this DLL function. This works sometimes, but I just spent some time debugging why it doesn't work at times, and it seems to be because when the data being read and set has a value of 0, this causes some weird behavior where this string buffer (which I know is actually a ctypes array of c\_chars, but string buffer is more concise) then treats this value as a null character, and therefore goes wacky, specifically when I try to access that byte via \`data.value\[0\]\` (this causes an index out of range error). If the byte being read and set is any other value, it seems to work fine and 0 is a valid index into this string buffer.

I don't have a full 100% grasp on what's going on here, but it \*seems\* like there's just something under the hood with how these string buffers are used. I think in C these issues don't exist because if you're using a buffer of chars to store byte data rather than characters, then you won't ever really parse the bytes as a string and therefore the value of 0 anywhere in the buffer won't cause weird issues.

But I guess in ctypes/python it's different? Just wanted to get other opinions here to see if my current understanding is correct or at least headed in the right direction.

Hi guys,

I have been developing some projects that are related to the Obstacle Routing problem. So basically my problem is as title: when should I put an algo in a class? Or when should I put an algo at some other places and pass an object to the algo when I use it. 

For example, I have two classes: Route, and Obstacle.
I need a function (algo) to determine if the route goes across the obstacle. And here is what I confuses me a bit. I don’t know if I should make this algo a method under the Route class, and then when I need to use it, I call something like Route.check_cross(Obstacle), where I pass Obstacle as an argument. Or should I just create a function that takes Route and Obstacle together? E.g., check_cross(Route, Obstacle). I am looking for maintainabilty, not the performance.

Thanks for your help. I would appreciate it.

Edit: I am currently use python here. So everything is basically public and accessible from outside the class.",2024-11-08 02:21:59

I noticed a significant shift in the way I approach building projects every few months. I think about problems in a completely different ways. I believe I'm intermediate-level.

Regarding my situation, I have couple questions:

1. Would teaching myself be sufficient for career advancement without having a degree in CS, if I plan to stay within biochemistry type of job? (Being competent in python and R is a good bonus for myself, but not an absolute necessity as we have dedicated data scientists).

1-2. What type of jobs can I pivot around if one day I become skillful at coding, but would like to to stay within biochemistry field? 

2. I do find coding very fun and exciting (well, I’m on Day 2 of learning R so I must be only looking at the surface levels). What would be the experience like taking Masters in Bioinformatics as someone who has pure science background with no prior coding experience?

My company recently got Udemy Business and I wanted to look into ML/AI courses. When searching, most seem to be about training existing  models and data science but I would like to see how they actually work under the hood more than learn to use them.

I know the high level concepts but would like to see how that is actually put into code, like simple examples of making a basic foundation model and moving up.

I'm not saying I want to make the next ChatGPT, I know thats not possible. I just want to learn how neural networks etc are actually coded and how they work. Is there anything like this you can recommend on Udemy?

I started my career as a freelancer (frontend dev, but I'm also working on some backend projects at the moment) this year after 5 years as an employee and I'm looking to make new connections for possible collaborations with different companies.  
I've been to Amsterdam at the beginning of October and I loved the city, so this might be a good opportunity to visit it again in February, during the Dev World event.  
  
I've never been to a dev conference and I always thought they usually speak more about theoretical stuffs (AI in general, soft skills, how this would change the world etc) rather than actual useful coding things. But looking at their website, I saw a lot of interesting and practical stuff, like useful tips for frontend and backend developers, dev ops and more.  
  
So I'm tempted to buy the ticket (which is quite expensive, $450) but I'd like to ask your feedback on this event first. Have you ever been there before? How likely are you to make new connections and get a job with people you meet there or at these types of events? Is it worth it the price of the ticket + travel and hotel or it's difficult to get new jobs since most of the people are developers like me?

I’m posting in this sub to seek guidance from some programmers please, particularly about resources!

Unfortunately, my software developer fiancé was made redundant due to current economy. After applying to a few, he has been given some trial coding tasks.  Each have been a language called React (apologies if I’m butchering that! I am not a snazzy programmer/have no background). His previous job focused on Azure for the main part so he’s not too familiar with this language, he’s struggled and this has naturally lead to his confidence being knocked in his ability. 

Please can I get advice on resources I can encourage him to use or books I could potentially buy to support him? Even if it’s spending you think could be minor! I just want to try and make this transition a little easier for him 

Sorry if this is too vague!  If it is I can try and ask him for more context on his coding if so!!",2024-11-08 02:29:55

I’ve sunk about 5 hours into the project so far and have my progress has nowhere in terms of any functionality. The problems I am having aren’t bug or error related, I simply do not know how to do anything.

Most of the advice on this subreddit seems to mean

”Try and do your projects completely by yourself using your own knowledge, logic and problem solving ability. Only look error messages up.”

This is why I have not looked at any tutorials for making a calculator.

Am I learning correctly by using 0 tutorials for project, if not when should I use projects and how? Is it fine as long as you understand the tutorial to rely on it heavily?

Thank you for your reply if you choose to leave one.

This length function seems to work fine (and I can post it if needed).

However, the concat function is not working as expected. When I asked ChatGPT, it told me that it has to do with my memory allocation at line 5, and that using malloc instead would work. This did indeed fix the problem but I don't understand why and I'm hoping someone here can help explain. The concat function is below:

    char *concat(char *word1, char *word2) { 

        char *new_word[255];

        int word1_length = get_length(word1);

I’m working on a project to create a sandbox that can run files in a contained environment and monitor behaviors like file modifications, network calls, and memory access. The idea is to capture these behaviors and save them in a ""blueprint"" data structure for later analysis.



Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:

1. Run files safely within a sandbox to keep the host system secure.

2. Track file, network, and memory behaviors.

3. Save the observed behaviors in a compact data structure, acting as a fingerprint for each process.



Main challenges:

\- How to ensure containment so the executable doesn’t affect the host system.

\- How to structure the blueprint data in a way that’s both detailed and efficient.

\- Choosing between Go or C++ for a low-level, efficient approach.

Suddenly, when I try to push to GitHub, I get the message

>Failed to authenticate to git remote: …

In Visual Studio Code GitHub log, I get

>remote: Invalid username or password. fatal: Authentication failed for  \[repositoy URL\]

but I am never asked for a password.

How can I diagnose/solve this?

 

# Context

I have 3 software that may potentially push to a given GitHub ""company""\*  repository

·        Visual Studio

·        Visual Studio Code

·        GitHub Desktop

All of them used to be able to push.

*\* I put quote to ""company"" because it’s a tiny non-IT company where there are no IT admin services to contact and currently no other developer. It’s just that technically a repository is not hosted on my account.*

**.gitconfig**  in %userprofile%  contains

    [filter ""lfs""]
      process = git-lfs filter-process
      required = true
      clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
      smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    [user]
      name = [my username]
      email = [my e-mail address]

 User is correct. I’m not too sure why I have `lfs` configuration there.

 **Token**

At some point, I configured a developer token (Personnal Access Token > Tokens (classic)). I think I remember that I had to write it in a config file, but I cannot find where that was anymore. (I would have expected `.gitconfig`  but it isn’t there.

This token expired so I renewed it. I believe this is when the problem started, but I had no commit to push for a while.

Recently, I deleted the token.

So maybe that token it still there in a file that I can’t find, or I forget some GitHub setting related to token ???

**Past issue**

I don’t think that it still has any impact but I mention it in case it does. I once had to connect another GitHub account (unrelated to that repository) in Visual Studio. Following this all my commits to the company repository were being pushed to the right repository but ""signed"" by that other unrelated account. I fixed this in the `.gitconfig`  file in %userprofile% . But since `.gitconfig` now contains the right account and I made commits in between, I guess this one is not an issue anymore.

**Tried**

I tried logging out  my GitHub account from GitHub Desktop, I was redirected to GitHub 2FA authentication page and authentication was validated. After this, GitHub Desktop was back to its initial state... Account logged in in GitHub Desktop but can't push to repository.  
I currently don't know of a way to log out from GitHub in Visual Code and Visual Studio.

# SOLUTION FOUND

I found the solution. It was not in some central GitHub config file, it was actually in my workspace/project.  
In file:

>.\\.git\\config

I had line

`url = https://[account name]:[token]@github.com/[company]/[repositoy].git`

By simply removing account name and token from this URL in the file, so:

`url =` [`https://github.com/[company]/[repositoy].git`](https://github.com/[company]/[repositoy].git)

The next time I tried to push in VS Code, it required me to login. Where I had a choice between various authentication methods (browser, code, authenticator, token, etc...)",2024-11-07 13:12:16

After a few years on the forum, I finally feel motivated to ask a question.

Driven largely by personal passion, at the age of 31, and after 10 years in the healthcare sector, I have decided to pivot into the tech industry. I just work as a Pharmacy Officer just in case someone ask. 

I am currently enrolled in a regulated training course in Spain focused on web application development. However, the course content isn't very extensive and seems to cover only the minimum requirements (the course gives access to the university).

After researching the job market in Spain, it seems that Java combined with the Spring Boot framework is a good path to follow.

Based on reading hundreds of comments on previous questions, I have chosen a path to follow in parallel with the course:

1.- The Java MOOC from the University of Helsinki.
2.- Learning basic SQL. 
3.- Learning Spring Boot through Javabrains.
4.- Creating a GitHub profile and a LinkedIn profile. 
5.- Working on personal projects.
6.- My english is already ""ok"" but I will try to earn a certificate.

I am unsure if platforms like LeetCode or Codewars are worth it for practice during the learning process and which personal projects are typically interesting to have as a beginner.

Im open to any tip that can improve my path.

Im open to move to another country, but I guess the first few years will be easier for me to start in Spain.

Thank you very much to anyone who takes the time to read and try to help me out.

For example:

You run a school where the last day of school impacts various schedules - like the year end trip, as well as the end of year award ceremony. Both logics are completely separate, but both write to the calendar collection at the end. Ideally you would write once in bulk.

1. We want to schedule the end of year award ceremony on the last Thursday of the year.
2. We want to schedule a trip 5 weekdays before the last day of the school year.

There will be other scenarios, based off of other dates. 

Given that dates can be updated during the year (not just pre-calculated at the beginning), how would you structure this application - specifically how would you organize this logic? ",2024-11-07 12:38:52

I know it’s not the simplest version but it’s the one I wrote without help. Now I’m trying rewrite my program using try and except so that it handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message exiting the program.

    x = input(‘Enter Hours:’)
    y = input(‘Enter Rate:’)
    xy = float(x)*float(y)
    text = ‘Pay:’
    xr = ((float(x)-40)

    ot = float(xrt+xy)
    if(float(x))<=40:
        print(text,day)
    elif(float(x))>40:
        print(text,it)
    

This is what I got so far on the try and except:

    x = input(‘Enter Hours:’)
    y = input(‘Enter Rate:’)
    xy = float(x)*float(y)
    text = ‘Pay:’

Now this works fine BUT if the user enters an invalid answer when it says Enter Hours: say they put “forty” it still prompts the next input Enter Rate: and only after that does it print Error, please enter numeric input BUT what I want it to do is stop and print Error, please enter numeric input as soon as they enter “forty” or something invalid (something that is not a number) how would I go about this????

learnprogramming,1glm1tj,Struggling My AI-Powered Personal Desktop Assistant Project – Any Tips?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1glm1tj/struggling_my_aipowered_personal_desktop/,3,"Hello everyone,

It's a long post but I believe context matters.

As I mentioned in the title, I’m currently working on building an AI-powered assistant capable of performing a range of tasks, such as sending/reading emails, accessing the calendar and adding events, creating files and folders, accessing GitHub, retrieving news, etc. I'm using Ollama to download models so it can operate primarily offline.

My approach has been to give the AI a template with some conventions on how its answers should be structured and how to accomplish tasks. The model’s response is formatted in JSON with two main keys: `""message""` and `""tasks""`. The `""message""` key contains the AI’s regular response, while `""tasks""` includes the specific tasks I’ve asked it to perform, formatted according to certain conventions. My code then takes the value of the `""tasks""` key, parses it, and executes the corresponding functions for each task. I made it like this so that the AI doesn't mix the task conventions with the actual response. Also, I gave it limited access to many stuff so that it doesn't delete my Windows files, for example, by mistake. I know this approach might seem naive or overly complex, but it’s what I’ve been able to implement so far. I'm still in my sophomore year as a CS student.

Currently, my main struggle is that this approach doesn’t allow the AI to see the result of each task. For example, if I ask it to list the last 10 emails in my Gmail, it will respond, “Sure, here are the 10 emails:” but doesn’t actually have access to these emails. I have to append the function’s result to the response manually.

I’d like the AI to handle chained tasks in one prompt (e.g., fetch my contacts, store them in a file, search for a specific contact in that file, and then send an email to that contact). My approach for this is to use a `""current_task""` key and a `""task_queue""` key. After each task, I would take the result and re-prompt the AI with the remaining tasks in the queue, so it can use the result as a parameter in subsequent tasks.

In theory, this should work, but in practice, the AI often hallucinates additional tasks, confuses itself about task contents, or gets stuck in an infinite loop, repeating tasks I didn’t request.

I wanted to see what people think of this approach and how can I improve it or solve the problem of chained tasks. Any new perspective or suggestion is appreciated.",2024-11-07 08:43:17

A see a lot of people complain about what we call ""tutorial hell"" where people follow tutorial after tutorial but never actually learn anything.

Often the responses to these kind of posts is just to create things with what you learnt from the tutorial, but that doesn't help much if you didn't learn anything because, well... you just copied code without understanding why it was written like that, or why that framework/library was used.

This is where making notes on the content you're consuming helps. It makes the process of following a tutorial much slower and it has taken me multiple hours to get through 15 minutes of a tutorial before. But describing what it is you are doing, what the function you just wrote does, what purpose of each frameworks or libraries you are using serves allows you to really understand the code you are essentially copying line for line.

Once you understand it you can modify it, you can write your own with at least an idea of what you are doing and why. If you stumbled into a problem, what did you do to fix it? Did you find the solution in a forum post? Then note down that link so you can review the explanation of that solution.

The function that is used in the game to do so is:

    updateGameInfo()

I have the HTML/CSS/JS defined, so for team member name, it would be

    const memberName = document.getElementById(""name"")

And I would like to change it after updateGameInfo() is complete to be

    memberName.textContent = window.gameInfo.party[0].name

How can I create this function to automatically run after updateGameInfo() and get the relevant information to change the variables?

Solutions that have been suggested to me:

* Use MutationObserver to Observe Changes

&#8203;

    const memberName = document.getElementById(""name"");
    
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
        memberName.textContent = window.gameInfo.party[0].name;
    });
    
    // Assume game info is stored in an element with ID ""game-info""
    const gameInfoElement = document.getElementById(""game-info"");
    
    // Start observing for any changes in child nodes or the subtree
    observer.observe(gameInfoElement, { childList: true, subtree: true });const memberName = document.getElementById(""name"");
    
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
        memberName.textContent = window.gameInfo.party[0].name;
    });
    
    // Assume game info is stored in an element with ID ""game-info""
    const gameInfoElement = document.getElementById(""game-info"");
    
    // Start observing for any changes in child nodes or the subtree
    observer.observe(gameInfoElement, { childList: true, subtree: true });

   * The main issue with this is that I am not sure how to find the window.gameInfo id.
* SetInterval()

&#8203;

    setInterval(() => {
        if (window.gameInfo && window.gameInfo.party[0]) {
            const memberName = document.getElementById(""name"");
            memberName.textContent = window.gameInfo.party[0].name;
        }
    }, 1000);setInterval(() => {
        if (window.gameInfo && window.gameInfo.party[0]) {
            const memberName = document.getElementById(""name"");
            memberName.textContent = window.gameInfo.party[0].name;
        }
    }, 1000);

   * I added this to script.js (which is referenced in index.html), but it didn't work. I tried adding it to the service-worker (background.js) and it looked like the extension was updating but the information was not being updated in the extension popup.

Thank you for any direction on this!",2024-11-06 23:32:07

Before I start, I want to thank u/Big\_Combination9890 for helping me previously with issues I had programming the length of the Snake to increase whenever it ate a fruit. I managed to fix it by using rectangles for the Snake's body instead of a list of tuples, but your help couldn't have gotten me to that point.

Additionally, I want to note I started learning Python around 8 weeks ago as a complete noob in coding and I only started using Pygame since like 4 weeks ago, so if anything looks unusual or inefficient in my code, it could be due to both, but any useful tips are welcome.

As for my problem now, I'm trying to program that the Snake dies (the game ends) when the head of the Snake touches it's own tail/body, however, each time I run the game, the head instantly collides with the body of the Snake and it's Game Over before you can even play. I've tried numerous ways to fix this, but I can't seem to come to a fix that works. Here is my current code:

    import pygame
    import random
    pygame.init()
     
    screen_width = 800
    screen_length = 600
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_length))

    direction = ""right""
    direction_x = 1 # 1 = right, -1 = left
    direction_y = 0 # 1 = up, -1 = left
    snake = [pygame.Rect((x * 20, 0, 20, 20)) for x in range(3)]
    
    # Function to create randomized position
    def random_fruit_position():
        fruit_x = random.randint(0, (screen_width - 15))
        fruit_y = random.randint(0, (screen_length - 15))
        return pygame.Rect(fruit_x, fruit_y, 15, 15)
    
    # Create fruit variable
    fruit = random_fruit_position()
    
    clock = pygame.time.Clock() # Controls the speed of the game (by limiting the amount of game loops per second)
    
    run = True
    while run:
        screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    
        # Draw fruit
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), fruit)
    
        # Draw Snake
        for segment in snake:
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, (127, 0, 255), segment)

                    direction = ""right""
                if (event.key == pygame.K_w or event.key == pygame.K_UP) and direction != ""down"":
                    direction_x = 0

The part of my code where I tried coding the detection of the snake's head with it's body is this part:

        for segment in snake[2:]:
            if head.colliderect(segment):
                print(""Game over!"")

I want to grab an internship this summer. I started practicing leetcode for a while now. I have an issue with doing leetcode. I don't exactly know what the problem issue. I don't where I'm doing it wron. But let me tell me some scenarios. 

I'm good with the CONCEPTS. I know what a hashmap is. I know what a String is. 

How am I supposed to remember all the methods associated with a particular library? Even though if I some how managed to remember the function names there is going to syntactical errors. 

Some people said I am not allowed to Google things in coding rounds. Does that mean I'm not allowed to refer to the documentation. 


If no, can I refer to the documentation in any coding round that I attend?

I get the approach. An approach with less time complexity O( ). But I feel like I'm stuck when writing code because I don't know the method name. 

Earlier today I have a solved a code chef problem.

Problem statement: convert an integer number into binary and flip the most significant and least significant number and return the integer value. 

I managed to flip the LSB using the XOR operator ( ^ ). But then I got stuck with flipping the MSB. I had an instinct that there must've been a method to help me extract the MSB. I knew there must've been one. But I don't know what. And then I thought of converting it into string and manipulating the first and last chat but that just didn't seem efficient. 

So I have up and looked for the solution. Turns out there is a method named 'highestOneBit' associated with the 'Integer' class. 

How am I supposed to know THAT?

Some people say that I would remember method names after solving enough problems. But methods like these aren't something that I'm gonna use on a daily basis right.

I have a set of data (call it ""Data"") that is processed by an external system. In that system, Data behaves as a constant and is immutable. However, in the source application the Data remains mutable. 

This results in a possible outcome where Data in the external system does not match Data in the source system.

  
From here, I see three options.

1. Create a new instance of Data in the external system and process the whole thing as a new instance.

2. Try to build logic that does roll-backs and updates in the external system to correct the data.

3. Set Data as immutable in the source system while the external system's process is ""in progress"".

  
Option 1 sounds straightforward, but I worry about the external system and its data integrity from just abandoning the original instance.

Option 2 sounds convenient but really complicated to expand/maintain.  

Option 3 sounds like the best approach in general. However, I worry about the UX and I still have the issue of the records being present from the original instance of Data. 

  
If I have to pick an option, I guess I'll take number 3. I just don't feel super confident about any approach and wanted to see if there were some standards or recommendations for dealing with this type of issue.",2024-11-06 17:29:45

A little bit of context: I am a Full Stack Developer with 6 years of experience. I was recently given a trainee to mentor, and I am struggling to understand whether copilot and generative AI will potentially hinder his professional development.

When they share their screen during debugging or me helping them go through the problem, I noticed that a lot of their process involves writing function names and then waiting for copilot suggestions or straight up using ChatGPT.

I feel like trying to do something and failing is an important step in learning, well, anything.

Is this something I should ask him to avoid for some time? Or am I the modern equivalent of the dude saying ""IDEs and autocomplete will make you lazy""? Is this out of my responsibilities as a mentor?

I would really like to hear from someone who trained junior/trainee developers in the era of GenAI.

Note: I use Copilot and ChatGPT myself for small problems (as they are sometimes unreliable) and usually turn Copilot off when I need to think deeply about a problem. I am not against it; I just feel it will have a negative effect on his abilities in the future.

I'm writing this message because I need some advice.

I'll give a brief overview of my background to help you understand my journey.

I'm 41 years old with 16 years of experience in IT support, specializing in networks.

I worked for three years with France's second-largest internet service provider, handling advanced network troubleshooting for large accounts, primarily French multinationals.

Then, I moved to follow my partner at the time, left that job, and found a temporary position as an IT support technician at a university.

My supervisors encouraged me to take the civil service exam to become a permanent employee.

There were three positions available, with 400 applicants. I finished first by studying alone on weekends for several months before passing the three exams required for my permanent position (I’m not trying to brag, just to give you an idea of my ability to work independently).

I've been in this role since 2012, providing Level 2 and 3 network support across the entire campus and remote sites.

I've grown somewhat tired of this job, and despite the various responsibilities I’ve been given, I'm starting to feel worn out.

I also manage a few Linux servers used for relatively simple tasks like DHCP, NTP, etc.

I want to change careers for several reasons:

1. I'd like to work fully remote to join my new partner, who was transferred abroad.
2. I’d like to increase my salary.
3. I want to learn programming because it's always interested me, though I've never really invested time into it as I felt a bit lost.

Lately, I've been exploring what I could do with my skills and what interests me, and I've seen that DevOps might suit me well.

I don’t have the time or money to go back to school, but I do have a strong capacity for self-learning.

Which language should I learn?  
Is it realistic to change careers by learning on my own?

I would really like a quick transition to a field I’d enjoy. I've always loved networks and servers, but I'm also very interested in application development.

What would you advise?

Thank you in advance for your help.",2024-11-06 14:08:00

What I want the program to do:

* Update when updateGameInfo() is complete. \*PS updateGameInfo() is run whenever the window object changes so I want to update it according to this, rather than on a set timer.
* Team Information Updates

I have encountered non-compilation before, where sometimes i'll have to put forward declarations and sometimes I can't avoid it without some sort of hacky workaround. 

Of course, I would rather not go through 20 files and forward declare everything.

learnprogramming,1gjljl4,Is The Odin Project still relevant in 2025?,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gjljl4/is_the_odin_project_still_relevant_in_2025/,102,"I am asking this question as a `machine learning engineer` with over four years of experience. I've been studying TOP for a few weeks now, and it's an excellent tool for thoroughly learning the fundamentals of web development principles, along with essential hard skills like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React`, and more. In my view, it's the best course available for anyone pursuing a full-stack web development path.

...BUT

Two major concerns that have been lingering in the back of my mind have finally surfaced, affecting my motivation:

* First, the ""too rapid"" advancements in AI technology- both in academia and industry- make me wonder if, by the time I become proficient in full-stack web development, perhaps a year from now, AI will make me obsolete already. I don’t want to invest significant time in a field that may be dead in a few years. I see this as a strong possibility because, as someone directly involved in building these AI solutions, I know firsthand that they are designed to handle increasingly complex tasks.
* Second, according to the [2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile/#developer-roles), there are already thousands of experienced full-stack developers in the market, and their median salary is not particularly high. I’m not looking to transition into another conventional white-collar position in web development; instead, I hope to use these skills to build a minimum viable product and pursue my solopreneur aspirations.

With these thoughts in mind, I have two questions:

1. Given the current landscape -where tons of AI-generated code are already lingering on the internet- do you think investing in web development skills will be worthwhile in the coming years? **`(edit: Folks, I am already a developer. My question is not ""Should I start coding despite AI?"". I am looking for answers to something like this: ""Is studying X, Y and Z to code a full-fledged website by using frameworks A, B and C logical, or will AI take care of A, B, C or even X, Y, Z in a couple of years?"")`**
2. Would it be wiser to focus on technologies like Webflow for building websites `(instead of X, Y and Z)`? Webflow seems intent on adapting to the ""AI era"" and could offer tools that simplify the development process. The learning curve is also less steep compared to TOP.

learnprogramming,1gk9ug8,Resources for learning discrete math+ dsa/self learning CS curriculum while in school?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gk9ug8/resources_for_learning_discrete_math_dsaself/,2,"Right now I am in school but am often left self studying due to work, mandatory classes, or simply being told the subject matter cannot be explained any simpler /the questions I ask cannot be understood. I recognize this is vague but it is hard to stay within academic integrity guidelines on the internet. 
Right now I have been getting 50/100 on my discrete math and intro to dsa1 midterms, and often struggle through homework. The one sentiment I try to cite is 'inconsistency', that it is very hard to study a single example problem and have any idea how to apply the concepts to the other, compared to high school where the focus was on brute repetition with the comfort that the questions on homework and exams would be the exact same format except tweaking numbers and names of hypothetical people in word problems. 
I recognize to have this issue in multiple classes means the problem is me, but I don't have an infinite amount of time to develop intuition through studying example problems and abstract concepts, especially when  self studying+ emailing teachers+ TA's remotely. 

To be more specific, I'd say things officially stopped at least feeling memorizable after propositional logic and we were introduced to intro to proofs, proving math theorems(even numbers, odd numbers, rational numbers), sets, cardinality, algorithms,
 Etc. 
We also don't have practice exams. For classes such as intro to algorithms this is a bit more stressful as I can only repeatedly expose myself to problems and scrounge on the internet. 


There are often many resources on self learning CS curriculums but i am not sure if they assume the student has their own deadline.

learnprogramming,1gk0smw,Learn C or Python first?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gk0smw/learn_c_or_python_first/,39,"Hi All,

Bit of background first:

I'm 4 weeks into an intensive 9-month bootcamp. It's mostly self-taught with a new topic every week. Students are required to read some resources, then do some self-learning and complete coding tasks (roughly 30 coding tasks a week so far) and then run them through a checker to pass the task. It's supposed to be fulltime study, however I need to work fulltime and can only dedicate after work hours and weekends to study.   
  
The first 3ish months are all in C and I can already see that I'm doing the tasks and not really understanding what I am doing. After C, we learn Python, SQL, Javascript and a few more topics. I have spoken with quite a few past students who have given feedback that the course is intense, it's hard to study and do fulltime work and some have said its best if you have some coding experience before doing the bootcamp. Most students are in class working through the tasks together, while I am mostly doing it by myself. 

Lastly, the reason for doing the course is because the school have good networking opportunities and really help with trying to get a job when you finish. At this stage I am unsure if I want to do data analytics or software engineering. 

My questions are:

1. If I am struggling to learn C, should I push through the course and hope I understand things better when learning Python?

2. Should I stop the course, take a few months to go learn C at my own pace with some free courses and then reenroll in the bootcamp early next year with a better understanding?

3. Like point 2, but should I go learn Python first to help me understand the concepts better and then maybe do some C, before reenrolling in the bootcamp?

How can I improve myself towards having a job?

Hi everyone. I’m an aspiring 26 years old software developer from Turkey. I originally graduated as a mechanical engineer but during my last semester, I interned at a technology company. Not as a software intern, however. It would take an unnecessary amount of detail for the purposes of this post to explain the job in detail but I can explain it like a project manager with a high level technical knowledge in all the areas the company operate in. This includes web and mobile development, cyber sevurity (specifically e-mail security and penetration testing), data science, big data etc. I have not written a single code here as part of my job, these were all R&D projects and due to my role, I only needed to know the high level details of each technology, enough to have a conversation with the technical teams to draft solid project ideas.

However, lately I have been increasingly dissatisfied with such a non-technical job. I wanted to actually do something, not just discuss it and leave it to others. I started the Odin Project’s full stack javascript course and recently finished the React section. Web development is a current interest of mine but I don’t want to constrain myself since I’m very early into the sector and I can go to other directions as well.

My concern is that although my experience at my current job is a plus, since I don’t have any actual software development experience, it will be very hard for me to apply for a job other than an intern (and I’m married so I can’t afford being a low paid intern 😄). I can finish the Odin Project, or some other course that grants a certificate at the end but I don’t think these will be enough. My question is to the experienced devs out there, whether they be a team lead or not. What kind of qualifications is expected from a junior web developer at the moment? What kinds of activities can I pursue that will both imrpove me as a developer and help me career-wise. I’m open to any suggestions as I’m beginning to be very depressed at a job that offers very little personal improvement and pay, and time is working against me as I get older, I cannot guarantee things that most college students or people freshly out of college can guarantee.",2024-11-05 07:45:40

I’m looking to make a career change into a tech related field, but not 100% sure which route to take. I’ve been struggling over the past couple of years to figure this out. I have no formal tech related education and most of my work experience has been with non-profits supporting people with disabilities. I’m really not in a position where I could afford to go back to college. I enjoy the work I do overall, but there’s just not much room for growth or earning potential. 

I’ve always been interested in technology and studied a bit of web development on udemy and freecodecamp. I really enjoy coding so far but I do find it a bit intimidating, I haven’t gotten much further than the very basics. I’m also just not sure how realistic it’d be for me to get a job in that field (I’m in Canada if that helps for context). 

I’ve also started studying the Google IT support course and looked into getting comptia certs, which interests me as well. I mostly want to know if one of these paths would be more realistic to break into than the other. Or would it make more sense to get enough certs for a help desk type role, and then work on coding from there. I could  see myself getting into programming if possible, it really interests me. I’m just at a bit of a loss of how to get there efficiently. 

I’m curious to hear if anyone has been in a similar situation, and been able to build enough skills/certifications to become employable. If so, how did you go about it?

However, to make it easier for clients usage, I'm about to implement the client library which will hide all the complicated communication details and provide a nice API interface to the outside.

Now I got a dilemma where to put headers containing the IPC protocol (e.g. message format, internal structs, some enums and etc.). There are basically two scenarios I see:

- Client library will also contain API header and IPC headers which will be used by the service.
- Service will own IPC headers. In this case client library will depend on headers provided by service, so I will install them and include in a client library.

So, basically the question is which approach is more correct -> should library depend on service or service on the library. Might be there are some books where I can read about this stuff?

Here is small directory tree visualization:
```
Example #1:
-lib
---- example.cpp
---- example.h
---- ipc.h
-service
---- main.cpp
---- ipc.cpp -> includes ipc.h provided by lib

Example #2:
-lib
---- example.cpp -> includes ipc.h 
---- example.h
-service

I am slowly learning on the trades and would like some guidance on the question posted to me to create a program. Any help or advise would be appreciated. As below:

  
Write a small program (in any language) that will read a file named “messages.csv” row by row and send an HTTP API request based on data read from the file.

Each row represents one SMS message and consists of four columns, two can be populated manually (in a text editor) and two must be filled by the program.

The first two columns manually filled in are SenderId and MSISDN. You can fill the MSISDN column with your phone number. Details on how to fill in the SenderId column will be explained later in this document. Once a row is read and SenderId and MSISDN are extracted, you should generate a random number and use it as the messageID in the HTTP request but also store it in the appropriate row in the file. An HTTP API request should be sent to the Infobip SMS API for each row.

After the request is sent, the response will contain two important fields: messageId and description. Match the messageId to the one stored in the file and write in the description received for each message.

Specifically, I have a user type whose only privilege is to evaluate a specific activity within the system.

I would like to know if it is possible to create a separate table for evaluator accounts that is not connected to the main accounts table. Additionally, these evaluators are categorized into different types, such as faculty, student, and parent.

Another reason I want to create a separate table for this user type is that evaluators might only need to evaluate once. So I am also thinking that do they need to have an account if they are only using the system once? But still, some evaluators, specifically studenta and faculty members might evaluate more that once.

I am accepting other suggestions to implement it correctly whether creating a separate table or other ways to save evaluator's information without creation of the accounts. Thank you, guys!",2024-11-05 08:47:34

I'm a computer science freshman with little to no experience in programming before college. Recently, I've been feeling very behind on my programming classes, and want to improve and learn more. As much as I hate to admit for my own dignity, I've only been doing the bare minimum, and that obviously isn't going to get me anywhere.

So here I am asking you all a question: how long did it take you to get used to programming? Just the gist of it all, you know? I just want to set a few 

Everything that had been assigned to us just boils down to logic, and I understand the concept. I just don't know how to execute the problems. Usually, I would just go through my textbook, copy whatever seems right to me, and most of the time the code works. However, I don't want to keep doing that. I want to code just straight from my mind, if that's even possible.

I'm pretty sure it's quite early for me to say I feel discouraged, as I'm only 2 months into college, but I really do. Everyone seems to know what they're doing, and I'm only putting up an act that I know what I'm doing. I definitely expected myself to be used to programming now, but I feel like I only increased my skills to 2% lol.

Little bit about the API. The api is designed to be easy to use without to much hustle solution the authentication for the read only endpoints is with header secret. There are an endpoints that support and token authentication but they are for create and update the recipes.

You can take a look of the docs https://mikebgrep.github.io/forkapi/ There a full description from start to deploy the API.

learnprogramming,1gk03mr,Panda Dataframe and running a classifier on it,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gk03mr/panda_dataframe_and_running_a_classifier_on_it/,1,"does anybody no how to change a python file to make it so that instead of running the dataset it loads a dataset from a CSV file? I've been trying to do it for hours now but have been going around in circles making 0 progress I know how to make the dataframe but I can't figure out how to load a CSV file with it. 

here are the instuction I had to follow

Create a panda Dataframe representing the table above.  
B. Print the weather conditions of the 8th day and indicate, separately, whether it is a good  
day to play tennis or not; print the humidity condition of the 12th day.  
C. Transform the data into a form suitable for machine learning (strings must be encoded  
into numbers)  
D. Learn a decision tree-based model on your dataset. Display the tree you learned.  
E. Use your tree to predict whether Days 5 and 9 are good days to play tennis or not.

**F. Instead of creating the Dataframe from scratch as in A, upload the csv file entitled “Play**  
**Tennis.csv” and repeat questions B-E.**

F is the part I am struggling with

also I am having trouble with a similar problem with the second part that involves  Testing classifiers on a dataset

the instruction I have for that is as follows

A.Load the breast cancer data set from scikit-learn (or sklearn) and divide the data  
randomly into a training and a testing set where the training set contains 70% of the data  
and the testing set contains 30% of the data.  
B. Train a decision tree classifier on your training data and indicate the number of errors  
made by that classifier on the testing set.  
C. If you re-run the code for A and B, do you always get the same result? Why? Make  
changes to the code to ensure that you always get the same result. Re-run the new code  
several times to ensure that you always get the same result.D. Use the “classification\_report” command to compute accuracy, precision, recall, and  
f1-measure for the experiment in 2.C  
E. Test your classifier from 2.C using 10-fold cross-validation. Print the scores obtained on  
each of the 10 folds, as well as the mean and standard deviation of these scores.  
F. Repeat your cross-validation experiment with three other classifiers: logistic regression,  
naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (with the RBF Kernel) and three metrics:  
Accuracy, F1-Measure, AUC. Make a Powerpoint slide with a table showing the results  
obtained by each classifier (please include decision trees as well) on each of the three  
metrics.

I’m in the process of building a job portal website, and I’m stuck on choosing between **Next.js** and **Angular** for the frontend framework. I’ve looked into both, but I’m still undecided on which one would be better for this type of project.

A little bit about the project:

* It’s going to have features like job listings, filters, user authentication, profile management, etc.
* I want to ensure great performance, scalability, and SEO optimization.
* I also want to create a smooth, dynamic user experience.

**My main considerations:**

* **SEO:** I know Next.js does server-side rendering out of the box, which sounds great for SEO. But is Angular capable of handling SEO well with Universal (Angular SSR)?
* **Performance:** I’ve heard that Next.js can be faster due to its static site generation features, but how does Angular compare in performance for a data-heavy app like a job portal?
* **Developer Experience:** I’m also thinking about ease of development and future maintainability. Which framework would make the development process more enjoyable in the long run?

I would really appreciate any insights from people who have worked with either framework (or both). If you have experience building similar projects, I’d love to hear what worked for you and why!

I'm not a recent grad; I'm a soon-to-be grad, but I'm very interested in pursuing the AI/ML engineering route. Honestly, I have no clue how to go about it.

I'm fine with calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, and analysis, and I'm ""decent"" at best in Python. Unfortunately, there wasn't much emphasis on Python at my university (though it's my favorite language), and I didn’t have much time to study it independently.

I'm not a complete beginner, but I’m close to one. After graduating, I'll have about six months (give or take) to work on this myself, and I hope to reach at least a junior level in the field.

Any roadmap and/or resources (preferably free or not too expensive) to get started and advance would be greatly appreciated.

Here's the question:

I am preparing to develop a guitar learning App where users can play a song they choose. The App can judge if the notes they are playing are right, and if they play in time. After playing the App will give users a score based on their performance. One problem is that the input audio can be noisy and may contain non-guitar sound (for example, your mom suddenly say ""dinner's ready"" to you when you are practicing, or there is a guy playing piano in a same room). This can trick the pitch detection algorithm into thinking the user has played a note but actually they haven't.

I searched Google for pitch detection and I found some libraries based on algorithm like YIN, but I am unable to find libraries that can identify instrument sound from other inferences.

I hope y'all may give me some guidance toward a solution. If there is one specific library that fits my need, it would be great. If there isn't, I'd appreciate any infomation I might needs (e.g. background knowledge, courses, tools etc.) that help me solve this problem.

P.S. I don't know if there is a sub-reddit that's more suitable for this problem, like sound processing per se? If you know please comment below.

learnprogramming,1gk1ik4,Help with Python Function for Player Transfer History – Handling Same-Day Transfers!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gk1ik4/help_with_python_function_for_player_transfer/,1,"Hey everyone,

I’m working on a Python function to process player transfer history, generating a ""player-club-history"" dataframe, and I'm running into issues with cases where players are transferred back and forth on the same day.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the problem:

I have transfer data that looks something like this:

|playerId|toClubId|fromClubId|startDate|isLoan|sameDayTransfers|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|322490|9521|10844|2021-03-02|false|1|
|322490|27841|9521|2022-08-31|false|1|

|322490|27841|33608|2024-07-01|false|2|
|322490|33608|27841|2024-07-01|false|2|

I need a function that returns the player’s club history in a new table format with these columns: `playerId`, `clubId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, and `isLoan`.

My main issue is with transfers on the same day. When `sameDayTransfers = 1`, there’s no problem; however, if a player moves to and from a club on the same day, it ""messes"" up the `endDate` calculation. I need to rank/chain the same-day transfers based on previous moves and ensure the function respects the direction of each transfer.

The final result should be the following:

|playerId|toClubId|fromClubId|startDate|endDate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|322490|9521|10844|2021-03-02|2022-08-30|
|322490|27841|9521|2022-08-31|2023-06-29|
|322490|33608|27841|2023-06-30|2024-06-30|

Last week I wrote a couple of small beginner programs on VS code. There were a couple of problems with compiling, something was missing, but I managed to fix it after a couple of hours of suffering. I wrote those 2 programs and they were debugging and running as the are supposed to - nothing going wrong. 

Yesterday I started writing a third one. Everything is going fine, I did not change my approach, I did not mess with VS files or anything. I try to debug the program. ""file.exe is missing"" 

Okay, no big deal, I will just google and fix this. I google for 2 fucking hours. Nothing. The only solutions I find are those that I don't understand. Most of them don't even fit my situation. Old programs are still running/debugging as they are supposed to.

""Okay. Maybe something updated or I deleted something. I will just reinstall VS. No biggie""  
Oooohhh boyyy. 6 fucking reinstallation. It didn't help. Old programs are still working. The new one refuses to debug. Now something is wrong with ""launch.json"". ""What the fuck is that"". Googling. Okay, there's something. I just need to open it and change the text. I create launch.json copy the text from the solutions. ""task.json""

Getting to this step took me 3 hours. Okay. Google. Make file. Copy text. Fuck off. ""launch.json""  
""okay"" I'm reinstalling VS for the 7th time. Maybe THIS time thing will be okay.

Reinstallation finished. Old programs running as they are supposed to. I create a new file. ""exercise.c""  
Write a simple ""Hello World!"".   
""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')"". 

Another hour spent googling. Nothing fucking works. All the solutions I find are something like ""Yes, I got the same issue, it's easy. You just need to rewrite poopinshittin.json and configure you VS paths and solve quantumphysics"". WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?  
I don't even know what a .json is. I JUST want to do my homework. I want to open an app. Write the program, debug it and be done.   
What the fuck am I doing wrong. The old programs didn't have any problems. They didn't have any json files. I created the new program in the same way, same libraries, same everything. Now old programs also don't work.

I'm losing my mind. Please. Maybe some of you can recommend another app or a link to a good guide on how to set up VS. I watched a couple. Nothing works. All my json files are created empty and the guides are from a couple of years ago, so the input from them does not even work.

learnprogramming,1gjlx4y,Programming language descission stress,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gjlx4y/programming_language_descission_stress/,10,"For the past half year I have been following The Odin Project and I have now completed all projects. While doing personal projects now I have found that I almost completely dont enjoy the projects I am making, particularly working in large frameworks like React or Nextjs. So I started thinking back on what I actually want to do.

While looking back on TOP(the odin project) I remembered that what I enjoyed learning most was a module about computer science concepts(Hash maps, linked lists, merge sort, recursion etc..). And with this I concluded that I wanted to start doing projects more oriented around learning and applying core concepts and I concluded that doing this in a web development space was not the right choice for me. 

With this realization I decided I want to start learning java and start doing projects where I could learn these topics outside of a large framework.

My issue comes with advice from father, who has been in the industry a long time and has learned programming long ago in basic, started doing assembly java and has pretty much kept up with the field as it became more modern and now works with nodejs and react. He thinks it is a waste of time for me to learn java and that if I start doing larger projects in javascript I will eventually learn these concepts as I continue.

Now I dont know what to do anymore. Does half a year of javascript programming with experience in a couple backend and frontend frameworks enough for me to have developed a programming basis good enough for me to hop to another language? Or should I continue developping skills in javascript even though I currently dont feel like Im doing anything I actually enjoy?

learnprogramming,1gk3doi,"No programming language feels ""proper"" for what I want to do",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gk3doi/no_programming_language_feels_proper_for_what_i/,14,"Basically just what the title says. I've been looking at a bunch of progamming languages for a while now: Java, Kotlin, Scala, C/C++, Rust, Go, Nim, Clojure, Python and probably others I have forgotten, but none of them seem right for the type of programming I want to do. So, what is that type of programming?

Basically, I've mostly made simple command line applications for personal use, nothing impressive by any metrics though and as such I have never ""distributed"" them in anyway, and another reason for that is that I have a self-imposed set of ""rules"" for things I make and then choose to distribute (although I by no means claim originality in it). The first of these goes: ""A thing I make should be accessible on as many platforms as is reasonably possible"", so for programming specifically it is that any given program I make should be able to run on as many platforms is within reason.

Naturally, the first language I considered for the job was Java. As far as I know it's historically been THE multiplatform language....however there is a problem with that: I really don't like how Java forces EVERYTHING to be in the class structure thing, mainly because I like making stuff via Functions, only using classes as ""value-storage"". As far as I know, this same class heaviness goes to other JVM languages too like Scala, with the expections being Kotlin and Clojure.

So, Kotlin, right? It compiles to JVM but can be used in a less class heavy style. However, there is the problem that the project structure that it's build system (at least gradle) uses is highly inconvenient to my mainly command line, no IDE style, using a text editor style I like to use. The code is located under a dozen different directories and everytime I try to change it the build system dies.

Clojure then? But there the problem becomes that that afaik Clojure is not a straight-forward compiled language (to JVM) but like a mix of compiled and interpreted via the concept of ""The Reader"". Thus I think that it would violate the second ""rule"" of my self-imposed development style: ""Access to the program should not be beyond the scope of the average person"" In addition, this rules out most programming languages that cannot be easily cross-compiled as I consider having to compile the code from source as ""beyond the scope of an average person"". Or rather, I find it unreasonable to demand the average person to look into compiling something themselves in order to use something. In the languages I have considered this only rules out is C/C++ as it seems that cross-compiling on those languages is hard, or at least beyond my skill level or ability to understand.

So, Rust or Nim? As far as I know both of those languages have a sort of in-built system for cross-compiling (Rustup targets and Cargo on Rust, and the compiler itself on Nim). But neither of those languages is one that I like. In my opinion both of their syntax is bad, Nim looks like a Shell script trying to be a conding language (mainly due to the ""echo"" being the same as the ""echo"" command) and the Rust compiler is annoying because it complains about *how I name things*, forcing me to use snake\_case and type too many :: both of which I just find annoying. The same uglyness goes for Go, and generally I just don't know much about it.

Python?? It would also make sense as it's the language I originally got into programming with, but I haven't used it in a while and I have heard that it's generally considered to be a slow language and I don't know of ways to make Python projects not be something for which you need to install dependencies to get them to run if I am to use like pip-packages, and making someone download dependencies is something I view as on the same level as making people compile things from source: not reasonable to ask of the average person.

So, am I being too ""idealistic"" in this. Are my standards too high, or thoughts about these languages uninformed, or does a language like I want simply just not exists?",2024-11-05 10:07:42

learnprogramming,1gjo1ga,Im a fresh junior struggling in my first job,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gjo1ga/im_a_fresh_junior_struggling_in_my_first_job/,8,"TLDR: I recently got a job and Im not receiving (or at least I feel so) any training or even being told what to study by my own.

So I recently graduated from school and after a few months got my first job as a jr developer on Java, my first month is supposed to be a full training course on how they work. Sadly after my first two weeks I feel like im getting no training and struggling with the workflow.

My training consisted in a 4+ hours video from almost 10 years ago that explained how to create a simple CRUD on Java using a persons table from their DB. Pretty much all the code from BackEnd and FrontEnd that is required is autogenerated from .bat files and the video explains a little bit on some functions/files but not everything so a huge issue for me was trying to understand what each line of code is doing.

Also, i was never told that we use Hibernate and ExtJS, I have no experience with them and have no problem learning, but I find it hard to learn something when I dont even know what i need to search in the first place and when I'm doing questions they only talk to me about the files or the methods as if I knew all of them already.

The first issue is that some things that the video explicitly tells you to do are wrong because of how they work now and there are things that the video does not tell you and I should have done.

Once I got that done with help of my mentor (hes only about two years older than me and has been working here for less than 2 years. He has been really helpful most of the time, I simply dont know if he should be carrying the burden of the jrs), the next step was doing a similar crud on a different table.  
My main issues on this one were that no one told me that the design had to be different and the changes that they expected me to do even though it was ""a similar design"". Then when I was modifying the methods they use and asked about some errors I was getting, the response I got was that I wasnt supposed to modify the generic methods, instead I had to create my own methods, functions, API calls, everything.

The last problem I got was that I created my own function as I understood with the few knowledge I got and even though it was right (in the way that it solved the problem, surely it wasnt the correct or best solution) they told me it was wrong because deeply in some Java file they already got a function that does what I did. But again, my main complain is that nobody told me that before.

I know Im a fresh jr and there isnt a perfect work, especially one for someone who is in his first steps like me and probably is normal the frustration Im feeling. So my main question is: Am I in the wrong here? Was I expecting too much? How was the training (if you had any) during your first work as a junior developer?

**First**, I'd love some wisdom on the best way to go about learning programming, and some feedback if I'm on the right path. I'm really interested in artificial intelligence, specifically using it to develop education technology software, so my thought was to begin by doing one of Codecademy's courses on the very basics of Python, ML, and data science. Then, I'm planning to take a subsequent course on an introduction to ML to build my skills. I'm currently around 35% done with the Machine Learning and AI Fundamentals path on the platform, and finding the programming really interesting. I am excited to continue learning more and eventually build meaningful EdTech projects. I also have an interview for a web development fellowship tomorrow at a local university, so I'm hoping that will also give me further direction and experience. Are there any other programs I should participate in or skills I should learn before Python and ML?

learnprogramming,1gjbhd4,Help Needed: Algorithm for Fuel Consumption and FILL/THEFT Calculations Based on Tracker Data,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gjbhd4/help_needed_algorithm_for_fuel_consumption_and/,1,"Hello Reddit community,

I'm working on an algorithm to analyze fuel consumption and detect fuel FILL/THEFT events based on data received from a vehicle tracker. The data includes fuel sensor readings in real-time. My primary goal is to differentiate between natural consumption (due to driving) and sudden fluctuations which might indicate filling up or potential theft.

I’m using JavaScript/TypeScript for implementation and could use some guidance on how to handle:

1. **Accurate Consumption Tracking** \- Ensuring regular fuel drops due to vehicle usage are captured correctly without false positives.
2. **Fill/Refill Detection** \- Identifying significant positive jumps in fuel levels that indicate a refill.
3. **Theft Detection** \- Catching sudden drops that may point to fuel theft, while minimizing errors from sensor noise.

If you have experience with similar algorithms, data filtering techniques, or handling noisy sensor data, I’d really appreciate your insights. Feel free to share any tips or approaches that worked for you!

Thanks in advance for your help, and feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss further.

At my job where I am a systems engineer we use a tool called Cameo Systems Modeler.  I wrote some scripts in Python to scrape some of our code from our GitHub repos and create CSVs which I then sync into our model.

Cameo (owned by dassault systems now) is built in Java and provides some ability to do scripting in various languages including Jython and JavaScript (Rhino).

I've run across a couple of challenges:

 1) Java documentation is different than what MDN has for JS or any python library has.  Mainly the lack of examples.  It's also a bit hard for me to go through because I have to trace through a bunch of classes and inheritances to find out what can be used with what.

2) Apparently JS Rhino either doesn't use const and let or they are way different.  A simple declaration using const or let without any functions didn't work, but replacing with var made it work fine.

Is there anything else I should be on the lookout for when trying to interact with Rhino and/or Java libraries?  Also any good tips for navigating Java documentation?",2024-11-04 02:11:38

learnprogramming,1gi4te9,How To Become A Programmer For Anybody: Fundamentals,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gi4te9/how_to_become_a_programmer_for_anybody/,6,"Hey there everyone! I wanted to provide you all with a resource that I have been working on and refining for quite some time. It is not yet finished in its entirety, but there is a substantial portion that I believe will already be useful to many (I may break it up into separate readings). Personally I have been a long time follower of this community, and found several helpful resources, posts, and comments sharing general knowledge here. My career did not start in technology, but I continually developed my skills and studied several resources until I was finally able to get my foot in the door and break into the industry.

I can relate to the struggle of those who are self taught, and really do not have a guide post for which direction they should be taking their learnings. This field is so broad in and of itself, making the correct selection for what to study initially seems like an easy point to set yourself up for failure if you happen to choose wrong. The number of choices you can make is truly mind-numbing, but stumbling your way through a few can land you in the right place if you are lucky. For me, one of the hardest decisions to tackle was where to start.

This is where the resource I created comes in. The first section is an introduction to programming using Javascript as the programming language. One of the main goals with this was to not emphasize learning Javascript as a language in particular, but to provide the fundamental structure of programming languages through demonstrations. If you take on programming as a learning endeavor, or possibly career, you will be exposed to several languages. To a beginner, it seems that learning a specific language is the important part of establishing expertise. In reality though, gaining an understanding of the logical structure of languages, the concepts they use, and the concepts they are built around will help you become an expert more than anything.

I decided to provide this resource while it was still being built, due to my initial goal for it being that anyone who happened to get through it would very likely be able to acquire a job in this industry. That would be especially true if you are able to understand all of the material that it covers, and the site it was built with in reference. Practice will always help a great deal as well, but truly understanding the theory behind things will always be an asset for whatever task you happen to undertake. With this goal in mind, it lead to quite a bit of material that I had to write about and concepts that needed to be touched on. Ultimately, my end goal was to give a detailed explanation of the site this reading is paired with. The more I wrote, it started to appear to me that this may be over and beyond what many of you hoping to break into the industry would need.

Luckily, I broke the reading into sections to structure the content so that any individual that happened to read it would not have to continue with the web development portion if they did not choose to do so. If you are interested in web development, this portion of the reading may be very helpful. The topics themselves are written to be as generalizable as possible, so that if someone just wanted to learn programming and how to setup a basic environment, this would help them facilitate that. After going through the sections any particular individual would care for, I believe they would be able to focus on any domain of programming that they would happen to want to learn. Having this foundation would allow most to find any follow up material that may pertain to their particular interests, and the reading also lists a handful of additional resources that teach topics spanning across multiple domains within programming.

With all of that said, I created this resource so that it may not come across as daunting as others. Some of the courses I provide links to do go into more detail from a computer science standpoint, covering topics typically expected when learning theory. My intention was not to go into intimate detail on these topics, but leave the established resources to do this themselves (referring to CS50 and MITx).

Without further ado, I will provide a link to the resource below. The ""Fundamentals"" section is the only portion I consider fully fleshed out. I will try to tidy up the other sections and complete the last section that explains the site this reading is paired with, depending on if others find it helpful (I am still trying to decide if the last part is going to far). If this goes well, I may consider creating additional resources, possibly giving a look into backend development as well. Feel free to let me know what you think, and I will try to get back to questions regarding the resource and possibly topics in general. Best of luck!

TLDR: Above is a link to a book/reading (I hesitate to call it a book at this point) I created to learn programming. I hope that you find it helpful.



Edit: For those who happen upon this topic in the future, I wanted to point out some benefits of using `const` versus `let` for variables if you started the reading (this is actually addressing some concerns that were pointed out in the comments down below). In the past, I have seen that some programmers actually default to `let` for their variable assignments. In many examples of the reading, there are code snippets provided that do not reassign a variable's value. Due to this, using `const` is the more technically correct option, and demonstrates the intent of the variable at hand. In these cases I attempted to make it overly apparent to the reader that they would not have to worry about the value changing while we were exploring new concepts. Using `const` also leads to the topic of immutability, which is important to understand. 

Additionally, though the performance difference may be minor, this can give the Javascript engine opportunities to optimize the code better knowing that a variable is a `const` as compared to using a `let` assignment.  Some programmers can get tripped up by that fact that arrays and objects mutate despite using `const` (which is due to them still having the same original memory reference, which is explored in the reading), so instead they may default to `let` thinking that this is implying mutations can occur.

learnprogramming,1gi6xkw,Question: If you were to program purely for the love of it...,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gi6xkw/question_if_you_were_to_program_purely_for_the/,98,"If money or career did not exist. What language(s) would you choose? Why? What projects would you try to do?

The reason I'm asking: 25 years ago, I dropped out of Computer Science college after 2 years. I didn't like the way the curriculum was structured (too much concurrent subjects) and I was discouraged because I think I have a single-core brain... so I quit and chose a different career.

But recently I just retired, and for some reason right now, I've rediscovered my love for programming. So I wish to try again. It's exciting now because there are way more resources.

I remember some of the foundations I learned (Data Structures & Algorithms, System Architecture & Design, etc.) and I plan to relearn all of these.

But my question is: After learning the foundations, what languages or IDEs are best nowadays to learn good practices in programming? (during my time, the 90's, we studied Turbo C in Linux, and Borland C++ in Windows).

This is not for money, so I think a mess like JavaScript is something I would avoid. I didn't like learning it back then, and it seems just as much of a mess today looking at the state of it?

I heard good things about Rust? How about Erlang, Nim, Go? Why are they highly praised?

Any suggestions for a good roadmap? :)",2024-11-02 21:29:09

I’ll take responsibility here—I got lazy, lost motivation, and didn’t put in the work once classes went back in-person. Now, looking back, I really regret it.

I’ve recently been accepted into a Master’s program in the U.S., and I see this as a second chance to actually learn, gain skills, and hopefully land a solid job afterward. I know I can’t change the past, but I’m determined to turn things around and become a strong programmer. I just don’t want to go in feeling like it’s too late or that I can’t catch up.

So, my question is: am I on the right track? Can I realistically make up for lost time and become a good programmer during my Master’s? Any advice on how to tackle this, or resources I should focus on? I feel like I’ve got nothing left to lose, and I’m committed to making this work.

Settings would be a usual settings for social media apps.

Then it would have a message tab which include (message tab & comments/mention tab)

Overall : the user can upload a post which contains a couple of photos with a descriptions and other user can see it on the explore page and like it, or star it for personal savings (the user also can find the other user post that they follow under the following tab)

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts and perspective on the question. Given that many people spend over ten years in the field and can struggle with deceptively simple problems, I don’t think it has much to do with the number of years anyone’s been programming.

My answer to the question is that you have to develop a natural knack for the field and be able to operate at a level that’s intuitive.

This implementation needs to ""wrap around"" and replace vues at the tail once it becomes full.

I am playing with re-implementing an actively developed C application in another programming language. I have written a small scraper that goes through their sources and emits all of the relevant ""API"" that I have to reimplement in  the other programming language in order to implement their runtime. I produce stubs for the target language which have to be implemented and I keep them all in their own directory, named ""stubs"". The amount of produced files is 1:1 with the original sources. I keep each extracted API function in a file with the same name as the original file. That let me script my text editor so I can easily open the original source file in another window if I need to look at the original source for some reason. I have a ""src"" directory to which I move a stub-file I work with.

My question is, what is a better practice: from time to time, say once a year, I will re-generate stubs to catch-up with the original (at least my plan). The amount of source files is moderate, about 110+ files and some of them can be relatively large. Every time I would re-generate, and push generated code into the repo, it means that the git will store lots and lots of data which is probably not needed. I currently have stubs directory ignored in my git. However, I am thinking of opening my repo or at least inviting some people to take a look at it. If someone would help me to implement some features, than it might be good to work on the same version of generated stubs.

I am principally against checking in machine-generated code. If it can be re-generated in a git hook, or by some other tool, I see no reason to enlarge the database with useless data, but I am not sure in this case. What do you guys think? What are your experiences with machine generated code, and do you possibly have a suggestion?",2024-11-02 14:43:23

In the tree itself I want the tags to be displayed (with setData). Since only the Tag names are saved inside the QTreeWidgetItem class I wanted to extend this class to save a pointer to it's corresponding xmlElement:

    class XMLTreeWidgetItem : public QTreeWidgetItem
    {
    public:
        XMLTreeWidgetItem(tinyxml2::XMLElement* xmlElement);
        virtual ~XMLTreeWidgetItem() {};
    
        tinyxml2::XMLElement* getXmlElement() const;
    
    private:
        tinyxml2::XMLElement* xmlElement;
    };

I want to display the content of the xmlElement inside a TextEdit. And this TextEdit's text has to change depending on which Item/Element is selected inside the QTreeWidget by the user. This is the event handler:

    void MainWindow::on_XMLTreeWidget_itemSelectionChanged()
    {
        qDebug() << ""selection changed"";
        QTreeWidgetItem* item = ui->xmlTreeWidget->currentItem();
        XMLTreeWidgetItem* selectedItem = (XMLTreeWidgetItem*)item;
    
        qDebug() << selectedItem->getXmlElement()->GetText();

The problem:

After some time a segmentation fault occurs exactly at `GetText()`

`qDebug() << selectedItem->getXmlElement()` works just fine.

`qDebug() << selectedItem->getXmlElement()->GetText()`   gives seg fault after some time.

When in the debugger I can see that xmlElement is not a nullptr and points to a tinyxml2::XMLElement.

How do I get the text?

I’m curious to know, for those of you who are beginners or still getting the hang of deployment, what are the biggest hurdles you’re facing? Are there specific areas that are particularly confusing or frustrating?

I’d love to hear about your experiences. Maybe we can share some tips, resources, or tools that have helped along the way.

learnprogramming,1gi4vrl,how to organize information and files,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gi4vrl/how_to_organize_information_and_files/,0,"hello, so i have a folder right, the folder is called workspaces, it is located like in my users folder so i can access it faster from the terminal or so i think. inside this folder, right now there are a few folders i keep in there, called: algorithms, cheatsheet, java, openai, python, scripts, webdev. and like, i've barely done any programming at all tbh despite being a fourth year (haha mcdonalds here i come) but that ties into the point, of how currently i am uncertain as to how to organize it.

inside my webdev folder, for example, i have separate folders for courses, and another folder for projects. and of course i would add things, probably ad hoc, in my case it wouldn't be organized anywhere near perfect i'd just put it there for a while and then later someday put it into some category for possibly easier access. but lots of projects and things require lots of different languages, so i'm wondering, how to take account of that if needed. maybe i should have an overall projects section in my main folder in workspaces, heck to make it seem simpler or more accessible, maybe i have a folder called languages where i then make folders for things like java and python, and then inside that python folder, for example, i have more python projects and courses and idk example files as notes or something. just not sure, maybe anything that can be grouped together and accessed efficiently for some purpose may as well seem decent enough, but then what purpose and what serves things better. 

not expecting a one-size-fits-all explanation, but just any legit real explanation would help. how do i organize it to like, be conducive to productivity, be open to considering more possibilities, at a balanced pace etc. i don't really want to be caught up in how to organize it like, the best way, cause it's probably just me procrastinating learning actual info, info that might also just be all the more overwhelming and unpleasant the worse that organization is. tell me, is it really that everyone naturally has it organized in their brains, or is there some principle or thing i am severely lacking in. organizing code files may be just a small seeming step, but just how, how do i do it, because this here seems to be getting in my way and idk how to deal with it.

learnprogramming,1ghgg0e,Today I realized just how important creating functions is and just how helpful it is to divide problems into simpler objectives.,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ghgg0e/today_i_realized_just_how_important_creating/,5,"So, I was working on a problem about finding like the largest connected cells in a matrix. At first it looked so complex to me. I did not know how I would traverse the matrix and find connected cells etc. So, I decided not to think about it. In my main function I just wrote the code assuming a secondary function would do the actual solving for me. In the secondary function too I used another function to divide the problem further. I solved the problem with recursion.



 I know there are better ways to solve it. But the way in which the problem became simpler because I could just worry about the actual implementation later meant that I could keep focusing on one thing at a time and slowly move deeper into the problem. It was like magnifying the one step at a time. Going from a macroscopic implementation, slowly into nitty gritty.

I’m really struggling with my degree, and I’m hoping to hear from others who might have gone through something similar. Last year, I took admission in Software Engineering – honestly, partly because my family thought it would be a stable, “smart” choice. I had started learning some basic Python online before uni, and at that time, I thought coding wasn’t so bad. Python was simple enough, and I even had fun building small stuff like a calculator. But now, everything feels different.

Once I got into university, they started us on C++, and it felt way harder. I missed a few classes early on because of travel, and then it was like I couldn’t catch up. Somehow, I scraped by in the first semester, but it wasn’t great. In the second semester, I even failed a lab because I missed a test (couldn’t make it due to rain and no car at home). I knew I was struggling, but instead of being able to switch, I ended up right back in software engineering. My family convinced me to try again, saying that other fields, like business or design, “aren’t worth it.”

The thing is, I do think Software Engineering is a solid degree, but I just can’t seem to enjoy it. Coding feels like a chore, and it’s frustrating because I want to make the best of this degree, but I don’t love it. The whole idea of spending hours coding or debugging just drains me. I’m actually more interested in the design and interactive side of things, but the heavy focus on coding isn’t clicking with me.

So, I’m curious if anyone else has been in this position – feeling like you’re stuck with a degree that doesn’t feel right, but trying to make the best of it. Is it even possible to make yourself like programming if you’ve already decided it’s not for you? If anyone has tips or stories on how they made coding less of a headache (or even enjoyable), I’d love to hear it.

I've encountered the following situation:
```
class HistogramFactory {
    static HistogramFactory *instance;
protected:
    HistogramFactory() {}

    virtual PrintableChars *getPrintableChars() = 0;

HistogramFactory *HistogramFactory::getInstance() {

The problem is that I can't do this: `instance = new HistogramFactory();` since HistogramFactory is abstract. So, aside from making the method virtual (which I don't want to do because I need it as an interface method), what can I do? I tried making the choice of which factory to use at the time `getInstance()` is called, by passing an enum (like `getInstance(factoryType)`), but this doesn't feel correct, because on subsequent calls to `getInstance()`, I wouldn’t be able to change the instance, even though the method suggests otherwise.

The only idea that comes to mind at this point is to make each factory implementation a singleton, but wouldn't that prevent the use of multiple factories? Let me explain better: for example, when I use a look and feel (i.e., I have an abstract factory to create different looks and feels based on the target platform), in an application, I only use the chosen one. Therefore, it shouldn’t be possible to create more than one look and feel within the same application.

I am taking a college course called data analytics with Python. The problem we are given is that we need to do a cleaning with list comprehensions to single out anagrams of a word given a text file.

Then a dictionary is created with all the words in the file as keys but having empty values.

The next part specifies that we create a list comprehension to go through the file again and then append the unsorted words To the dictionary as values where the sorted words are the keys thus creating a key value relationship where the keys are the words and the values are all the anagrams of that word.

However, I cannot find a method where this can be done.

just learning react and I have high doubts that I am taking the concept of raising the state wrong or maybe just thinking too much idk.  
sooo, here is the thing I am making a simple resume builder where you input your details on the left side and it is showed on the right side in like a resume formatting.

I use userTemplate.js to hold the basic template of the User which i import in app.jsx.

then I have left pane which goes to compnents like generalDetails, skills, education details, project details, work experience where there is a form where the user makes changes to the data.

check the Flowchart here: [https://webwhiteboard.com/board/uXjVLKwi6Yw=/?boardAccessToken=HHf15TE4JWhOnq3dnJkjESYt85MeIt4y](https://webwhiteboard.com/board/uXjVLKwi6Yw=/?boardAccessToken=HHf15TE4JWhOnq3dnJkjESYt85MeIt4y)

check the git repo here (this is an old version) of the same website: [https://github.com/tushar-droid/cv-builder.git](https://github.com/tushar-droid/cv-builder.git)

Live here: [https://cv-builder-5ufbv43h8-tushar-droids-projects.vercel.app/](https://cv-builder-5ufbv43h8-tushar-droids-projects.vercel.app/)

so now, since I want the changes to be done in the components but have to be reflected in the right pane but the state is in app.jsx. all my changeHandler logic is situated in the app.jsx. I wanted to have all that changeHandler logic in the components I guess. maybe the component is just supposed to have the html/layout.

so the state has to be passed through the props from app.jsx  -> leftPane -> generaldetails/skills/education......, etc. to make changes to the data.

and then passed from app.jsx -> rightPane to show data.

is it how it is supposed to be or is there another way of doing this???????",2024-11-01 21:38:15

I've been doing random scripts or configs when I was a kid, did some basic programming, after a while got into a programming undergrad was pretty fun and learnt a lot by myself, I already knew lot of stuff, did some games on assembler, then I interrupted it just before getting into the more ""real development"" courses and lectures, after that I joined recently a Computer Science career for the math and the theoretical stuff.

Recently trying to switch into development, while I'm kind of a really bad operational guy that is disguised somehow as a jr data engineer on a really unorganized company, given that I don't have development knowledge, I was searching for job title/role that sound interesting but filtering on internet right now is painful, everything goes back to some kind of webdev roadmap, and every job listing is a list of random services without any context.

When I decided to make this post I was motivated by the idea that maybe I'm focusing too much on trying to get a job as a ""dev"", doesn't matter how contradictory generic that may sound, and given that everything looks like some kind of backend or webdev, it became harder when trying to pick between going the relative known route of web dev or picking some unrelated curious topic, which would probably delay my switch into dev. E.G. there are stuff that I find interesting like compilers, CLI tools, tooling engineering in general, connecting stuff to interact with each other, but that doesn't seem to be a safer route.

Currently my plan is somehow integrating PostgreSQL, Golang, AWS, Gin and Docker everything together to make some kind of weird web app I guess, not really following anything in particular just some AWS course to learn the platform, and learning mostly about actual agnostic webdev, for example following the MERN tutorial to try coming with the same stuff in Go.

I always admired people like Tsoding for example, I just wanna have a necessity of some kind and program it, I know he probably work in the meantime as another backend webdev, but his skills seems more broad and I admire people capable of just having a problem and having the broad knowledge to know where to find the information, given this last point, me focusing in a lot of broad topics would probably be non-beneficial to switch my job faster, but then I wondered if there are known projects that would teach me somehow indirectly, or atleast hint, what is the real development lifecycle in general.",2024-11-01 08:27:16

Currently I am at the stage wanting to share my app to a closed group but before that I want to make and admin dashboard for user management creating,blocking, etc and need to maybe edit some data when users get problems etc. Now I want to create another application same type of backend with a connection to its own postgres database and a connection to the actual application database and then thinking of just also having a flutter frontend for the dashboard. Because there is still a chance that the actual application keeps expanding the admin dash also needs to keep expanding to view the data etc, now the domain model in my java application is still fairly small and still simple to modify, I don't really want to do that twice in the future. what are my options for keeping a overview of my application and not having to update  the dashboard and when updating the application. 

This is what my model currently looks like

Application  
Flutter(frontend) ------- Java(Backend) ------database

\^

Dashboard (application )                                      |

Flutter(frontend) -------------------------------Java(Backend) -----------database

  
But I don't want to copy the domain model from the application to the dashboard as the would be a lot of work keeping it up to date in the future.

Some ideas that I found I could do still would need to work out how I am going to do this:

\- expose some api endpoints the admin dashboard instead of a direct database access

\- expose a GraphQL API endpoint from the application its self that my admin frontend could reach

a suggested architecture was to make a:

* **Shared Library:** A Java library with domain models, repositories, and any common services.
* **Main Application Backend:** Continues to handle the core application functionality, exposing admin-specific endpoints or GraphQL queries/mutations.
* **Admin Dashboard Backend:** Uses the shared library for domain models and calls the main application backend’s admin endpoints for data and management functions.

  
So I am curious on what you guys think is best, what strategy I should take for making a dashboard

I hope it is clear what I am trying to ask!",2024-11-01 20:24:48

learnprogramming,1gh5amr,When to use DTOs and what DTOs to build?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gh5amr/when_to_use_dtos_and_what_dtos_to_build/,7,"I'm learning API development in Go and am wondering about the ""best practices"" for abstracting data. DTOs make sense in the abstract (no pun intended), but I find that I'm asking myself if I'm using them in a way that makes sense and isn't just adding more lines of code (see: technical debt) for not a lot of benefit.

I've used them in other languages to make method requests and response blueprints. For example, a POST request in my system would have object properties besides the database-generated ID, and the response would be the same as the GET endpoint's response DTO. It would look a bit like this:

\`\`\`go

type GetLocationDTO struct {

LocationId	 string \`json:""location\_id""\` // a guid

    LocationName string `json:""location_name""`
    
    Description 	 string `json:""description""`

}  
\`\`\`



\`\`\`go

// post

type CreateLocationDTO struct {

    LocationName string `json:""location_name""`
    
    Description 	 string `json:""description""`

}

\`\`\`

Where the GET DTO is effectively the same as the base model. This raises a couple of questions:

1. Do I necessarily need a DTO for GET if it is the same shape as the model? Do I bother creating a DTO for a situation that \*could\* arise where the shapes differ, or should I keep it as lean as possible and worry about updating later? Less code is probably better, but I can see the utility in setting up the abstraction now.
2. Do I need a separate DTO for POST operations? Or should I use the base model with defaults/zero values in spots where the request would not have values (like a blank string for \`location\_id\`)

I'm specifically working in Go for this project, but general DTO-based best practice advice is equally valuable.",2024-11-01 13:24:04

Need help intelligently matching user inputted free-form text to the description, and returning the corresponding code.



Background:

I am building a medical pricing website. The user inputs free form text (à la Google) describing the condition and receives pricing at local hospitals.

Medical billing is a labyrinth, separated into inpatient and outpatient services and diagnosis codes. A diagnosis code (ICD10) will usually translate into an inpatient code (DRG), but not always. Other times, ICD10 codes will translate to the wrong DRG code. 

I have been using a forward searching approach, searching first for the ICD10 code and translating it to a DRG. As an example, a search for ""heart transplant"" yields the ICD10 code Z94.1 which corresponds to DRGs 314-316 (""Other Circulatory System Diagnoses""). In fact, DRGs 001 and 002 (""Heart Transplant"") are more correct, but do not have a corresponding ICD10 code. 

[CMS.gov](http://CMS.gov) has appendices that list exactly which ICD10 corresponds with which DRG as well as DRG numbers and descriptions. Not all DRGs have a corresponding ICD10 code, so **I will have to match the user-inputted free form text to DRGs directly.**



Things I have explored:

String matching using Jaccard Distance/ Levenshtein Distance/ Jaro-Winkler: not the best since most laypeople will not know the exact medical terminology (""snoring"" symptom vs ""sleep apnea"" medical term)

Zero-shot approach with Gemini and OpenAI. Both AIs will hallucinate and return the wrong DRGs. 

* Fine tuning: OpenAI, Gemini, and Llama3.2 both require a question and answer dataset, best if 50 examples per classification (DRG code). This is... not easy and probably not going to be very accurate. Hard to guess what a user might input in free form text.
* Corpus of documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): LangChain Vectara, Gemini, Vertex AI for RAG: This is a promising option but examples on the [Vectara](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/providers/vectara/vectara_summary/) site show that this approach is better for summarizing, or retrieving relevant ""chunks"", than strict regurgitation.
* Vertex AI for tabular data: similar challenges with providing examples for fine tuning
* QLoRA/ LoRA: probably much more technically oriented and more than I need, also increased hardware requirements.

Giving OpenAI/ Gemini a complete list of all the DRG descriptions with each prompt, asking the AI to match with the appropriate entry. This would use a large number of tokens ($) for every prompt. Is there a way to keep this in memory? Is that what the Corpus is? If I provide a text file as a document in the Corpus, is the AI smart enough to match the user input to the DRG description in the file and return the corresponding DRG code in the file in a different column?",2024-11-01 17:36:05

I'm a self-taught learner in computer science. While I've come a long way, I don’t feel fully ready to apply for a job just yet.

With all the changes happening due to AI, I’m concerned about finding a junior-level job. AI seems to be taking over tasks that used to be entry-level, and now senior developers are able to accomplish even more with its help. I’ve noticed that some companies are even laying off employees as a result.

What should I focus on as a junior to improve my chances of finding a job? Are there specific skills or areas I should prioritize in my learning? And is it likely that layoffs will continue as AI advances?",2024-11-02 00:08:57

I’m developing a WPF application using C# and EF Core that connects to an SQL database, which will be accessible online. The app will only have two to three users max who will access it from their personal computers, but I’m worried about the security of this setup. The database will have less than 30 tables.

My main question is:

are online databases unsafe even though they have a username and password in the connection string? What additional risks should I be aware of, especially considering the limited number of users?

Also, I’m unsure which specific database service provider I will be using, options include Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or Supabase. How might the choice of provider impact security? Additionally, should I consider a paid option, or is it feasible to go the free route if possible?

I also don’t know whether to use an API layer for database access or connect directly to the database from the App. Which route is the right one for my situation?

Additionally, I have an export/import functionality in the app that will be used to back up the database periodically. Would this be enough from a security standpoint? My thinking is that even if the database isn’t completely secure, I’d always have a backup. In the worst-case scenario, if anything happens to the database, I’d still have a backup to rely on.

If you have any insights or recommendations on securing the database and best practices for this scenario, I would greatly appreciate your advice!

Im currently on my second year of my 2 year technical career (BTEC  or NHD in Uk or Associate degree in USA) 

So far I have acquired a fair knowledge of java , linux, windows server, databases (oracle sql developer) , how to connect them to a program,  how to test my code with junit, how to create and connect  services and processes (processbuilder, fork, all that) how to use java fxml, how to make simple functional interfaces, etc BUT… 

I don’t feel like I could solve a single problem without external help . In fact  I’m sure  I cant even be able to solve a simple assignment without having to look up code in my resources or ask chat gpt for instructions on how should I face said assignment. I understand for loops, conditionals , create methods to make my code reusable etc but I just cant type the solution by myself  using just my knowledge. It just doesn’t “click” inside my brain  … im very reliant on external help.

If you asked me right now to write a method that takes an array of numbers and sort them out from lowest to highest. Im pretty sure i wont be able to solve it… or even if i did it would require and absurd amount of time.

If you told me the solution i would understand your code without you having to explain it to me, but as I said, I could not type it myself. 

All this makes me feel like despite being halfway through my degree Im a complete fraud. As far as coding goes. 

Also I work and study at the same time so I can’t dedicate myself fully to learn because the little time I get I dedicate it to catching up with my classes. Which translates at me just  barely scraping the surface of the knowledge of what I should  be learning.

After some research and scrolling, I realized that most small businesses and everyday users who want websites typically ask for them on platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, GoDaddy—you name it. Basically, these are more ""no-code"" platforms, and I’ve noticed that the market seems to be shifting toward these types of technologies.

There's is this one specific problem that I'm currently trying to fix.

How can I make my animations smooth?

I use intersection observer API to detect elements from the screen, Anime.js to start the animation that the intersection observer detected, and useState, useRef, and useEffect React hooks to render the elements.

The problem is that the animation is delayed, it starts when the elements appears on the screen. I want it to be smooth like it will animate first before the element is rendered on screen.

This is the link to my web port folio

    interface CreateIntersectionObserverProps {
        hasAnimated: boolean,
        setHasAnimated: (hasAnimated: boolean) => void,
    } // this are useState's state variable and state setter

I am trying to make TypeScript debugging  work in an existing project/solution in VS Code . The initial developer told me that he didn’t use breakpoints, he used `console.log()` instead. I’m tired of debugging this way, especially for complex issues.

I have read various explanation, none of which precisely matched this solution/application case. The project uses Nx , and this seems (and maybe some other things) to be a reason why many standard examples I consulted cannot be applied for all kinds of reasons.

The command used to run the application in local environment is

`npx nx run [launch project name]:serve --port 4300`

 

**Tried**

Compiling information from various examples, I tried various configurations in launch.json including the following ones (also tried using the lines that are commented)

    ""configurations"":
    [
               {
                ""name"": ""node.js - Attach (not failing but not working, has no effect)"",

                //""port"": 4300,

                    ""<node_internals>/**""
                ],
                ""type"": ""node"",
                ""restart"": true
                //""program"": ""${workspaceFolder}/helloworld.ts"", //This line from  is not allowed
            },
    {
                ""name"": ""Launch Brave against localhost (not working: does not find 'debuggable target')"",
                ""type"": ""chrome"",
                ""port"": 9222,

                ""port"": 9222,

            },
    
    (...)
    ]https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-debugginghttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-debugging

When the first configuration is launched, some kind of blue/white “progress/wait” bar animates  in “Run And Debug”. But when it stop there is no sign of error or success.

 Debugging still has no effect, no visible variables, not breakpoints reached.

I’m not sure if VSCode contains a TypeScript debugger, I installed the extensions “TypeScript Debugger” by kakumei (because it like on of the most popular targeting TypeScript). Still, no effect.

 How can I diagnose this further and solve it? Thank you

 

**Edit: Recent observation**

I just noticed that when I run

`npx nx run customer:serve --port 4300`

Console mentions:

`Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:[random port]/36a96853-667a-40bf-b182-e4f9ceea0821`

`(...)`

`Debugger attached.`

I am not sure where this URL:port comes from, I do not use [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1) , I use localhost.

And I see a red bar at the bottom of VS code that mentions things that seem related to this debugger/configuration (the name of the first configuration here above it displayed), but breakpoints are still not reached, though they turned to empty black on white circles.

**Edit: Recent observation 2**

I just noticed the following:

In Run And Debug > Breakpoints:

\- ""Caught Exception"" and ""Uncaught Exceptions"" are disable by default. If I enable them, debugger indeed stops at Exceptions. I cannot keep these enable however at countless exceptions happen in compiled JavaScript which I believe is part of the countless dependencies of the frontend application.

\- Top right or this section, there is a  ""Toggle Activate Breakpoints"" (or something like this, I cannot read the full text as it only display on mouseHover but then the mouse pointer hide a part of it). When I click this, the breakpoints I set in my code change from and empty black circle to a filled black circle. However, the breakpoints are still not reached when running the application.

So, the debugger seems to do a part of its jobs, just not breakpoints...

**\*\*New observations 3\*\***

I just noticed that:

* Not just one but 2 debuggers get attached when I server/build the project
* The debuggers get attached when I build the project using `npx nx run [project name]:build`, I would not expect any debugger to attach while building, I feel like it's adding unnecessary workload (compile time longer, more computer fan noise)",2024-10-31 10:17:28

- Data Analysis/Data Science: I’d start with data analysis using Power BI and SQL, then transition to Data Science/Machine Learning with Python. This path would involve time-intensive coursework in my master’s program and extra study with resources like Introduction to Statistical Learning.

- Web Development: I’m considering using The Odin Project as a structured guide. Eventually, I’d like to transition into web app development, which also has a significant learning curve but feels very project-focused and directly applicable.

Given my master’s commitments, I can’t pursue both paths as each requires extensive time investment. Even during the Master, there is a ML path and a regular CS path and I will have to make a choice.

I’d appreciate any thoughts, especially if you’ve had to make a similar decision. Thanks in advance!",2024-10-31 05:05:57

I’m planning a project that involves combining a Unity game with a cross-platform app. I have experience with Android Studio and React Native, and while I’ve never tried combining a mobile app with Unity.

The app will function like an app store: the user will be able to select a game from a list, which will then open directly. Think of it like the setup in Duolingo, where users select a lesson and jump right into it.

Originally, I planned to use React Native as the main platform for the app because it's familiar, but I’m unsure if it’s the best fit for this type of setup. Would another framework, like Flutter, be a better fit? Also, are there specific issues or limitations I should be aware of when using React Native alongside Unity?

Any insights, experiences, or recommendations would be super helpful. Thanks so much in advance! ",2024-10-31 14:15:55

I’m working on a QR code decoding project from scratch without using libraries, and I’m really stuck on reading the encoding bits correctly. I’ve followed every step I can think of, but the results are just not making sense, so I thought I’d reach out here to see if anyone has any ideas.

Here’s where I’m at:

1. **Zigzag Ordering**: I’ve read the bit string in the correct “zigzag” order, so I know I’m reading the bits in the proper sequence.
2. **Masking Visualized**: I have a tool that helps me visualize the QR code before and after applying the mask, and I’ve manually verified that the masking is indeed applied correctly. So, I’m confident that my bit data is accurate.
3. **Expected Encoding Bits**: Based on Wikipedia’s documentation, the first four bits should represent the encoding type, and they should match one of these values:
   * `0001` for Numeric encoding (10 bits per 3 digits)
   * `0010` for Alphanumeric encoding (11 bits per 2 characters)
   * `0100` for Byte encoding (8 bits per character)
   * `1000` for Kanji encoding (13 bits per character)

The problem? I’m getting sequences of four bits that don’t match any of these encoding types. The results almost feel “random” across multiple test QR images. I’ve triple-checked my masking, ordering, and starting position, so I’m at a loss for what could be causing this.

The QR code I'm putting is one I generated online containing only a few numbers to test the ""numeric"" encoding type and yet, upon reading the bits, I get: `1101` which obviously does not match any pattern listed above. Does anybody know what could be going on? (EDIT: Actually I just realized I can't put images on the post so you'll have to take my word for it)",2024-10-31 04:11:21

* Pure SQL solutions - an interesting constraint that forces you to think differently
* Database agnostic (though tested on PostgreSQL)
* Ranges from straightforward to ""wow, you can do that in SQL?""

Why SQL? While we often treat SQL as just a way to fetch data, it's actually a pretty powerful language in its own right. Some of these puzzles could be solved in a few lines of Python or JavaScript, but solving them in SQL often requires a complete mental shift in how you approach the problem.

The challenges will be available at [https://adventofsql.com](https://adventofsql.com) starting December 1st.

Need Advice.,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gfv11f/is_programmingcoding_right_for_me_need_advice/,18,"Hello, I have been working on The Odin Project for around 8 months now. I am 23. (Web Dev Course) I am going through a computer science section right now working with hash maps and binary trees. I hate doing this stuff. I try to work on it for 2 hours everyday, and since I have hit the comp sci section I avoid working like the plague. 

However, I have had loads of fun and fulfillment working on my own personal projects earlier on. I built sort of an RPG game that plays like Darkest Dungeon, and I started working on a D&D Beyond clone(ish) that I got stuck on because I don't know any backend yet. Also worked on a OneNote clone, that looks EXACTLY like OneNote just doesn't function like it yet.

The D&D Beyond clone is really my dream project, and I want to work on it but I need to learn how to set up the backend because the whole thing depends on accounts and log-in type stuff. I could skip a bunch of lessons and just learn backend, but I really feel like thats just a bad idea. I want to try to push and go through it linearly, but maybe that is stupid and I should just learn my own way.

I think I just absolutely despise working on anything that isn't related to something I actually care about. So these lessons where they want me to make some small app to learn about concept I just end up not doing that and implementing it into my game or something instead. I just don't care about hash maps until I absolutely need it, does that make sense?

I get discouraged when I see others online that are literally in LOVE and are fascinated by hash maps, or whatever low level comp-sci thing. I just cannot relate to that at all. But I enjoy making things with it. (when it works lol) And I guess you could say that I am more of a visual person? All of my apps are UI heavy and I love good UI and the challenge of making optimal UI.

Anyway, kind of a two-pronged question I guess.

(this is not about AI taking jobs i promise) ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gg5x4s/am_i_being_to_reliant_on_ai_this_is_not_about_ai/,7,"Don't worry, this post isn't about AI taking jobs or anything like that. For the past year, I've been learning web development and building side projects. Obviously, when doing these things, you need to look up how to do certain things like authentication or React context hooks—things you might not know off the dome. However, in my building process, I've been turning to AI to learn how to do things like write API calls or implement a Context hook to give my web apps structure.

My question is: is it bad to learn this way? I think I could write an API call from scratch at this point, but Context is something I don’t think I could do from memory or implement without looking things up. I always make sure I fully understand the code I use in my projects, but since models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet can quickly generate examples I can analyze and adapt (like using Supabase for auth, for example), it’s a lot easier than scanning through StackOverflow or other forums and docs.

I guess I just struggle to feel like a ""real"" programmer if I’m not working through forums to learn how to do something. I’m curious if using AI this way is something I should refrain from. Thanks!",2024-10-31 03:58:14

I've tried researching this on my own but Google searches haven't returned the answers I'm looking for.

Background: We have some use case ideas for using gen AI in our software, but have some high-level questions about doing that:

1. How are other software tools handling this? Are they using proprietary LLMs (like OpenAI) and just making API calls every time? Or, do they use open source LLMs on premise?
2. If they're just making API calls, how do you handle data privacy? I know many of our clients won't like having their data shared with a third party.
3. How do you manage usage costs? I've looked into how that's calculated, and it appears to be able to get out of hand very quickly.
4. How do you avoid getting locked into a specific LLM or LLM version?

As I start my masters next year I will have a lot more time and want to start working on some projects to see what I really enjoy. 

One if my modules recently was Information Systems which I loved. The main project we did was designing and building an asp.net website for managing data in various departments for a made up company. The main component was the relational database design and development but I really enjoyed the query processing and development in Visual Basic (I have prev experience with). 

Now, I would really like to create my own site from scratch to expand my skills. I also have a speaker rental business I have been running for a couple of years with friends so would like to build a system for storing data and the ability to generate invoices and track salaries etc etc. More challenging to me though will be setting up all the cloud services required to run it. I also would like to keep the cost of this as low as possible as I am mostly learning and although I think the IS is important… it may not be essential to the business rn.


It would be amazing to get some general points to where I can learn and get up and running with setting up instances, environments to use and other tips for starting out. I really don’t want to delve too deep into the details, but learn enough to gain a lot of experience from this. Ultimately- I want to focus on building the relational-database and the site and would like to do it relatively quickly.

The course I was going through is very project based and I feel like that's the best way to learn. However, unlike a college class, you don't have a professor or TA you can talk to. Although some courses you see might have some kind of support area, help and/or guidance is limited at best.

In my case (if it matters, I am going through a Tim Corey course), I finished building a Battleship clone app for the console. After that, however, life started to happen and I couldn't easily focus on that for several months. So I took an extended break. I know the simple answer is to simply DO IT like Shia LeBeouf, but it's not that simple for me. I'm concerned that due to taking several months off, I may have lost some fundamental knowledge like OOP things. I have practice projects to refer to, but I guess I'm just concerned that due to my break, I can't easily implement/build things on my own anymore.

I guess to get to the meat of the question, I'm wondering if I should consider completely starting over from scratch on the course to be safe, or maybe review OOP concepts in some smaller way? If it matters, for example, the topics I'm thinking of are class types, how to instantiate them, using namespaces, etc.

I created function whose task it is to unlock one button after 3 uses of another (any) buttons. The problem is it should unlock after full execution of those other buttons wich is to select ability, chose target then decrease count to unlock. Rn it works before selecting target so i can just click 3x (it’s unlocked after 3 usage of other skills) and it unlocks, without finishing selecting target. To prevent such thing i have „isAbilityInUse” this prevents stacking, so if you click normal attack 3 times without selecting target (lets assume it deals 10 dmg) it will do 10dmg not 30dmg
Second thing to prevent this is await, function that unlock that locked skill is waiting for another function to finish. I will take Normal Attack to the example. Click normal attack, now selecting target shows up and its waiting until finish selection then runs rest of the code.
From here function unlocking should work after all this but it seems it works even if normal attack is not finished so the result is unlocking button that is blocked

Background:

I started my first dev job 9 months ago. I am a career changer, but managed to work hard, study and interview with a consulting firm to be a junior dev for them.

I work for a FinTech company, working with a very niche product used in payments solutions. I use Java, Spring, Docker, Mongo etc every day.

I was mostly used to JS, and React, so when I was put forward to interview for this role, I was quite surprised to be hired and now offered a permanent position at the company starting in January.

The company admits to throwing myself(and the rest of the new hires) into the deep end with this project we're on, and we didn't really receive much training, just learning as you go. There really is very little support except for one senior dev who is very busy with this project. I should mention, 1 other senior and 2 juniors originally on the project left it due to the stress.

Anyway, I work with brilliant devs, and the other dev(Junior) who was also hired with me and on my team, comes from a tech background and graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in this country.

He's a great resource to learn from, and he completes his tickets quickly. He has accelerated to mid-dev level already. He's also always willing to help and teach, which is so beneficial. 

Problem is, I feel like I get compared to him sometimes which is affecting my confidence level. I know my co-worker is the exception to the rule, but still...I want to improve my skills so I can build my confidence.

I have been learning more intermediate Java using Hyperskill and Udemy courses. Reviewing the code/projects I have been working on during my 9 months on this project(I've worked on 6 different projects). Asking questions(every day).

Now:

I still struggle with debugging/problem-solving. My line manager says it takes time, and to not be so hard on myself...but is there anything else I can do? or any advice a senior can share with me?

I worry I am too slow or not smart enough, though that hasn't been the feedback I've been given. Just wondering if there's any way to improve or develop problem-solving skills etc.?

Is it more effective to have some kind of MySQL stored procedure run on a monthly/quarterly  trigger that creates an empty assigned form every month/quarter for every assignment (could be thousands of entries), or should the web server run a cron job to insert those empty assignments? Or are there better options that I'm not considering? 

I've tried coming up with a query that notes missing months/quarters, but I don't have a good way to make sure that an assigned form was ""active"" during the missed time periods with my current DB structure. ",2024-10-30 17:44:30

While I’m comfortable with Python and Django’s ORM, request handling, and all the Django goodies, I’m finding the transition to the JavaScript ecosystem a bit overwhelming.

# Here's where I'm at:

* I've set up a basic Express server and understand routing and middleware, but I'm still figuring out best practices.
* In Django, I rely heavily on the ORM and Django's built-in tools. In Node, I'm experimenting with MongoDB and Mongoose, which feels like a big shift.
* I'm also not sure how to structure my project. Django’s MVC pattern is familiar, but Express seems to have more flexibility (or chaos?) when it comes to structuring things.

Udemy, Coursera, Odin Project, on and on and on, there is nothing that teaches fullstack - they spend almost entire courses on frontend, and then toss in two sections about Node and APIs.  Fucking worthless.  There are some newer YT videos with tuts using different stacks, often pushing people to use Supabase, or something similar.  None of this is teaching fullstack development though.

I want to learn token creation and handling, I want to learn exactly how data moves between database and client, I want to learn best practices for data security, etc.  A monkey could spin up a Node server after any of these courses, but could never come close to building a functional fullstack app.  I'm sick of these courses that don't teach you a fucking thing, or the tuts that just do ""code alongs"" and don't explain anything at all about what's going on.

It'd be in my own time so not in any kind of major time crunch or anything. 

But there's three major areas I'm kind of unsure in. 
1. Hosting, who are some good options for hosting? 

2. Storage, are there any solutions out there for cloud storage probably, for all their images and allowing downloading? 

3. Tech stack. I'm by no means a super advanced programmer, but I can pick languages up fairly well and want to kind of really dig in and work on something new. I know Java and C# fairly well. I'm not a huge front end guy, I much prefer back end stuff. So was thinking of going C#/Blazor, or Java/React and likely a SQL database as that's what I know.

I am certain copying code and slightly modifying it isnt the best way to learn at my level. Based on your experience, is it a good thing that I start by looking at these online variations to give me inspo so I can work on something similar on my own or should I work on this all by myself from scratch, is this even the best way to go about building your own projects and truly learn?

I feel I can just pass the course anyhow this semester as I can use AI for problems and I learn as much basics as I can grasp and give all my efforts. 

But will it be helpful for me once I go for other semesters where we will not only learn basics? I really love computers but this fast paced 2 years of teaching and the design is really not helping me.

I am 18 and I started everything when I got interested in HTML cause they gave us some classes at School. So learned basic HTML and CSS and found that I love building websites.  But they were just showpieces since they had no interactivity. So I started learning JS. After I learned basics of JS, I started with frameworks like React and Svelte.

I can implement a lot of basic stuff with them. But I have no clue about how they work under the hood. To me using `$state()` and `$useEffect()` is like magic. I know what they do but I don't know the underlying logic. In other words, I can ""glue"" together these things.

Today I saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61lVNkvk9AU) by Primeagen where he talks about this stuff. The syndrome is hitting pretty hard right now.

What should I do? Should I continue delving deeper into web dev or should I stop and learn something like C or Rust? Is it worth it to learn things that I hear about often that make no sense to me like linked lists, concurrency, binary tree etc.

I'm looking to learn about databases. I usally can create some level of software that is limited to my own usage and works fairly well, mostly in python but Java and C/C++ aren't too alien to me. 

What I always struggle is how to scale up to be able to share this with people. I believe nowadays the best way to do so would be through some sort of webapp/webpage. I have a few scripts/terminal based software that I could translate into a GUI and be somewhat useful for other people, the problem is these use scrapped data through sport websites APIs, so that's a lot of data. For my own use this isn't necessarily a problem if I need to wait 10/20s to run (or more). 

I imagine in order to build this kind of thing I need to know how to get and process the data, store it (this thread), make a decent GUI (I'm thinking React) and deploy it somehow (which I'd guess is probably the last thing I will need to work/learn).

So I kindly want to ask how do I learn a database, which I'm guessing is going to be something like SQL (which I know by name but I have no idea why, how and when to use it). 

Thanks in advance. ",2024-10-28 22:10:37
learnprogramming,1ge5j3c,Python: Showing Flask flash-message after using js fetch,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ge5j3c/python_showing_flask_flashmessage_after_using_js/,2,"Hello, I am currently trying out flask to create a website. Using, I'm sending a post to the back-end using JS like so:

              fetch(""/"", {
                method: ""POST"",
                headers: {

                }
              })
            });

NOTE: deltas is just some array being used to store trade info, not really relevant to question

Then in Flask, I handle the post like so:

    u/app.route(""/"", methods=[""POST"", ""GET""])
    @login_required
    def index():
    
        # If post, update db

                flash(""Your balance is too low to complete this transaction"")            
                return redirect(""/"")

Currently, the page refreshes without showing the flash message, whereas elsewhere in my program I've successfully displayed flash messages using forms. While I know JS can be used to give the user alerts, I am confused as to why a **form** results in flashed messages, but not a **JS fetch**. Any explanation would be really appreciated!

Also, I am aware that my response handling is rubbish, so any advice at that is cool too!

Thanks

I’m someone who has a degree in stem, specifically in the civil and structural engineering side of things where I’d thought I’d be set basically after graduating. I’ve landed a job and all and have been in the industry for 3 years and it’s only kind of come to me for the past year where the job itself is becoming less and less inspiring/fulfilling for me. Every project I do now starts to feel like a deadline I’m just completing but not feeling so rewarded for. In particular, the kind of projects I’m on are big industrial ones that won’t be fully built until years later so I never feel like my designs or work are really shining in front of me. 

It was a future I didn’t want for myself and so started looking elsewhere whether it be another company or another career and I’ve landed into the idea of transitioning into learning how to program and entering a developer. I’ve seen there’s a lot of routes such as going into UI/UX, data, cloud, DevOps etc. At the heart of it all, problem solving is something that I’ve enjoyed doing. I also enjoy doing things that I’m good at and training up to learn coding languages, combining and applying them for practical use sounds great to me as I can have a bit more creativity with it. It’s something where the products or services provided are more tangible than me writing my reports and drawings for structures that I don’t see get constructed or will visit as they’re always abroad. 

I’m just looking for some advice as to how I can obtain this goal as I’m willing to take time off and commit to learning. I’ve seen a lot of people take self taught, bootcamps, online courses etc. and I understand everyone has their own journey, I’m just wondering if there’s any route I should lean towards as someone who is willing to spend the time and money (if needed) to effectively learn the craft.",2024-10-29 01:14:46

I have heard people on YouTube say that making complicated list comprehensions will make other people in your job hate you. They never specified how complicated though, so here I am! Help is much appreciated, thank you!

**Suggestion 2: Forget list comprehension. Focus on efficiency by iterating over the list only one time.**

So I am thinking what should I do because if I were to choose the jobs which require me to travel too much then it means I will not have time to learn new things or if the pay is too low it will demotivate me to continue working

There are different components like order tracking, payment, catalogues management etc. All of these can be broken down in logical micro services.

The main question where I was stuck is that: what's a better approach

A. If I have Go, FastAPI and node server then I listen to all the http calls of all the services on one GO server and then full fill those requests by calling Kafka topics on python and mongo components.

B. I have all services running on different servers like request to a fastapi component directly listened by fastapi server and not coming Go server.

Since Kafka brings better reliability and all components are tightly couples I was inclining towards this solution.

The problem is I keep getting response code 4 (Token empty) after a token reset (network activity below). This usually happens when questions of any difficulty are loaded, then the token reset and questions of some specific difficulty loaded (probably because some questions of that difficulty were in the original list).

I have tried requesting a new token instead of resetting it, but I keep getting the same token??? When I make requests for a new token through my browser I receive different tokens, as it should be. I originally used OpenTriviaDB but I needed IDs so I switched. Everything worked fine with OpenTriviaDB and they both seem to be using the same token mechanism. Can it be that the API is broken?

Answer: When running with 3.7, it uses Pillow version 9.5, which has self.mode as a class variable of the Image class. This means doing `self.mode = ""blah""` just works, hence no error when running with 3.7. 3.12 uses Pillow 11.0, which now has the class variable self._mode and self.mode is now a @property which encapsulates self._mode. My second code example matched the 3.12 Pillow, causing the 3.7 output to differ

---

I'm working through an issue that I believe stems from a difference when running a script with 3.12 instead of 3.7. So I made two sandbox programs to verify this. The original error was something like: `AttributeError: property 'mode' of 'SomeClass' object has no setter`

The issue stems from some code that uses PIL and ImageFile.ImageFile. So I made a trimmed down version of that class to recreate the error:



    from PIL import Image, ImageFile

    class MyImageFile(ImageFile.ImageFile):
        format = ""BMP+Alpha""
        format_description = ""BMP with full alpha channel""

        def _open(self):
            self._read_bitmap(1)

        def _read_bitmap(self, offset):
            self.mode = ""RGBA""
            pass

    Image.register_open(MyImageFile.format, MyImageFile)
    Image.register_extension(MyImageFile.format, "".bmp"")

    img = Image.open(""sample1.bmp"")


As expected, when running this with `py -3.12`, I get `AttributeError: property 'mode' of 'MyImageFile' object has no setter`. I understand why this happens, as the superclass ImageFile.ImageFile inherits from Image.Image, which has a @property self.mode, which encapsulates self._mode, which means there's only a getter but no setter. Cool, makes sense.

When running with `py -3.7`, there's no issues, which confirmed my hunch (which was: for some reason, 3.12 throws an error for this behavior, but 3.7 doesn't; so the original issue is due to upgrading from 3.12). This is what I wanted to dive into further: Why does this happen? What exactly changed between 3.7 and 3.12 regarding this sort of code? But this isn't what I'm asking about with this post.

What's curious is when I use only my own classes to recreate the issue:

    class SuperClass():
        def __init__(self):
            self._mode = ""hello""

        @property
        def mode(self):
            return self._mode


    class Foo(SuperClass):
        def public_func(self):
            self.func()
        def func(self):
            self.mode = ""apple""


    f = Foo()
    f.public_func()


I believe this is the same structure as the initial code, just without using PIL at all; rather I make my own SuperClass (which has the relevant structure from Image.Image, etc.)

When running with `py -3.12` I get the expected error: `AttributeError: property 'mode' of 'Foo' object has no setter`.
Yet for some reason, when running with `py -3.7` I actually get an error, unlike the first example (where there was no error): `AttributeError: can't set attribute` (pointing to line 14)



I'm really confused as to why the first example outputs no error with 3.7 while the second example does. I understand the error in general; This is more of a ""what's happening under the hood"" kind of question.",2024-10-28 13:14:24

I find it a bit bad in Python that even if you use Cryptography the variables are often not overwritable and can be left in scope for way to long and even \`del var\` doesn't get rid of it.

I made a concept I call ""BlackBox"" that aims to solve this in my Package.

It works by first pairing to a receiver that gives the BlackBox a Public Key and an encryption function. The receiver deletes the Public Key for itself afterwards. Everyone can put stuff into the BlackBox, which gets encrypted and can only be decrypted by the receiver.

The BlackBox is a swap protected area of memory. I also try to make it so that methods support the BlackBox natively so secrets aren't

Function->Script->BlackBox->Receiver (Can stay in scope)

but

Function->BlackBox->Receiver (Should be marked for garbage collection right after).

The BlackBox also doesn't know it's receiver and the other way around. So if someone were to infiltrate the system I think they would have a harder time to get anything from the BlackBox.

This is just a concept, if there are bettter ways to achive that secrets are exposed for the least amount of time possible. Also if you know security programming resources please recommend them :)",2024-10-28 07:14:11

Now, regarding the GDP of the states involved:

1. \*\*Gujarat\*\*: The GDP of Gujarat for 2023 is estimated to be around ₹2.96 lakh crore (approximately $36 billion) based on the budget analysis for 2023-24. \[Source\](https://prsindia.org/budgets/states/gujarat-budget-analysis-2023-24).

\### Combined GDP of Gujarat and Maharashtra:  
\- Gujarat: ₹2.96 lakh crore  
\- Maharashtra: ₹42.67 trillion

To combine these figures:  
\- Convert Gujarat's GDP to the same unit as Maharashtra's: ₹2.96 lakh crore = ₹2.96 trillion.  
\- Combined GDP = ₹2.96 trillion + ₹42.67 trillion = ₹45.63 trillion (approximately $550 billion).

Thus, the combined GDP of Gujarat and Maharashtra is approximately \*\*₹45.63 trillion\*\* (or about \*\*$550 billion\*\*).

I have a question on how to make a clock with a custom time.
My mother loves to play Palia and she would really love to have a widget or extra clock to monitor the in game time. I already did some research but I can't find how to make this.
The in game time goes as following; one day in game is 1hr in real time. When it's 6pm in game it's 1:45, 2:45,.. in real time.
Can someone help me making this or provide me with a tutorial it would make me and my mom very happy

Also sorry for the bad grammar",2024-10-27 23:54:05

It's been pretty smooth so far, but some lessons just seem so difficult to understand. Some sentences trying to explain the code just completely blur together, using only programming terms. It feels like I am just reading ""The method changes the variable in the private class which can't access the static object in the memory address"". Now it doesn't say exactly that, but maybe the idea is there? It's hard to explain exactly. Are there any websites or tools you can recommend to a beginner that maybe does a better job at explaining stuff? Thanks for the help!",2024-10-28 03:00:06

it seems related to the maplotlib show() function and a Figure Canvas not being interactive? Don't know what that means.

I implemented a route called `/echo/` which sends back whatever you put after it in response. So my question is that when we implement a backend, let's say using Spring Boot framework with JBoss web server(It can be anything like Apache httpd or some other server); how does the JBoss server knows what to do with something like `/search?q=cats`. Or how does the Spring framework tell JBoss, what to do with it? We just do the routing in whatever framework we are using. But the one who handles requests is the server. So it has to have a way of knowing what to do with a particular route that we mapped. I just want to know a little about how it is done. If it isn't too complicated, I would like to implement it in my HTTP server. Please explain it if you know anything about it. Thanks!",2024-10-27 08:54:18

learnprogramming,1gcoafi,Correct me if I'm wrong: Bootcamps seem to teach things BACKWARDS. ,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gcoafi/correct_me_if_im_wrong_bootcamps_seem_to_teach/,48,"At least mine did. I'm sitting here wondering why real ""veteran knowledge"" isn't transferred (it seems like few attempts are made) instead of babying people through things they could logic through on their own.  We step into real jobs missing all of what we need to know, and I still don't know what it was that I needed to know. That's the question I'm asking.  

A few years ago I somehow managed to get myself into an internal bootcamp-y thing for a hiring agency, which would thrust us directly into development positions at a major insurance company.  

Suffice to say that I was so overwhelmed by the realities of software engineering that I quit out of respect for the people who needed to drag me along. (The rest of my ""cohort"" seemed to at least be learning as they went, I wasn't.) Now I only screw with things as a hobby.

Real software development is generally about:  

*Understanding your buisness domain*   
At least enough to understand what the problem you're trying to solve is. Strangely, the bootcamp, which was directed towards a health insurance company specifically, did not involve learning about that buisness domain. It's a complex industry and understanding what anyone's talking about takes a long time. The company itself tried to do that, and did it in a totally insufficient way.  

*Understanding the building blocks of real software*  
This is the biggest one for me. We were taught how to build painfully basic CRUD apps in a ""monkey see, monkey do"" way.  Everyone who is successful in this industry is insistant that if you really know what you're doing, frameworks become easy as hell– even eldritch nightmares like Spring and Spring Boot, apparently. I was, supposedly, pretty good at picking up lower-level leetcode-y bullshit— that's just logic, which is a skill— but that has nothing to do whatsoever with building real software. The skill I needed was knowledge of the tech behind enterprise apps well enough, in broad strokes, to understand what the arcane sigils I was typing out were even meant to do. I did not know what I did not know, and I was helpless.  

*Understanding how code complexity is managed in the real world*  
You don't write code for you, or even for the software you're building, you write it for future employees. On the flipside, you must learn to understand code which was written for future employees (you). This has no relation to with the sort of code that actively does things, like crunching some numbers or even storing some data. This code is concerned with higher-level ideas (paradigms and design patterns n' things). Again, the issue is that I didn't even know what those higher-level ideas were, and understood not a single line of what I was looking at, most of the time. None of it seemed to *do* anything, to me— which it did, obviously. 

**TL;DR** What is it that experienced developers figure out that allows them to transfer from one project to the next (and an entirely different tech stack) with relative ease? Why is it that this high-level, ""here's the problems you always need to solve"" and here's how we solve it"" stuff isn't really taught to students? How did you get to a point where you could look at the front page of some framework's website and translate the vague shit it tells you into ""OK, I know what this does"", or to read through documentation and understand even a single word of it? Shouldn't the focus be on making sure that students can do that, instead of teaching them low-level ""here's why floats are imperfect"", ""make me a command line app that processes text and spits it back out"" stuff?

Currently, I'm building an account app, but I’m feeling a bit stuck with all the details involved. I'm hoping for advice on a clear roadmap to guide me through the setup.

# Here’s the features that I want for user registration:

1. **Email Registration:**
   * User enters first name, last name, username, email, password, and confirms password.
   * After clicking “Continue,” an email verification should be sent via SendGrid and allauth. If everything checks out, the user becomes authenticated.
2. **Phone Number Registration:**
   * Similar inputs as email registration, but instead of email, users enter their phone number.
   * After clicking “Continue,” an SMS is sent via Twilio for phone verification.
3. **Third-Party (Social Media) Registration:**
   * Users can also register through Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Here, all relevant profile data should be imported into the user account.

After setting up the Django-based registration flow, I’ll implement it with my Vite React project later on.

what I need is a solid roadmap to keep me on track and help me efficiently structure this process. If anyone has done something similar or has insights on setting up these features with Django, SendGrid, allauth, Twilio, and React, your advice would be awesome!
