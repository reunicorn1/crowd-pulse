And that flaw is, 

Space X would require 11 rockets to refill one starship in orbit for that starship in orbit carrying crew or cargo to be sent to the moon or mars. Since any starships coming to reach the same orbital velocity as a starship already in orbit has the basically burn the same amount of fuel as the first starship even if the volume of the starships fuel tanks are larger on the fuel refilling starship. Therefore meaning a starship refilled would only have 10% of the fuel required to refill the starship its docking with and the one that is heading to the moon or mars.

I’m curious to get your thoughts on using LiDAR technology for detecting space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO). We know LiDAR is already widely used on Earth for mapping and remote object detection, but could it work in space to identify and track debris?

Here are a few pros I’m considering:

* High precision for measuring distances and potentially creating 3D profiles of debris
* Can work in dark or shadowed areas since it doesn’t rely on sunlight
* Could support real-time data processing for immediate debris tracking and possibly even collision avoidance

But there are definitely challenges too:

* Range and power limitations for detecting smaller debris at a distance
* High data volume and processing needs for CubeSats or small satellites
* Potential interference in the harsh space environment

Would love to hear your thoughts on the feasibility, any existing research or missions that have tried something similar, or alternative ideas for in-situ debris detection!",2024-11-12 22:11:07

The Andromeda Galaxy(M31) is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. Lying around 2.5 million light years from Earth and is the only galaxy that is coming towards us instead of expanding away. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy are expected to collide in the next 4.5 billion years. Making the combined new Galaxy dubbed Milkdromeda Galaxy. But don't worry our Sun will be long extinguished by this time.

This was my first time trying to shoot and process in HaLRGB. Capturing the object was fun as I did it under low moonlight but the auroras and in my yard trees hindered being able to do all night shooting.  Then came the processing. This kicked my butt and crashed Pixinsight twice. After probably about 4 hours of processing I finally succeeded in fully capturing what I think is a beautiful galaxy.

Hi r/space

I’ve been reading up on the Fermi Paradox, and the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) mentions:

>Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years.[^(\[12\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#cite_note-Hart-12)

I’m not an expert, but this part makes me wonder if we’re overestimating how feasible galactic colonization really is, even for advanced civilizations. Maybe there are limitations we don’t fully understand that make it either impossible or so difficult, that it only happens in a few, smaller galaxies. Here’s a few reasons:

1. Natural Selection: Imagine a civilization trying to spread out across the galaxy. Over millions of years, natural selection could drive isolated branches to evolve in totally different ways. If parts of this civilization got separated, they’d adapt to different environments, potentially forming distinct ideologies, cultures, or even physiologies. Eventually, they might not even see themselves as the same species anymore. The idea that all these branches would still work together towards a common goal of galactic expansion, without conflict or competition, seems pretty unlikely to me. Even here on Earth, we split into different countries and nuke each other.
2. Communication: Even if colonies managed to spread throughout the galaxy, there’d still be huge challenges with communication. Given the galaxy's size, a message traveling at light speed would take 100,000 years to cross from one end to the other. This delay would make practically impossible to keep colonies connected or unified to achieve the same goal. Each colony could end up becoming its own isolated world, making galaxy-wide coordination pretty much impossible.

To get around these issues, you’d need faster-than-light (FTL) communication and travel, which would probably break causality and open up a whole new can of worms.

So maybe the true ""Great Filter"" is that galactic colonization itself is just out of reach. Maybe intelligent life exists, possibly even in abundance, but each civilization hits this same wall when it comes to spreading across an entire galaxy. They might instead focus on improving their own star system and a few nearby stars, and never manage to go much further. That could explain why we aren’t seeing signs of life out there.

I’d be curious to hear what you think about this. What are your thoughts on the Fermi Paradox? Do you think there are limits like these that could prevent civilizations from colonizing the galaxy?",2024-11-08 10:22:40

space,1gn9779,How do I get into Astronomy?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1gn9779/how_do_i_get_into_astronomy/,8,"Hi, I know this question has already been asked a million times, and I picked up some stuff from already existing posts, but most of the time advice is either sctrictly about steps to take to get a job in astronomy, or ""buy a telescope and a constellations book:)"", plus a lot of the askers are high school students and/or US citizens. None of which are my case unfortunately.

So, long story short - I'm 19 (third year of uni, the major has nothing to do with science), live in eastern europe (ukraine), miserably failed my physics, and basically failed chemistry and math when I was in high school. I'm not really expecting to change career paths, at least right now. One of the reasons is I want to take it slow and steady and see where it takes me, and only whenifwhen I build a solid foundation think further. Currently, this is more like a blazing passion I found very recently, that I hope doesn't turn out short-lived and that can be turned into something beautiful.

For some perspective I want to list the things I'm doing/planning on doing:

 -the Khan academy Cosmology and Astronomy course
- Cosmos series by Neil Tyson
- Astronomy notes by Strobel
- Cosmology for the curious by Perlov and Vilenkin

Maybe you have something nice for me to add to the list. 

Now to one of my main questions: background in highschool-level sciences. I'm sure that if I want to go past the ""ooh that's the __ star! *pointing at the sky* pretty."" level I NEED it. Now, without the school pressure, I am perhaps starting to like this stuff. I want to do it as I'm learning about space but I'm not sure how to go about it. 
Under most posts, since the people that ask are still at school replies just say ""pay attention in your math classes"" or something along the lines. And what should I do, then? Do I literally find grade 7 chemistry, math, and physics textbooks and just go through each of them? (if yes good book recs please) Or is there a smarter and more efficient way? Do I just consume everything Khan academy has to offer regarding science courses? Or do I get to learn everything that's necessary as I'm reading those entry-level cosmology/astronomy textbooks I mentioned above?
Basically, I want to be able to learn about the hows and whys in deep, but still keep it astronomy-related as much as possible.

And for a secondary question that isn't required to be answered but I want to put it out there just in case someone has similar experience and some advice:
I mentioned that I live Ukraine, is it possible to just completely avoid sources in my native language? Is there a point in doing that? Even if, and that's a huge if, I seek higher education in astronomy, it won't be in Ukraine in Ukrainian, I don't want it to be. Plus I just looked it up, I don't think my city has any active clubs or stuff like that, so I won't even be able to take this hobby outside haha, except for maybe a pair of binoculars.
 So I think me keeping the learning sources strictly in English shouldn't be a problem, especially considering how little I know about astrology and space, I already know more of it in English rather than Ukrainian/Russian. But I wouldnt mind hearing other people's perspective who are also from non-english speaking countries.",2024-11-09 12:37:59

I know we typically talk about things through frames of reference and relativity, but if movement through time is affected by velocity through space, then surely you can bring the absolute velocity to zero. 

Take this experiment: Go into space with a friend (ignore the biology and all logistical issues) with an atomic clock each. Set yourselves in motion in a random direction.

After a certain amount of time, one person's clock will have ticked more than the other because that person is moving faster through space relative to space itself. You can experiment with different directions to reduce the time dilation differential, eventually to zero. At the point where any individual's change would only slow down time for them, you know you're at zero velocity. 

Given this logic, there must be a universal frame of reference. Velocity of zero relative to the universe itself. Though I suppose this is complicated by the fact that the universe itself is expanding and I don't know how that factors in.",2024-11-08 06:15:23

I am having trouble narrowing down a major. I am well aware that I do not have to declare my major immediately, but time does fly by so I would like to be thinking of it. Like many, I have always had the dream of studying space for a living.

Currently, I have narrowed it down to some sort of engineering, maybe mechanical engineering. My thought behind that is that if I major in mechanical engineering and possibly don't make it to the point where I can study space (e.g. NASA, Space X, etc...), then my degree is highly versitile and will allow me to still get a well paying job in the end. However, I can't seem to stop toying with the idea of astrophysics, or astronomy, or cosmology, as THAT is where my true heart lies. However, it seems to me that getting a job with those degrees are limited meaning if I am not able to get into the space industry, would I just be screwed?

I guess the ultimate question I am asking is: Is it wise to still follow my heart into astrophysics and such while risking the job market being small? Or just go into engineering with the hopes of space research but a larger job market to fall back on?",2024-11-07 22:59:27

space,1gmfln3,A Coherent Synthesis of Explanations for Fermi Paradox,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1gmfln3/a_coherent_synthesis_of_explanations_for_fermi/,25,"There are a lot of explanations for Fermi Paradox, and I think some of them together caused the phenomena we saw, so I synthesized some of them into a coherent narrative below. In short, life is abundant, life to intelligence is the first great filter coming from randomness in evolutioin (so it takes time and space), but some civilization will occur and they all go extinct at certain point by themselves or when they meet others and don't get along with each other, and if they do survive, they as a whole enter into next level of arena, where the game repeats. Moreover, the high level intelligence remain stealthy to lower ones for safety reasons.

The universe has existed for about 14 billion years. Several generations of stars have burned and exploded, scattering enough metals into the interstellar medium to form life. The Milky Way galaxy was formed slightly later, around 13.6 billion years ago. About 4.6 billion years ago, a dense region within the Orion Arm's interstellar cloud collapsed under gravity, igniting the Sun, with the remaining matter forming the planets that orbit it. Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago, took several hundred million years to cool, and stabilize its orbit. Primitive life appeared between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago and began to evolve. Humans appeared roughly 5 million years ago. Civilization began with the use of tools and technology, with primitive stone tools being used about a million years ago, the emergence of language around 200,000 years ago, and ancient civilizations forming about 6,000 years ago.

The evolutionary history of life on Earth can offer insights into the timescales of civilizations in the universe. Although life can form under different conditions, there are common factors, such as the need for macromolecular substances capable of forming complex structures, and a solvent to facilitate material exchange with the environment. The approximately 100 elements in the universe formed gradually, with heavier elements being rarer, and the most abundant elements are several orders of magnitude more common than the less abundant ones. Considering the chemical properties of elements, organic macromolecules with carbon chains and water are the most likely forms for life to appear (in the first place).

I believe that life is widespread in the universe. Given a suitable star and the right elements on a planet in the habitable zone, amino acids can gradually synthesize, and over billions of years, evolve into life with universal fundamentals but specific forms. Life formation requires certain conditions and sufficient time; these requirements may seem stringent, but they are relatively simple for the universe with abundant space and time. The first Great Filter happens at the transition from life to intelligence. Life evolves through natural selection and random mutations. We can think of the evolutionary arena as a plateau with peaks and valleys. Animals randomly move in different directions over time, leading them to ascend or descend certain peaks. Occasionally, tides come in and eliminate all animals below a certain height, and such a cycle repeats. Eventually, the system stabilizes, with each animal(s) occupying a peak where they have reached an optimal local solution (ecological niche), leaving no room for further ascent. There may be higher peaks elsewhere, but reaching them requires animals to abandon their current advantageous form, descend into a valley, and risk being wiped out by the tides. This explains why evolution is slow, as species in stable environments evolve into their corresponding ecological niches, where their form is the optimal solution for survival as long as the environment remains stable. Over billions of years, life has undergone this repeated evolutionary process. Finally, around 2 million years ago, climate changes led to the aridification of East Africa, causing widespread vegetation die-offs, forcing a group of ancient apes to descend from the trees and walk upright on two legs in search of a new home.

The second Great Filter, and possibly the one we are currently facing, is the leap from mastering technology to entering interstellar space. ""A galaxy is about 100,000 light-years across. At 1% of the speed of light, a civilization or self-replicating machine could cross it in 10 million years. Why is the universe still empty?"" This is a form of question posed by the Fermi Paradox. With a sense of civilization's time scale, it becomes easier to explain. The timescale for civilization formation is about a million years, but once a civilization begins developing science and technology, this timescale compresses to a century, and technological progress will only further compress a civilization's timescale. The more advanced a civilization is, the longer a hundred years will seem, let alone a thousand or million years. Therefore, the idea of slowly colonizing the galaxy at a snail's pace is implausible. The purpose of expanding beyond the solar system is because local resources can no longer meet the civilization's needs, which means that this civilization could use sufficient resources within the galaxy and has mastered technology several eras beyond the atomic age, but before that, it is very likely to self-destruct. Although, for some reason, it is not impossible for a civilization with a timescale of a few decades to spend a thousand years reaching a target 100 light-years away, considering the first Great Filter and the nature of such behavior, the probability of it happening becomes very low, and more unlikely actions will only further reduce its occurrence. The universe is vast but still finite, and when the probability of an event becomes too small, even if it is theoretically possible, it may never happen in the entire history of the universe or its distant future. Therefore, the Milky Way may have many planets with life, some of which might have developed intelligent civilizations, but they are all trapped locally. In the entire universe, other galaxies might be similar, with some even producing one or several interstellar civilizations that may have encountered and communicated with each other. Beyond that, perhaps every few thousand galaxies that have birthed interstellar civilizations could produce one that develops into an intergalactic civilization traversing its galaxy cluster at near-light speed. Each possible scenario above reduces the probability by an order of magnitude or more. The evolution of civilization is the evolution of technology, and the use of technology carries risks. The more advanced the technology, the more a civilization can impact its environment and leave a mark on the universe, but when they fall, the greater the destruction that technology can cause. So, one explanation for the Fermi Paradox is that the universe is vast, life, intelligence, and even more advanced civilizations may appear, but with each step forward in technology, the probability sieve makes the most influential civilizations increasingly rare. The distribution of civilizations in the universe resembles Gabriel's Horn, with an infinitely large base and a rapidly narrowing top. The curve of this horn is not smooth, with abrupt contractions representing the Great Filters. The first Great Filter is natural and not caused by humans, arising from the randomness in the process of natural selection. After that, each Great Filter is the same, all human-caused, and all due to one reason: intelligent individuals meet, interact, develop together until one day, they mutually annihilate each other. Of course, if fortunate, they can avoid this bad outcome, sustain a larger collective through certain means, and step into a bigger universe as a complete and harmonious entity. They could enter their galaxy group (about 10 million light-years), their local supercluster (100 million light-years), their supercluster (1 billion light-years), and structures so large they defy description. At the highest levels of the horn, there may have been only a few, a dozen, or perhaps more of these civilizations in the entire universe. But no matter how many, curiosity rather than the survival instinct drives them to explore the broader universe, to experience the most intense and lively aspects of the universe, to witness the formation of supermassive black holes, to observe neutron star mergers up close, to explore the deepest mysteries of the universe, and to understand reality itself. During their journey, they might have seen countless civilizations still confined within their solar systems, halted before the second Great Filter, and the destruction of these civilizations often took with them the life on their planets that had taken billions of years to evolve, extinguishing any hope of starting over. They would not attempt to intervene, but unlike our indifference to the struggles of ants, these civilizations, like them, possess intelligence and free will, filled with curiosity about the same universe, longing to explore broader horizons. Their choice not to intervene is not out of coldness or indifference, but because these civilizations, which have yet to pass the test, are internally divided, distrustful of each other, unable to form true unity and harmony. To these advanced civilizations, those that fail to pass the test are dangerous. More advanced technology will only lead these immature civilizations to expand their distrust and conflict in dangerous ways. If such civilizations fail to overcome their internal contradictions and violent tendencies during their evolutionary process, even with more powerful technology, they will only exacerbate their self-destructive tendencies, and they might even bring this destructiveness to a wider universe. In extremely rare cases, perhaps out of pity, they might leave a barely perceptible ripple in space-time, pulling back a pure-hearted civilization on the brink of destruction due to an accident.

The journey continues, and they are lonely as individuals. They want to know if there are others like them in the universe. They look forward to meeting other similar beings, sharing each other's history, technology, and beliefs. Over a long period, they finally encounter others, one, two, three... These civilizations begin to contact each other, carefully exchange, learn from each other, and develop together.

Humans have come a long way from a million years ago to today. Using the imagined community and agreements, we have gradually incorporated more people into larger structures, experiencing hardships and setbacks along the way but ultimately succeeding. The current largest structure is the nation-state, built through beliefs, ethnicity, and constitutions. Throughout history, technological progress has prompted more people to meet earlier, forcing people in different structures without mutual benefits to resort to traditional solutions from their ancestors, war. In the 15th century, the maturity of ocean navigation technology led to the Age of Discovery, followed by centuries of bloody progress. In modern times, relative stability was achieved through mutual benefits brought by trade. However, ethnicity, nations, and the so-called glory that comes with them are still the largest binding concepts that humans can truly understand and grasp, leading to World War I and World War II. The most advanced technologies were brought to the battlefield, tearing hundreds of thousands of people to shreds in batches, and resources far surpassing those invested in science during peacetime were poured to develop the most effective killing weapons. In the end, after that war to end all wars, nuclear weapons, the most destructive technology ever mastered by humanity, were born before any larger structure could emerge. Civilization will not realize its predicament; it will not stop moving forward and will continue its progress. The development of communication technology brought the internet, and within a few decades, people across the entire globe were drawn into the same community. People began to curiously communicate with others on the opposite side of the Earth, sharing views and cultures, and promoting mutual learning. From nature and nurture, people are different from one another, and so are the nations they form. In the past, to unite, people established stable collectives through nations, sharing a history and culture that made them proud. But when nations meet, the legacies that people cherish from history become a burden. To unite more people together, it was necessary albeit unrealistic, in effect, to first remove the tools that bound them to a particular group, while simultaneously creating a new tool to bring all those who have been freed from their bonds together again and start developing anew. This echoes the previously mentioned plateau of evolution, where, to break free from a local optimum and continue progressing, one must first pause, or even regress during trial and error, descending into a valley before climbing again. The term ""global human community"" has existed for a long time, but like many other terms that refer to ideals that people aspire to but have yet to realize, people still carry the weight of history and do not know how to achieve them. This is because the immediate problems to consider are already overwhelming compared to distant goals. But civilization is unaware of this, and technology will continue to progress. Two samples are not enough to predict whether the scale of total war will cause greater destruction with further technological advancement. Precision strikes may achieve objectives while curbing casualties. But aside from these, black swan events like the Cuban Missile Crisis will not be the last. In the coming centuries, more technologies will emerge. Humanity can win countless times, but Death only needs to get lucky once. This could also be a reason for incentivizing humanity to step into space sooner, to spread to other planets.",2024-11-08 10:35:49

Dark energy is the mysterious force believed to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe, rather than the slowing down that we might expect due to gravity.

An intellectually fascinating aspect of dark energy is its **equation of state**, which is tied to the **cosmological constant** Λ, but we don’t fully understand what dark energy is or why it has the effect it does on the universe. We can express this influence mathematically using Einstein’s **general theory of relativity** in the form:

**Gμν + Λgμν = 8πGTμν**

Where:

* **Gμν** is the Einstein tensor, describing the geometry of spacetime.
* **Λ** is the cosmological constant, related to dark energy.
* **gμν** is the metric tensor, describing the structure of spacetime.
* **Tμν** is the stress-energy tensor, representing the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime.
* **G** is the gravitational constant.
* **π** is the mathematical constant Pi.

“With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,” said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University.",2024-11-05 11:26:11

For those invested in space exploration and NASA's future, there’s a silver lining to this outcome: the Artemis program—NASA’s ambitious effort to return astronauts to the Moon and lay the groundwork for Mars missions—will likely receive renewed support. Trump was a key advocate for Artemis during his first term, and his administration laid the groundwork for the program's ambitious lunar goals, which Biden’s administration upheld but at times struggled to prioritize due to competing interests. 

While it’s a relief that Artemis has a chance to proceed, some, myself included, are grateful that former NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, a well-known figure from previous administrations, won’t likely take the helm at NASA. Garver has been vocal about shifting NASA’s focus toward commercial partnerships over direct lunar exploration—a perspective that doesn’t align with the traditional goals of NASA's human spaceflight division. Under a Trump administration, NASA leadership will likely focus more intently on pushing Artemis forward without dramatic shifts in policy direction. 

Trump’s potential appointees for NASA Administrator are likely to continue emphasizing the human return to the Moon and the need for sustained lunar infrastructure. Candidates like Greg Autry and Robert Walker, who have been involved with Trump's space policy, are strong possibilities. They bring experience and enthusiasm for space exploration, which will be crucial as the U.S. faces increasing competition, especially from China, which has its lunar ambitions. 

Though mixed feelings about the election outcome remain, there’s at least a sense of optimism for NASA’s continued drive toward its Moon and Mars goals. Artemis, despite its delays, is a program worthy of America’s support, and it now stands a better chance of receiving the focus and funding it needs to succeed in the coming years.

I’ve recently developed a basic tool called ICBM Simulator, and I wanted to share it with the community. This open-source simulator lets you explore the trajectories of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) from a scientific perspective.

About the Tool:

The simulator is straightforward—it allows you to input some basic launch parameters and see how an ICBM might travel through the atmosphere and along its trajectory. While it’s not highly advanced, it’s a solid starting point for anyone interested in the basic science behind missile trajectories.

What You Can Do:

* Basic Trajectory Simulation: Visualize the missile’s flight path based on simple input parameters.
* Impact Estimation: Get a rough idea of where the missile might land based on the trajectory.
* Educational Purpose: This tool is purely for scientific curiosity and learning about missile trajectories.

Why I Made It:

I created this simulator to help people understand the fundamentals of missile trajectories without getting too technical. Whether you’re a student, educator, or just curious about how these things work, I hope you find it interesting.

Open Source & Feedback Welcome:

The project is fully open source, so anyone interested in contributing, exploring, or modifying it is welcome to do so. Check out the source code on GitHub: [ICBM Simulator on GitHub](https://github.com/dimitarbez/ICBMSimulator). I’m still working on improvements, so I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions! If you have ideas for making it more useful or educational, please let me know.

\--- 1957: A dog named Laika became the first living creature to orbit the Earth as the Soviets launched Sputnik 2. The capability of returning a capsule safely to Earth had not yet been developed. This was a one-way mission. Laika died long before she ran out of oxygen because the loss of the heat shield made the temperature in the capsule rise to unsafe levels. Due to falsified records by the Soviets at the time, it is unclear how long Laika lived. But it is agreed that she did orbit the earth at least several times.

\--- ***""The Space Race"".*** That is the title of one of the episodes of my podcast: ***History Analyzed***. In 1961, [President ]()John F. Kennedy famously promised to land a man on the moon within one decade, but why was there a race to the moon anyway? Get your questions about the space race answered and discover little known facts.

The closest major galaxy to us is Andromeda which is 2.5 million light years away from us. At Warp 9.9, it would take over 120 years to get there. Warp 1 is lightspeed, which is theoretically an unobtainable velocity in known and widely accepted science.

The fastest man-made object ever built is the Parker solar probe which is projected to go 430,000 miles an hour in December of this year.  That is incredibly fast (you could get anywhere on the planet in less than 90 seconds at that speed) but it's still less than .07% of lightspeed.

Warp 9.9 is massively fast in the Trek fictional universe, it's essentially as fast as any ship in Star Trek has ever gone. It's entirely possible that if humans are still a thing a thousand generations from now, we will not even have figured out how to travel close to lightspeed, which itself a tiny fraction (less than 1/3000th) of Warp 9.9.

So now let it sink in that at the fastest speeds our imaginations could come up with in the longest running space exploration franchise, it would still take us a couple of lifetimes to get to the nearest major Galaxy.

There are over 2 trillion galaxies in the known observable universe. 

Look but don't touch, we can never visit over 99.999% of what we see because we are forever imprisoned by the sheer enormity of it all. Congratulations, you're a human being and you get to play with all sorts of neat tech gadgets in your short lifetime, but in the grand scheme of things, you're always going to remain right where you are.

I find it incredibly humbling that all we will likely ever experience first hand is just an infinitesimally small part of the one galaxy we were born in. But at the same time it's reassuringly cool that as far as we know, for now we are the only creatures in the known universe to have imaginations evolved enough to allow us to visit any place we'd like to go.

(like getting across the Galaxy in a matter of days with a hyperdrive even though those don't seem to work as often as you need them to)

I oversee our recruiting efforts at AstroForge, and we are actively looking to scale our team. I am actively hiring, RIGHT NOW for the roles posted below. This isn't just your next job, if you're passionate about space, passionate about impact, passionate about influence, passionate about world and humanity changing technology then send me a message, or apply directly in

We recently raised a substantial Series A round, and are in the process of our second launch very early next year sending Odin, our second satellite, to deep space. Our third space vehicle is also early in development, and you would have a huge hand on making sure these missions are successful by owning some of the technology that will make it possible to bring metals back to earth from millions of miles away. This isn't just a pipe dream, as we just became the first commercial company that the FCC gave a spectrum license to allowing for deep space exploration. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'd love to chat further and tell you more!

\- Electrical Engineer

\- RF Engineer

\- DevOps Engineer

\- Embedded Software Engineer

\- Vehicle Integration Engineer -

Flight Dynamics Engineer

Each one of these roles are critical, and will have HIGH IMPACT as we are preparing for our next launch!

The search for more planets continued into this century. In 1930, an American astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh struck gold. He spotted a tiny “star” moving, which turned out to be the ninth planet, Pluto. It is so far away that it takes almost 250 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun. Currently, Pluto is not the most distant planet, as its orbit partially crosses within Neptune’s orbit (until 1999).

We don’t know much about Pluto. It is so distant that it only appears as a dot in telescopes, and no space probes have yet visited it.

Pluto is a very small world, the smallest planet by far—even smaller than the Moon. It has its own moon, Charon. Interestingly, Charon is quite large compared to Pluto, leading astronomers to often refer to Pluto/Charon as a double planet.

[Image: The first clear image of Pluto and Charon, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990]

Planet X

After the discovery of Pluto, astronomers were reluctant to believe it was the last planet. It was far too small to cause the perturbations observed in Uranus and Neptune’s orbits. They assumed there must be a tenth planet, Planet X. However, later calculations were able to explain all the movements within the solar system without needing to refer to a tenth planet. And that’s where the matter stands today.

Pluto’s Specifications:
•	Equatorial diameter: 2,284 km
	•	Mass (compared to Earth): 0.002
	•	Volume (compared to Earth): 0.005
	•	Density (compared to water): 2
	•	Distance from the Sun: 5.9 billion km
	•	Orbital period around the Sun: 247 years and 8 months
	•	Rotation period: 6 days and 9 hours
	•	Average temperature: -230°C

[Image: An illustration of Pluto’s orbit, which takes it far above and below the other planets’ orbits]

Planet Hunters

After the discovery of Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846, it became clear these planets did not follow their “timetables” precisely. This sparked the hunt for a ninth planet that might be causing these disturbances.

In the early 1900s, American astronomer Percival Lowell calculated where the new planet would be located: somewhere within the constellations Gemini or Taurus. He began searching for it but in vain. Lowell passed away in 1916.

A young astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh continued Lowell’s work at his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. He began searching for the new planet in 1927.

On February 9, 1930, he examined the two images below, taken on January 23 and January 27. A “star” had moved. It was not a star but the new planet, Pluto. It was not far from where Lowell had predicted.

Pluto’s Specifications:

	•	Mass (compared to Earth): 0.002
	•	Volume (compared to Earth): 0.005
	•	Density (compared to water): 2
	•	Distance from the Sun: 5.9 billion km
	•	Orbital period around the Sun: 247 years and 8 months
	•	Rotation period: 6 days and 9 hours
	•	Average temperature: -230°C

Structure

	•	Rocky core?
	•	Water/methane ice

Moons

	•	1 (Charon)

If you’re in deep space burning straight for days the ship and its passengers are moving at a high rate of speed. You cut of the engines, the passengers and the ships inertia has been synced, they’re moving in the same direction at the same speed. At this point if you rotate the ship 90° and flip the engines back on anything not strapped down falls in arc toward a wall at the side of the ship because you’ve applied lateral force to forward momentum. Everything that hit the wall will then slide down back to the floor as the new thrust vector normalizes the inertial direction.

Is this correct?

You’re in an empty train car with a tennis ball. Put the ball in the center of the car while the train is stopped, it won’t move. Accelerate the train and the ball will roll to the back wall, bring the train to a stop and the ball rolls to the front wall. Now get the train up to 40mph constant speed. You, the ball and the train have matched inertia, putting the ball down will again result in it not rolling anywhere. Now set the train on a 90° turn, the ball rolls in an arc toward the wall opposite the direction the train is turning until it hits the side wall.

Is this the same thing as the space ship example?",2024-10-24 16:19:59

And growing up has also massively expanded not only my interest, but my knowledge in space.

But in the recent months, ive genuinely been considering becoming an astronaut and have been wondering what it would take to become one. Im still relatively young (15 years old) but I genuinely locked in to attempt to become an astronaut. I understand that its incredibly difficult, ive looked at all of the numbers (0.07% blew my mind) but I always thought that the least I could do was give it a try, I just need to know from people knowledgeable in recruitment and just, have knowledge or information in the things I can do to become an astronaut.

My plan for my older years is pretty straightforward, which is trying to become an ER Physicist or spending time as a pilot in the air force (or a flight surgeon). My grades are a bit low (im averaging around an 85% in all my courses which I am not very proud of), other than that I don't really know what else I should do, can any of you give me any tips or tell me what I should do in my future years?",2024-10-23 22:54:40

How difficult would it eventually get to not have to worry about space junk affecting active launches?

Does anyone know of interesting things for this project? My knowledge is very limited and i can't find a place to start this search, the NASA image server for example works with entering a search prompt but that's not that easy when you literally have no idea what to search for..
But it doesn't have to be from NASA, any Space program works as long as i can prove by a publication that the object has been in space before.

any life that formed on mars would confirm that life may come about on planets that are earth like, something we already kinda assume true. Any martian life probably evolved when the planet had surface water and if still alive today, we would be seeing the last remnants of it, a hold out living in the martian soil that still evolved from a very similar origin to that on earth. but even then, there is a chance that they are not truly alien and instead life found itself launched into space and found itself on our neighbor, or perhaps even vice versa in the billions of years that have been. It would be fascinating to see of course, but what finding life on europa would truly mean, i feel is 100,000x greater in value and normies do not seem to appreciate this enough imo.

Any life found inside of europa would truly be alien, it would have completely formed and evolved independently from earth life, in a radically different environment, in a radically different part in space, it being a moon over jupiter. and for 2 forms of life to come about so radically different in the same solar system would strongly suggest the universe is teeming with life wherever there is water. And we see exoplanets similar to jupiter almost everywhere we look, hell we have 4 gas giants in our own solar system, with even more subserface oceans moons, our own solar system could have be teeming with life this whole time!

Europan’ life would teach us a lot about the nature of life and its limits. Depending on its similarity to earth life chemistry, it would tell us just how different life chemistry can be, if it's super similar in such a different place, it would suggest that perhaps the way abiogenesis can happen is very restricted at least for water based life, meaning all life in the universe (that isn't silicon based or whatever) could be more similar than different at a cellular scale. Finding life/ former life on Mars that is similar to earth life would only suggest that the type of life we are, is what evolution seems to prefer for terrestrial planets with surface water. 

I could keep going on, but i think you guys get the point, at least i hope you do, it is late and i hope this isn't a schizophrenic ramble, but the key point is, by having a form of life to come from something so different from what we know, it very well could change how we see the universe far more than finding any form of life on mars, and i think its sad that normal people ( who are not giant nerds like us)  are more hyped for mars. anyway here is some cool jupiter art i found

space,1g55dfy,EPQ help needed about aerospace medicine on future space travel,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1g55dfy/epq_help_needed_about_aerospace_medicine_on/,2,"Hi, I'm a Year 12 student who got accepted to do an EPQ, and I need help formulating a question.

For context, an EPQ is basically a mini dissertation based on a question of your own choosing. The question has to be focussed, evaluative, researchable and interesting. My main issue is having my question be focussed and evaluative: having it be large enough to fit a recommended 6000 word count but small enough to be explored in a lot of depth and also being evaluative as to leave some room for counterarguments (not being able to be answered in a simple ""yes"" or ""no"").

My general topic is aerospace medicine which explores medicine and physiology in the abnormal environment of high altitude; Space medicine is a sector of aerospace medicine which is self-explanatory. I have always been fascinated by the way our body deals with extreme environments and aerospace medicine, which I cannot believe more people don't know about, is a field which I aspire to explore in the future. So I first got interested when I learned about the Artemis mission and was beginning to wonder about the importance of medicine in establishing a long-term presence of the moon and beyond (as you can see, I had decided to go into medicine long beforehand).

I have done quite a lot of research before my EPQ even started, and to me, space medicine can largely be subdivided into four main topics: Microgravity, Radiation, Pressure and Isolation. 

Microgravity (you know when astronauts are like floating in the air in those videos on the ISS -- that's microgravity) affects how fluids move in the body which can increase pressure on the eye, causing problems in vision and leads to bone atrophy in muscles as they waste away without the force of gravity to keep them in check.

Ionising radiation is omnipresent in space and massively dangerous for astronauts (imagine their cells being hit by bursts of energy like shotgun blasts that can damage the structure of their DNA) and this effect accumulates the longer your in space leading to increased risk of cancer and more chronic conditions.



Pressure is probably the danger which humans have mitigated the most through innovative countermeasures in engineering. The main dangers of pressure come in the form of decompression sickness where nitrogen gases form bubbles in our bloodstream due to rapid decreases in pressure. Imagine the energy you see when you open the lid of a boiling kettle but instead of a kettle, its an astronaut, and instead of opening a lid, they're climbing out their high pressurised spacecraft to do a spacewalk. Another point to mention is ebullism - where blood can literally boil as water decreases in boiling point with increased pressure - but I haven't really researched that tbf so I can't comment on that too much. By the way, all this can happen to you if you're a scuba diver or a passenger on a plane or hiking up a mountain. Altitude is dangerous.

If this all sounds scary to you, it should be worth mentioning that engineers, doctors and scientists have found countermeasures to ensure astronauts, plane riders, scuba divers and hikers don't literally spontaneously combust or suffocate through pressurised cabins and suits, bottled o2, making sure to ascend slowly in water (in the case of scuba divers) and having astronauts arrange their bodies in such a way when they blast off, such that blood does not pool to the bottom of their legs.



Finally, imagine that you're an astronaut on a mission to Mars, which will take at minimum six months to reach, in a tiny, compact spacecraft with a limited number of people on board, and to top it all of, you can't talk to your friends or family as there is a message delay of about 20 mins depending on how far you have travelled. Your destination is a desolate, freezing planet with, to our knowledge, no life present. If you're still still with me, you should imagine that an extremely isolating journey ahead.

Isolation will have a psychological impact on the people who make it to space, and Mars, and this is why NASA hires astronauts based not only on expertise, but on personality and ability to get along with others. Future space travel will depend not only on the way we take care of physical health of our astronauts, but also their mental health. This is why having a medical professional on board will be vital for long-term space missions as if a medical emergency happens on board or on a distant planet, mission control can't help you: it's all on you

  
This explanation and overview is much too simplified and doesn't cover the many compounding problems that plague future space travel however it should give you a general idea of what I want to tackle in my EPQ (If I made any mistakes, feel free to tell me in the comments). As you can see, the topics covered in space medicine are very broad, and it's hard to imagine explaining all of them in-depth in a short 6000ish word essay. Furthermore, I can't imagine a satisfying question which will allow room for exploration of different sides and counterarguments. 

ChatGPT gives some interesting answers given the prompt ""give me an evaluative, focussed, interesting and researchable EPQ question based on my topic of aerospace medicine and my interests in space colonisation and the Artemis program and establishing long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars"":

  
- ""To what extent are current advancements in aerospace medicine sufficient to support the long-term health of astronauts in lunar and Martian colonies""

- ""What medical advancements are necessary to ensure the survival of astronauts on long-term space missions""

  
These questions are interesting, but I'm unsure on how to actually answer them. Really, I also want feedback from actual people instead of a robot. My supervisor and friends find it hard to suggest question ideas to me as they don't know that much about the topic which is why I sought help here.

space,1g54ksi,Mass influx model for satellite mega-constellations based on Monte Carlo simulations,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1g54ksi/mass_influx_model_for_satellite/,1,"Hi all! I am working on a mass influx model that will predict the amount of mass (satellites plus rocket bodies) that re-enters the earth based on the growth of mega-constellations such as Starlink. It's important to predict this because when satellites re-enter, they burn up and release a lot of pollutants in the atmosphere. For example, the re-entry process releases a lot of aluminium and nitrogen which destroys the ozone layer. Now, I have chosen to use the Monte Carlo simulation approach as it seems best for a stochastic process like this. Not all constellations will be initiated and the ones that do begin won't reach full constellation completion. There's a lot of uncertainty and variables that need to be taken into account to properly predict the mass influx with a reasonable amount of confidence. Hence why I have chosen the Monte Carlo simulation.

Now I am facing some problem in order to implement this. I have developed a more enhanced methodology based on Schulz and Glassmeier (2021), but I am still facing a problem. Currently I have developed an algorithm (more like logic) in order to assess the mass influx time series from a single constellation based on specific parameters like operational period, lifespan of each satellite and planned operational size. I have constrained the growth so graphically the constellation size over time is looks like a plateau. According to that, the mass influx is determined (which included rocket bodies and failures and replacements). Now I am having trouble randomising it, cumulating it (from a bunch of constellations) and making sense of the data (since I am not using any input distributions). Can somebody please help me with it? I am going to be publishing it on Github so any work will definitely be credited. Thanks",2024-10-16 17:11:11

Let us assume that the existence of a subsurface ocean is confirmed (by the Clipper, or the ESA mission). What technological advance and/or engineering achievement would be needed in order to directly sample the ocean? 

Edit: By “sample the ocean” I mean a lander that drills down the entire ice layer and deploys a submersible robotic craft (or at least an instrument) directly into the ocean: which can then directly sample / scan the ocean for existence of life.
