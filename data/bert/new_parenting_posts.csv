My son says anytime this child was annoyed at my son for doing or saying something he didn’t like, he would grab him or hit him in the private area. I’m so surprised at hearing about this so late but also how do we go about this situation? The teacher said she was going to speak with the parents and file a report but I feel that they need to be separated. What would you do? Are they still too little or old enough to know better?

parenting,1gq02hq,Worried for my child’s classmate ,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gq02hq/worried_for_my_childs_classmate/,45,"Synopsis: my child is friends with a little girl who routinely is sent to school without food due to her father’s opinion that she should eat less. My child is sharing her lunch, but I’m still concerned for this little girl. 

Full story: My daughter is 8, and every week tells me she shares her lunch with her friend because the friend doesn’t get sent food or enough food. 

The girl is 8, and very small for her age, so her food isn’t restricted for a health concern. It’s also not for a financial reason, the kids go to an expensive private school, and the child’s parents drive a luxury car, they also pay extra for a hot lunch twice a week. That being said, the kids are in school for 8 hours a day, on the hot lunch day, the child isn’t sent anything in her lunch. On the packed lunch days, she routinely only brings grapes and carrot sticks as her whole food for the day. 

When the child tells the teachers she’s hungry, they tell her to tell her parents to send her more food. She has talked to my daughter about it and says she asks her parents, but her dad says she needs to eat less. The child says the dad is mean to her and her mom and doesn’t like when she eats. 

I don’t mind sending extra food for the child, but also feel like I shouldn’t just leave it there, I feel sorry for the child and am considering whether I speak to the teacher or do anything further. For context, I’m based in Canada. ",2024-11-13 00:28:00

We tried HelloFresh a couple times, but the meals were never anything our daughter would touch, and decided it was a bit pricy for what it was.

We have meal planned in the past, bought groceries on the weekend for the upcoming weeks meals, and then usually by wedns or thurs we're tired of cooking ""big"" meals or some veg we bought has gone bad in the fridge, and it just sucks.

On top of that, we find that we end up making the same small handful of items on a regular basis.

How do you folks deal with figuring out what to make for dinner (or lunch, or whatever) every day, and handle those days where you just really don't want to spend an hour prepping a meal but can't afford the time or money to eat out (should have mentioned, it's 10 miles to the nearest grocery store or restaurant for us)

For context, we live in Australia and a degree of swearing is culturally normal. I however grew up in quite wa religious family where even saying butt instead of bottom was frowned upon. I have loosened up from my upbringing. My husband also grew up in a home that frowned upon swearing, however he has very much swung the other way and he swears quite a lot. 

My husband, since I’ve known him, has always sworn more than the average person, but the past couple of months his swearing has just become more and more prevalent. Given that our son is learning more words, last night while we were talking in bed and I had noticed a stream of swear words as he was talking about something that annoyed him, I gently asked if we could maybe tone down the amount of swearing in front of the kids. He is a really intelligent man and is very educated, but he enjoys swearing. When I asked if he could tone it down this really really annoyed him and he said no. 

His position is that “if I want to swear in my own fucking home, I’ll fucking swear”. In a nutshell, he felt that I was trying to control the way he speaks in the safety of our home and swearing for him is a satisfying way of expressing how he might be feeling. 

But for me, I’m worried about our children picking up these words and using them at the wrong time. I don’t want my son ostracised from kids at the park for example because other parents pull their kids away from the 3 year old saying fuck and c*nt.

I’m sharing this story to show parents how much I appreciate brothers and parents who raise their children the right way!

So I once dated a guy in secondary school, in the same year as me, and one random day he asked for my home address. I gave him it thinking nothing of it and that same night he came to my home unexpected, with no less than 6 of his older male friends (I never met or knew their names). I wanted to go with him and his friends, even though it was around 11pm and a black winter night. And my parents were out so I knew I would get away with it.

However my older brother was there (thank goodness) and forced me into the living room and demanded that I’m not going anywhere. He then stormed to the door and forced everyone one of them, including my boyfriend, away and told them to never come back. I don’t think he knew them either, all he knew was that I’m his baby sister and over his body was I going out with those boys at all.

I fell away from him that night, kinda grew apart and never talked to him again (my boyfriend)

BUT guess who I’ve just seen in the news for 13 separate accounts of r*pe and violence against girls? My old boyfriend. It happened over a series of years and he’s finally been caught and jailed. If it weren’t for my big brother protecting me and standing up against 7 boys, that were the same age as him and some older, I know I would’ve been another of his victims. He wanted to take me to a PARK IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM AND HIS UNKNOWN GANG! Honestly I’ve always appreciated my brother, he stepped up and was the man that I needed growing up. But tonight I’ve just seen how much us girls need their brothers, how much they really care for us and how much love I have for him.

My mum raised him that way, to always stand for what he believed in, to always protect women and to never lay a hand on them. He once ran down a dark alley way after hearing a woman scream, not once thinking about his own safety, but the safety of that unknown woman. Thank you mothers and fathers who are raising these types of sons and putting real protectors and great men out into the world. I would’ve been beaten and r*ped that night, but it was my brother who prevented that.

Now, I really don’t mind being with my brother, although he is a handful he’s the most precious boy ever.

The absence of our parents in his daily life had lead him to call me both Mum and Dad. When I leave the house I am bombarded with messages begging me to come home because he won’t settle or videos of him crying for “mum” while being in my mother’s arms.

When he was 10 months old my father was incarcerated and of course, my mother withdrew and I was left to parent him, this is where it started. After my father served his sentence I was forced to drop out of school to take care of my baby brother because my parents both had jobs at the time, which was fine with me, but the toll of being only fifteen and by myself with a child who I can barely communicate with is starting to get to me.

For background, we live in a really safe neighborhood. I'm usually very safety-conscious, almost too safety-conscious. So when I think something is safe and the people around me think I'm crazy, I decided it was time to ask for anonymous feedback from my hundred thousand closest friends on Reddit.

  
My kid is five years old. We live 3 blocks from his elementary school. He only has to cross one street and there is a crossing guard. He knows his way around the neighborhood really well and is really good with safety rules. Our neighbors know him. I absolutely love walking him to and from school, but I also think he *could* walk to school by himself. As I see it, the biggest danger would be if he decides to wander somewhere else instead of school. Putting an AirTag in his backpack should address this, or watching him walk until I can't see him anymore - once he turns the corner to school and I can't see him, the crossing guards will be able to see him. Plus he's a really responsible kid for his age. Of course there's also the danger of kidnapping, but realistically, those kinds of stranger kidnappings are exceedingly rare. 

So, what do you all think? Can he walk to school by himself? Am I underestimating the risks?

She has BPD and cannot hold a job because of her disability and regularly floats between her parents house and living in campers/vans/random men if she gets into fights with them. She's been in jail for DV ans class 6 felony child neglect before and her other children were taken from her.

I have full physical and legal custody and visitation is telephonic at my discretion since we live in separate states along with her pattern of instability. She only requests to call once or twice a month at most and recently she wanted to have a video call about ""the talk"" which I find highly inappropriate for her to request.

It got me wondering — as parents, do we unintentionally pick out toys that we think are “gender-appropriate” for our kids? Like, I always find myself picking out toy cars for my son, as if that’s just what boys are supposed to play with. But then I started thinking, do toys actually influence their future interests, self-image, or even what careers they might consider? Most toy ads still divide toys by gender: girls’ toys are about caring and gentleness, while boys’ toys are about adventure and strength. Could this limit kids from exploring a wider range of activities and interests?

As parents, Should we push for toys that don’t have a gender label, or just let them choose freely without worrying about the gender thing at all?

I’d love to hear what you all think about this. Do you pay attention to gender when you pick out toys for your kids? How much do you think toys influence their sense of identity and interests? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",2024-11-12 20:39:39

We love it. It’s never a problem. The girls get off the bus at our house every afternoon. They haven’t stayed in a couple weeks and I mentioned that I missed having them. I was pleasantly surprised when mom asked if the youngest could stay. A little while later my son calls and asks to speak with my granddaughter. I can hear him fussing at her and she says but daddy, I asked mom if it would be ok with you too? I could see she was getting upset about it..Then I guess he told her he was just messing with her because she relaxed and looked relieved.

He does this kind of stuff a lot and I really hate it. He thinks it’s funny but I see it as being mean. I’m close to my son and He’s a good dad, they are both good parents but they both just think it’s cute to do things like that.. I haven’t said anything to him. If I did, as long as I just expressed concern, it wouldn’t cause problems but I don’t know if I’m overreacting.  He’s a pretty strict parent so getting in trouble has pretty serious consequences in their home. Not abusive but strict. Anyway, am I overreacting and should I just keep my concerns to myself.

This was her mother’s idea after my last visit and I’m so excited because I want to show my baby how fun Dad is to go out with! I want to see her smile and laugh as much as possible. 

Reddit is filled with so many good ideas so I thought I’d ask for some!!

We are in Tucson area if that helps with ideas. 

So far I have some toys and a sensory bin that I want give to her when I get to her mom’s house. One of our ideas was Build a Bear but I thought it wasn’t good enough, even tho she loves stuffed animals. I just want to do something she knows Dad made happen, because mom will be there too.

WHY THIS MATTERS SO MUCH TO ME AND WHY IM REALLY ASKING: in July, I admitted to relapsing and throwing away five years of clean time so I don’t see my little angel as much as I used to. especially when I kept struggling. I now have 44 days clean and see her every other weekend, these last couple times at her mother’s house. 

, even though her mom and I were “coparenting”, we talked to each other all day every day, I was man of the house, took care of the property, was her 11 yr old son’s best friend, family vacations. I was always so focused on why her mom and I weren’t together, but what I didn’t realize is, I had what I wanted all along and that was a family. And I’ve lost them.

My heart hasn’t stopped breaking since. The reason I share, is because I want my damn family back and if I can’t, I want my little girl to be the happiest in the world so please help me with some good ideas. Not looking to fix my problems with an epic day, just thought a little extra effort could maybe go a long way.

I hate to say it but I've internalised and inherited some of that, albeit in a lighter version. The father of my child, similarly, is prone to what I'd label ""explosively angry behaviour"", but we see this differently. We don't live in the US BTW, so nationality specific advice won't help.

Our son is almost one year old. He doesn't get unreasonably angry or throw tantrums, and I don't want him to grow up suffering from or tainted with his parents' lousy coping strategies.

Suggesting a psychologist or counseling is no good, I know this would be great for us, individually or as a couple, we've also benefited from it before, but even bringing it up seems to trigger a fight. So while I'd like to get there, this is not the place to start. 

My question to you is: The ones of you who are facing a similar problem - do you know of some easily accessible resources - TED talks, scientific articles or similar, to encourage working with this. I'm thinking both in terms of consequences for the child, but maybe moreso self awareness, acknowledging one's own anger, identifying that it's there. And importantly the difference between healthy and unhealthy anger responses.

Because in order to be helped one has to want help, meaning that one has to realise that one has a problem. And that one wants to change this.",2024-11-13 10:10:08

Advice or other suggestions, please.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gq5syu/potty_training_a_child_with_a_delay_advice_or/,7,"I'm a mom to an almost 19 month old, and recently we have been having the problem of her completely undressing herself. This happens multiple times a day, and at first was just like ""oh well, that's fine,"" unless we had to go somewhere very soon- until now. She's figured out the diaper, too. She fiddles with the front of it until the straps break or pop off. I have a newborn as well, and she usually ends up doing these things right when I'm unable to get up and stop her. I have tried putting the diaper on backwards, and that had a bit more success. I have also tried putting biker shorts on under zip-up PJs, but she has figured out both of those as well (she pulls her arms up and out of the head-hole and then pulls it down her body). I feel as though I have tried almost everything to either keep her diaper on, or prevent her from getting to it, but she outsmarts my every attempt. Potty training this early is my last resort, especially while also having a newborn, because I am the primary (almost sole) caregiver for both of my girls and the likelihood I will have help is very slim.

We recently had both an early-intervention evaluation and did our developmental self-test (including MCHAT-R) and she failed the MCHAT-R both times, scoring a 7 when done by the professionals and scoring an 8 when I filled out the form. She's not talking at all yet, and I'm unsure as to how well she actually understands when I'm speaking to her. She tested at the level of a 9 month old in this area. So, with this context, I do not know how to go about potty-training. The advice I got from my parents was to put her on her training potty 30 minutes after drinking/eating and holding there until she goes, to also get her up every so often & hold her there overnight, and to use training diapers. I have a strong feeling she will fight me tooth and nail as she hates sitting still unless it is on my lap. 

Is this the right route to take? Are there other options for me to try? I know one of the hardest things when it comes to potty training is whether they are actually ready or not, but with everything else going on I truly do not know what else to do.

Is it talk to the ped? Talk to school? Does she need OT or psychiatry to assess? 
Some signs we’ve seen:

Lack of coordination still in some atmospheres
Anxiety of heights, possibly depth perception issue

Upset about light or sun in eyes

Increased pickiness with foods

Upset by smells, food, environment, bathroom

Occasionally socks are “too soft” 

Upset with atmospheres with a lot of people talking 

Restless sleep (this has been forever) 

Sleep anxiety now 

Upset by people touching her, upset if told not to touch others

Emotionally when corrected lightly it is elevated on her part.

Doesn’t like hands to be dirty for long or at all

Occasionally spits out food

I feel like there is more but some of this I had been writing off as developmental for a 3-4 year old but now I’m thinking we are dealing with sensory? Or maybe we’re not I’m just looking for any feedback.
May help to add I think it’s leading to some anxiety  and I have anxiety and my spouse thinks he may have undiagnosed autism with adhd.

The night starts off good, we run through our bed time routine (dinner, bath, teeth, snuggles, sleep). Once she falls asleep, I leave the room. She is going to bed at 7:30/8 pm. 

She is up probably 6-7 times a night. She SCREAMS at the top of her lungs to be let out of her room. She cries, slams on the door, stomps her feet, etc. She will do this for hours if we let her. She has a child door protector on the inside of her door because the door has a lock and we don’t want her locking it. Also my dad is a firefighter, so I believe the bedroom doors remaining shut at night is extremely important. 

We come open the door, tuck her back in(she’s usually kicking and screaming at this point), then leave the room. She just won’t stop. We’ve tried the occasional melatonin, no screens, solid bedtime routine, anything we can think of. 

If we let her sleep in our bed, we’re miserable. Our bed is only a queen so genuinely there’s no room- also I just want to sleep alone with my husband. It’s starting to affect my mental health, our sleep, and ultimately our relationship with her. We’re up so much throughout the night, I feel like I have a newborn again. I am really starting to resent her and genuinely don’t want to be around her. Sleep is so vital and she is the reason we’re not getting any. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve invested in 50 night lights, a star projector, melatonin. It feels like nothing works. I feel so desperate at this point. I feel like I’m causing her trauma just letting her scream in her room but also at some point I have to put my health first. She goes to preschool everyday from 745-145,  she is extremely active during the day both mentally and physically.

I work in tech and my job is so mentally exhaustive I NEED sleep. My husband is a blue collar worker and he NEEDS sleep. 

Please help. :( ",2024-11-13 05:06:43

She struggles with executive functioning and has adhd. She does great in languages and has strong writing skills but still doesn’t apply herself fully. She has this dream of going to an elite school and living on campus. Unfortunately, I don’t think she has the abilities to get in. We have been discussing many options that would fit her strengths in varied fields but at 16 she knows everything and won’t change her mind. I’m sad thinking about next year when the guidance councillor gives her a reality check of possible options based on her grades. 

What else can I do to prepare her, I’m afraid she will feel hopeless and left out as her friends go off to these schools and she is left behind. She wants to go into Psychology and social sciences. 

She has a tutor but grades are just passing and the little she does do puts her at capacity mentally and emotionally.  

Is this something I just let happen as I have tried to warn her and encourage her to apply herself more?

I am feeling so low right now. Reaching out in the hopes of some success stories or similar experiences. My 9 month old has eczema and had a recent reaction that warranted a trip to the ER. She ended up being fine but our pediatrician recommended a blood test to confirm allergies. Welp, she’s currently extremely allergic to cat dander—a level 6— (and we have a cat!!!) wheat, eggs, dairy, peanuts. I am feeling so depressed about this. I’ve heard it’s likely she’ll grow out of these but the anxiety about this is killing me. The doc prescribed us an epi pen because the ones I mentioned were all 4-6. I exclusively breastfeed and now I have to cut them all out of my diet and add back in to see if she reacts. I have given her cheese, bread and eggs before and she didn’t have a severe reaction, but “the numbers are the numbers,” as our doc said. I don’t know how to process this. It’s so hard. I feel so sad. Thanks in advance for any insight or guidance or just anything.. struggling right now to keep perspective and stay positive. 🥺 ",2024-11-13 00:47:30

His sister is his dad’s child with another woman. Me and dad are no longer together and we split custody. When it’s time for my son to go to his dad’s, he doesn’t want to go. A lot of times he calls his dad and asks him if he can stay home for that day. I always ask him why he doesn’t want to go and since the beginning of the year, he’s been saying the same thing: his sister. He loves going to his dad’s house when she’s not there. We recently had our son’s birthday party and of course his sister was there. My son avoided her for the most part, or when she came around him, he’d get upset and get away from her. What do I do? How do I go about this? It’s caused an issue between me and his father because our son is constantly begging me to keep him home. Dad is convinced that I’m “turning our son against him” but I’m not. Idk what to do. 

Not completely relevant, but I thought I’d add: My son constantly tells me he wants me to have a baby. I told him that he already has a sister, and his response is “I want a baby from you” and he specifically wants a girl. So I doubt the problem is just typical sibling issues.

I also want to add that his sister unfortunately has a bad reputation amongst some adults, and they don’t want their children around her… but my son is her sibling. I just don’t know. ",2024-11-12 20:56:00

parenting,1gov3vu,One of my teens friends stole from us ,839,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gov3vu/one_of_my_teens_friends_stole_from_us/,167,"Once a month we host board game night. My son is 16, he invited 3-5 friends over, and it’s a good wholesome time. They play hide and seek, they game on the computer downstairs, they play card games, I order 3 large pizzas and provide snacks. It’s not cheap in this economy but I believe it’s important for teenagers to socialize in person and not just online/on discord.

I’ve known most of his friends for years. 

The other night after his friends left I noticed my brand new ps5 remote was missing. It’s my PlayStation; they didn’t play it, but it was sitting on the coffee table in the living room and it’s gone. We just moved into our place 3 months ago; we don’t have tons of furniture, so it was pretty easy to comb the entire house and see that it is in fact gone, not just misplaced. 

I have my suspicion it is his newest friend Mark. Mark has never been to my house before. He was the only newcomer to the party, and I’ve known the other kids a long time and would be really surprised if it were them.

I told my son game night is on hiatus until the remote is returned. I asked him who he thought took it, and he said he finds it hard to believe anyone took it but if he had to guess it would be mark. I asked him to text his friends and see if it somehow got mixed up in their stuff. I’m not sure he did, he doesn’t like to ruffle feathers. 


I replaced the controller. I’m annoyed, but it is what it is. Where do I go from here? No more game nights? Exclude mark on my hunch? 

I hate to ruin a fun tradition but it makes me feel like I can’t trust these kids in my house if they’re capable of stealing from me, and I worry about what else they could take. I’m also a bit bitter as a single mom who works hard to provide the accommodations and food and snacks for these game nights to feel like my kindness was taken advantage of.",2024-11-11 15:41:06

I’m here for some advice. 
Little back story: 
My cousin is in grade 5, hasn’t hit puberty yet. 
Lost his dad when he was 3 due to an unfortunate accident. Over recent times, there have been a lot of complaints from his school and private tutors who tutor him in all subjects at school, English, maths, etc, however seems so that he isn’t doing well academically. I suspect there is a learning disability or an IQ lower than average due to which he is unable to cope. 
He also has behavioural issues such as lying to your face about finishing homework, assignments, etc and is absolutely fearless when he lies. He is also addicted to his iPad/ phone. Inspite of his mum locking it or hiding it; he’s so dedicated to find it that he does manage to find it, his mum goes to work, so she is unable to monitor 24/7. 
He does have a very compassionate private tutor, who tutors him for an hour 6 days a week and comes back after an hour since she also teaches the neighbours kid, to check in and he hasn’t gotten anything done but doesn’t care. 
The other day, the principal called us, and he did not tell us, the school demanded for a letter of explanation for the no show. He did not take it to school. 
(This is not in Canada, so the school system is not westernized.) 
I’m just here to ask for advice on what tests should we go for to rule out the issue and help the poor boy out. 
I’m flying back home in December for a week, with a super tight schedule, and nobody in my family seems to bother to take the time out to take him because it’s definitely time consuming. His mother is very strict, but he’s not fearful of her either. She shouts at him and does her best to discipline him but it seems to make no difference in his behaviour. 
I would understand that he may require therapy but I cannot put him in therapy until I am able to show them a statement from the psychiatrist/ psychologist/ tester ruling out the problem and where he needs help.

A few months ago, my daughter informed me that she was brought into the vice principal office as it was gradually getting worse. Name calling my daughter, telling my niece she should just ki** herself,  Threatening to beat them up.  I don't hear a single thing from the school. During the same week, I found out that the mother of the brother and sister corners my daughter and niece and starts harassing them. I flip out. Send an email to the Vice Principal, teacher.ect. Vice Principal call me the next day and leaves a message. I return the call within an hour and leave a message, and do not hear from anyone but the teacher claiming he's been out of the office. My daughter told me that they sat down and did conflict resolution. I'm fine they seem to be okay.
My niece, on the other hand, keeps being harassed by the cousin. He calls her names, pushes her. He literally goes out of his way to intimidate her. I have witnessed it a few times and calm her down. Her parents are very non confortional.

He has always been a big crier, but lately it's become surreal. I haven't slept in 2 weeks. He has never slept through the night, but at least I'm used to him going to sleep at 6 pm, waking up around 1am and then I bring him to my bed and we continue to sleep just fine.

But lately... he wakes up around 9 pm and it's impossible to settle him, he is just crying, and then suddenly clapping, then crying, then throwing himself. And I'm like JUST SHUT UP AND GO TO SLEEP. I've even talked to him in an agressive way and handled him a bit too strongly, and then I hate myself.

He is such a hard baby. My 3 year old is so easy in comparison. Good lord. Is he going to be a hard, crier toddler?

In the end I just put him in his stroller (while he cried and fought me) and strolled through my house until he fell asleep.

For weeks I haven't had  a life. He wakes up crying and I have to handle him while preparing to go to work. I pick him up from daycare and he starts crying as soon as we reach home.

I made the decision today to leave home with my almost 4 year-old and my five month old to stay at my moms for a week. 
I took my girls 2 1/2 hours away from home. But not on a whim, not to be petty, not to use them as pawns or prove a point. But to Protect their innocent souls. Things between their dad and I have gotten more tense over the last year or so and our three year-old has started to pick up on things and I don’t want her to be affected long-term. 
We got into it yesterday which lead us to getting into it over text while he was at work this morning. When I finally had enough of being accused of being untrustworthy and a liar and being gaslit and manipulated, I asked my mom to come get me and my girls until things simmer down so we both have space and time to think. So that he can reflect and understand that I will not stand for subjecting my girls to such toxicity. We used to have a very healthy relationship, but I think mental illness And daily beer drinking for quite a few years now has played a roll in this downfall. 
I don’t plan on getting a separation or divorce. I plan on making our marriage work out, but I’m tired of always being  in the wrong. I’ve never done anything sneaky or untrustworthy for him to treat me like I have other than cross boundaries that didn’t exist until they were crossed after years of them not existing.
Tonight He called for a bedtime and sobbed to our three-year-old telling her to be brave. Keep her head up be strong. It’s not her fault. When I told him that I was removing us from the situation because our girls didn’t need to be aware or in the middle of our adult business, he said that I was just keeping his girls from him. Bit here he is emotionally manipulating our daughter.  he also demanded that I make sure to let her know the reason we’re really away from home which is not my plan because I’m trying to protect her. After the phone call, I was left to hold her while she sobbed and clean up the pieces of the mess he made once again because she doesn’t understand what’s going on and why we’re not at home. We made a trip to Nana‘s house without daddy or the dogs.
I’ve tried so hard all day to be strong and keep on chugging along protecting her and trying to make sure that she doesn’t feel like there’s something wrong at home because I don’t want to shake her sense of security and stability. I’ve done my best to be positive in front of her and stay off the subject around her or redirect her if she starts to get upset About not being home.

My 7-year-old son is very athletic but also sensitive, and he's chosen an individual sport that comes naturally to him. In practices, he’s usually one of the smallest but also one of the scrappiest. He works incredibly hard and shows a real commitment to improving, and other parents often comment on his talent, both to him and to us.

Recently, he participated in his first competition. He didn’t perform badly—finished in the middle of the pack with a clean run. But when he realized he didn’t place in the top three, he was heartbroken. Now he’s back to enjoying practice but has started saying he doesn’t want to compete again until he “knows he will win.”

I’m torn on what to do next. Should I sign him up for another meet soon to help him work through this? Or should I give him time until he feels more ready to try again?

We've never dealt with anything like this before, so I'm still in the information-gathering part. She is a full-time college student who is normally a very upbeat, happy goofball that I joke about being an overgrown child. She's absolutely hilarious and has that kind of personality that genuinely brightens any room she walks into. Last Friday, she was out drinking with her friends (college party) and long story short, went back to her room and tried to OD on her anxiety medication. I've known she has struggled in the past with cutting, and I thought she was doing much better with that. As of right now, she's been diagnosed with major depression, but I suspect she is bipolar. She sees her regular psychiatrist on the 25th of this month, and is on Cymbalta for the time being. 



The hospital she was at wasn't the kind you hear horror stories about, but wasn't really fantastic either. They provided minimal information to both her and me as far as what we need to do at home to help keep her safe while we get whatever this is under control. My main question for you all is about creating a locked cabinet in the kitchen for sharp utensils. The impression I'm getting from her is that she needs the deterrence, but it doesn't seem like it needs to be Fort Knox either. I don't want to take any chances, so what would you recommend? I have plenty of cabinet space, so I can easily establish one that remains locked at all times. I have 3 kids, two are adults and in college and my youngest is in 3rd grade. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what is the most practical and safe way to go about this? We didn't get home until 9 last night, and I spent last week getting classes/assignments handled, packing up whatever I thought she might need in her dorm, and dropping off books to her at the hospital. I'm only just now able to sit for a minute and start working on a gameplan going forward. 

  
I don't know what I don't know at the moment, so I'll take any and all advice you're willing to offer. While I knew she had bad days, I had no idea these demons were lurking and I don't have anyone that I can ask in my personal life for advice. My husband's mom is bipolar, so while she is a helpful resource, she was on her own and in her 50's when she was diagnosed. I don't know any parents in my position. My initial goals for this week are bloodwork from her pediatrician (hospital mentioned she was Vitamin D deficient, but nothing in the paperwork they sent home), attorney for POA's and information on what her/my rights are if she's ever admitted again, and an outpatient clinic near us to get her started in a program there.

I have tried redirecting him, expressing that it hurts. I say, “mama got ouchie” and he will repeat after me but will continue hurting me. I tried modeling positive behavior by playing pretend where another adult (e.g. my mom) shows affection and shows how to use “gentle hands”, or we play “gentle hands” with his plush toys. 

My son goes to daycare/nursery and his teachers haven’t reported any negative behavior. They say he’s generally very jolly, social - more recently telling me he’s talkative. They only have positive feedback about him. 

With his father he’s very affectionate, cuddly, friendly. So all this negative energy is directed only towards me. 

I am at my wits end. I don’t know what to do. 

Is this just a phase? Am I a terrible mother? Does my child hate me?",2024-11-12 19:28:24

(we live in the midwest) She does work a lot more than I do... sometimes later and sometimes needing to on the weekend or travel a couple days a month.   We make it work just fine right now, but she is kinda going back and forth if I quit my job and took care of everything in the house (cooking, cleaning, shopping, kids getting ready in the mornings, etc...) that it might make our lives less stressful.  We did just get a puppy a couple months ago which hasn't helped.   Just wondering if others have done this on here and wonder if they have regretted it or enjoyed it?

parenting,1gpyd1s,Kids picking on my daughter at the park,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpyd1s/kids_picking_on_my_daughter_at_the_park/,1,"Sorry for long post please take time to read if you can. 

So we had a shitty situation today and I don’t know if I handled it correctly. Bit of backstory my daughter is 18months and she has hip dysplasia and has been wearing a hip brace for the past 3 months. We’ve always gone to the park more or less everyday and that didn’t stop when she got the brace put on, of course at first I was worried about other kids pointing it out but to be honest it never really happened just a few stares but thats expected, I’ve even had 2 little kids ask nicely what it is and why she wears it which of course I have no problem with. About 2 months ago there was 3 boys (2 brothers and their friend) I’d say about 6-9years old) and as my daughter was walking past them the friend pointed laughing and said haha look at that baby she’s wearing a giant nappy outside her pants (the brace is white and worn outside her clothes) and the two brothers also pointed and laughed, obviously this made me so angry and made me feel so sad for my daughter but I ignored because i thought to myself they are just silly kids. I hated myself for weeks after this I felt like such a loser that I didn’t stick up for her I kept telling myself it was because they are just kids but really it’s because I was scared. I’ve never been able to stand up for myself and always been an extreme people pleaser, I’ve only started to try and shift from this since my daughter being born because I’m trying with all my might to break the cycle for her. Anyway today the same boy as last time (one of the brothers ,the younger one) was with a girl I haven’t seen there before (this is our local park) my daughter was walking around near them and I heard the girl saying something to the boy I didn’t hear it exactly but something along the lines of “look at the girl look how she’s walking” then they proceeded to mock the way my daughter was walking (she has a bit of a waddle because of the brace) this absolutely infuriated me . I fucking snapped , I went very close to the kids and shouted at them “ what do you think your saying about my daughter come on spit it out” they both looked so scared and immediately started denying it I said “I saw how you were mocking her walking how dare you she’s just a baby, are you 2 bullies? Is that why your playing together because your both bullies?” They didn’t say much just stared up at me looking terrified , I said “you better not say anything about her again you two leave her alone , ye should be ashamed of yourselves” and I walked off. I did ask them both where the parents were but they wouldn’t tell me and left the park after this (I know who the brothers mom and dad are but I did not see them around today) 

In my heart I feel like I did the right thing but because of all my childhood trauma shaping me into such an empathetic people pleasing wimp it was so uncomfortable for me and I can’t help but feel guilty, even though I would’ve felt a million times more guilty if I didn’t say anything ,I was never stood up for as a child (mother abandoned me and my 3 siblings so my dad raised us) he had a lot of childhood trauma too and he was never able to stand up for us and it was such a horrible feeling as a child. I WILL NOT BE THAT PARENT ABSOLUTELY NOT. I need my daughter to always know I will do anything to protect her.

My husband is a lot more fearless and he wasn’t there when it happened but I called him to explain he said I was too soft on them I should’ve threatened to “kick their f*****g asses” and should’ve called the little girl 4 eyes (she wore glasses) I personally don’t believe in being aggressive and violent just to get a point across and stand up for yourself or your child and I would hope to teach my daughter the same thing.

So in short. I have a son that is now about 8 months old. He's a healthy sweetheart.

I'm looking into what me and my wife can do to optimize his PHYSICAL development long term. Pshycological and personality development is of course as, or more, important, but please consider it out of scope as to not make this too wide. It's one or two separate threads I think.

The purpose is quite simply to influence what we can to give him the best possible outlook in life.

I'm mainly talking things such as
Maximizing 
- height
- IQ (e.g. breast feeding for as long as possible)
- muscle mass 
- facial beauty development (e.g. avoiding mouth breathing)

And minimizing likelihood of
- allergies (e.g. eating certain foods such as nuts, but avoiding poor processed crap)
- asthma
- any serious diseases
- poor eye sight

Etc.

Any articles or book recommendations on how to achieve this is IMMENSELY appreciated. The more science the better.

Many thanks in advance!

parenting,1gpy8vi,Kindergarten “bullying”,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpy8vi/kindergarten_bullying/,1,"Looking to see if anyone has any advice or knowledge about our situation. Sorry it’s long.  

Our daughter (5) started K this year and has struggled a bit so far with impulse control, emotional regulation, and general body boundaries. She’s incredibly bright, and she can verbalize after the fact, but struggles in the moment. Our pediatrician has refused to do an ADHD evaluation so far. She was in a much smaller in-home daycare before this, and is now in a class of 27. It’s obviously been a huge change.  

Since the beginning of the year, we’ve had a few issues with our daughter mostly poking/touching, but sometimes kicking/hitting other kids, but mostly one kid. The incidents always seemed to be impulse-control related and occur when there’s a lack of supervision- in lines, waiting for bus, at recess and lunch. So we worked with her teacher to put measures in place- assigned spot in line/on bus, waiting in separate areas, etc.  

I’ll also note that we know the other parents of the one other kid in question and I’ve been in contact with the mom, letting her know what measures we/the school are putting in place and that we’re working on it. The dad is an asshole, but she’s seemed understanding.  

Everything seemed to be working and improving, and then last week there was an incident in the before care program that led to the other parents filing an official bullying form. We were notified and she was moved to a new K class the next day. This has obviously been hugely disruptive. She’s a resilient kid, but she’s sad and stressed and it’s been a tough week on all of us.  

We later found out from the before care program that this final incident was instigated by the other child, and that it’s not the first time the other child has provoked. They said our daughter actually does a great job staying away, but the other girl follows and annoys her until she reacts. Of course our daughter shouldn’t react physically, but she’s 5. They said they’ve talked to the girl’s parents and they refuse to acknowledge that their child is an issue.  

We were allowed to believe by the school this whole time that our daughter was 100% at fault. It now doesn’t seem like that’s the case, and certainly not that it’s targeted “bullying.”  

So now we’re wondering about this form. She’s 5. How long does this stay in her record/brand her as a bully? Do we have any recourse for asking for the form to be removed from her records? Do we file some sort of counter form to have it on record? ",2024-11-12 23:04:06

I am really starting to struggle with parenting. As a baby and early toddler, he was an easy kid. I think we got really lucky in that department. 
Since he's hit 3, it started to be a bit more of a struggle. It continues to be more and more of a struggle. 
We used to switch every other week, one with his mom, one with us and so on. Due to things that have happened, the last 3 months he has lived with us full time and most likely will remain this way. I know that trauma can really effect a child's behavior and the last three months things have improved. Less tantrums, he doesn't go to the bathroom in his pants anymore, he talks a lot more. We think that he may have ADHD (my bf has it). He has no attention span, past what I think is normal for a toddler.
The main problem that I'm having is that the only listens to my boyfriend. I have absolutely no authority. I have tried everything. Time outs, trying to talk it out in a way that he can understand, taking away toys or screen privelages (I try to limit tv time/tablet time because I really fear creating an iPad kid), and raising my voice and being firm (I am incredibly soft hearted and I hate doing this). But nothing works. He will say he's sorry sometimes, so I think he knows right from wrong. When my boyfriend is home, he listens. Still little issues but he seems to follow rules better. As soon as my boyfriend leaves, it's a free for all. I'm talking as soon as the door closes behind him. Vaulting over furniture, chasing the cats around, I'll ask him to quiet down and he ignores me. I'll ask him to play in his room when I'm trying to clean or when I just need a moment and he ignores this. He locked me out of the house once when I was signing for a delivery on my porch. He asks for food, I'll give him specifically what he asks for and then he won't eat it.  My boyfriend will emphasize to him that he needs to listen to me but that doesn't do much. 
I've tried to take him to parks and go on long walks around the neighborhood to get the energy out, during the summer we play in the back yard. 
Sometimes things are okay. Like today, we went to the store and he behaved. He even helped me carry in groceries and then played quietly. After awhile, back to the usual. 
I'm really at a loss, I don't know what to do. I love him so much, and he really is a sweetheart but I don't know how to get him to behave. I know with a learning disability that can create issues. We're looking into getting him diagnosed and get him into behavioral therapy. In the mean time, please give me some advice. I am exhausted and I feel like I can't be a good parent when I'm like this. I didn't have a great childhood and I want so much to give him what I didn't have. But I'm struggling. ",2024-11-12 22:59:15

parenting,1gppbi7,Need advice on how to improve my daughter’s (13) habits ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gppbi7/need_advice_on_how_to_improve_my_daughters_13/,8,"So, a little background on my daughter - I was a single mom who had her at 21. Her dad was not willing to be in the picture so it was just her and I for the first few months of her life. Her dad then decided he wanted to be around so we co-parented for a bit until we naturally started a relationship. We stayed together until she was about 2, me always being the primary parent as he was extremely careless and immature. Once we broke up, he would only see her every other weekend, and that was if he didn’t dump her on his parents during his time. My daughter and I lived alone until she was 9 and then I met my husband. We all moved in together and have been living together since. 

My husband had never lived with a kid so it was an adjustment for sure. They generally got along pretty well, minus a few hiccups here and there. We now have a 10 month old baby and I thought my daughter, who loves kids, would really mature with having a new baby around. She is great with her sister and loves her dearly. But it is almost like my daughter is regressing in behaviour. She has certain chores or “tasks” to accomplish daily. Feed the cat, clean the litter, take out the garbage to the garage (if full) and clear the dish tack. She is responsible to keep her room clean, make her lunch for school and ensure her homework gets done (I check). She was doing well for a while but lately, it’s been like pulling teeth to get her to get off her butt to help out. She forgets half the stuff she’s supposed to do and when I remind her she says “I forgot”. Fair, everyone forgets. But lately it’s everyday. Now when I remind her, she rolls her eyes at me and walks away. We’ve tried being nice and harsh, both don’t work. I’ve been teaching her how to do laundry and have told her to let me know when her basket is starting to get full. She won’t, and will start re-wearing dirty clothes out of laziness. She started telling small lies to cover up homework she doesn’t want to do, fights with friends, hiding junk food in her room and it’s like pulling teeth to get her to talk to me. Everyday it’s an argument. I’ve taken her to the doctors to test for any kind of ADD (she gets pretty hyper and has a squirrel brain) but it doesn’t seem that she does, and if so, it is very mild. I’ve made lists to check off, set up reminders for her and even left post it notes. Nothing is working. I don’t want to argue with my child anymore, I want to have a good relationship but I worry about her ability to do anything independently. She also seems to be having social problems, losing friends because she is too much (clingy) and making ones that seem to not treat her well. I just want the best for her. 

Her latest claim is that she doesn’t like my husband and doesn’t enjoy living with him. They have been arguing more lately because of her lack of accountability but nothing crazy. He’s been a great stepdad to her but she compares him to her biological dad, who is a weekend “fun dad” at best. He doesn’t discipline what so ever and let’s her do whatever she wants when she sees him. I now have a second daughter with my husband and I am not leaving him for her satisfaction, he doesn’t deserve that. 

Any advice would be helpful. ",2024-11-12 16:54:06

Our son is 5.5 years old. Recently he has started to develop separation anxiety at home. He doesn’t like to stay alone in a room, when he goes to the toilet, he doesn’t want to close the door, etc. When there are more emotional stories, he becomes scared easily / or compassionate with people facing problems in those stories and he starts to cry easily. It has reached a point where he cannot listen to stories in kindergarten when they become scared, he needs a teacher to console him and bring him to another area in the kindergarten to do another task. 

We have been cosleeping together since he was a baby, but will move to a new apartment in two weeks where he would have his own room. However with his current anxiety issue, i don’t know, if he will be able to do so.

A bit of back story, my partner(45F) and my daughter (6yo) are like fire and gasoline. 
My daughter seems to push her mom's buttons in such a way that there's always yelling, whether it be at dinner, bath time, getting dressed or going to bed.
Sometimes my daughter seems like 2 different kids, as usually with me she eats, gets dressed and everything without much drama but as soon as mom is around she starts misbehaving. 
I don't deal well with conflict so am usually the peacemaker, always trying to calm things down between the two of them.
Tonight I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and daughter came in to ask me if she could have some marshmallows, I said go ask mom.
Mom must've said no because yelling ensues and daughter comes back storming into the kitchen saying she's hungry. I suggested some yogurt and she flatly says NO and storms back out.
I follow her to the living room and told her to go brush her teeth and meet me in her room so I could put her to bed. She says No. I tell her again like 4 times, she kept saying no. So I pick her up and put her in her room which is when she started screaming and I just lost my shit and yelled at her to go brush her teeth.
I think it wasn't so much that I yelled loudly, it was more the sheer anger in my voice and on my face that scared the crap out of her.
I saw a look of fear in her eyes and she ran to the bathroom crying. She kept crying all the way through. 
When she came back to her room I spoke softly but with what must've been a look of piercing anger in my eyes and voice which made her keep sniveling and crying untill she eventually fell asleep.
Afterwards my partner told me that I even scared her.

We absolutely want to take him seriously but don't know how to proceed.

Detailed story:

Recently, on Monday morning, our son (5m) woke up fine, and before we headed downstairs for breakfast and to school, he got frustrated about something (unclear what) and lightly punched me. I implemented a reasonable but meaningful (to him) consequence. The rest of the morning was difficult as he was clearly frustrated about the unnamed thing and almost missed the bus. When we ask what that was about in this situation or similar and at the time of the situation or well after, his response is always ""I don't know.""

That night he gets frustrated at bedtime, again, not terribly unusual but 9 out of 10 nights normally have no issues. He doesn't want to go to bed and I ask why and I get the IDK. I explained that it was bedtime and unless there was something on his mind that needed discussing, he would need to go to bed. It was at this point he opened up possibly more than he ever had and said he didn't like how his friend was treating him. When I asked for more details he said his friend was punching him on the bus. Pretty serious and we proceed to talk for \~20 minutes or so.

Here's the rub: I don't know if he's making up the story or telling the truth. Regardless of whether it is true or not we need to take it seriously. But there are significant consequences in either direction and we're not sure how to proceed.

Reasons I think he might be telling the truth:

* He is a soft-spoken and kind-hearted kid who, and I quote, ""wants to be a kind person"" and the friend in question has a bit more energy than our son and has an older brother who he may rough house with a bit more (we see our second being way rougher than our first).
* It was a fairly elaborate story with a lot of detail
* He *is* a good kid and generally speaking, very rarely lies
* His personality is the type that is/will be susceptible to bullying and not defending himself and certain details in the story lend themselves to this
* We want to believe him because we care and if we don't and don't take action the consequences can be damning.

Reasons I think he might be making up the story:

* While he doesn't lie much he does concoct crazy stories that he says with pure conviction and, for example, it is only later we learn they aren't true when talking to his teacher at parent-teacher conferences.
* After dinner on the same day as me being punched but before the story about punching, said friend's parent asked if he wanted to come over for a play date and our son was SUPER excited.
* He said he told his teacher, the friend's teacher, and the bus driver... knowing our school they would have contacted us had he brought it up to this many people (we have a meeting w/ his social worker at school and we'll discuss tomorrow)
* In the same conversation, he told me that only one kid sits per seat (which is true for kindergarteners on the bus), then said the other kid sat with him (which I also know happens despite the ""rule""), then when I asked him about the 1 kid per seat thing he effectively tried to gaslight me by saying he did not say that and if he had it was another conversation at an earlier date.
* Some details in his story just don't line up
* Someone near us is a social worker who works with kids and said he may have been trying to shift the focus away from his actions earlier in the day and onto someone else
* After discussing lying/consequences he didn't want us to take any action (see below)

Near the end of the conversation, we talked about what lying is and the consequences can be, from there I proceeded to say that this is important to address and that we are happy to bring it up with his parents/the school, but we want him to be in control and asked how he would like to proceed. At that point he said he didn't want us to do anything. Unclear if he's protecting a friend or avoiding getting in trouble for lying. 

So, if you made it this far, thanks. We're at loss and not sure how to proceed and seeking advice.

Some other general background if it is helpful:

* Him getting frustrated like this isn't terribly uncommon but he normally doesn't actually follow through on the punch. He has threatened before but he hasn't actually punched. Similar example: he gets frustrated going to his OT and has lashed out at his mom.
* He's very much the soft/caring/quiet kind of kid over the loud/wild/aggressive type
* He has had a full Neuropsychological assessment completed and there were no material concerns
* We've done talk therapy before but the therapist didn't think it was effective enough to continue given how well he's doing in kindergarten.",2024-11-12 22:06:46

My kids only get a couple of small gifts from santa and they know the rest are from family (it's too much for santa to do)

My 6yo is autistic and very curious about the ins and outs of any story told and that's kinda how we ended up with just a few from santa. 
We recently had to move them to a new school and it's a religious school. 
She ain't buying it (just the same as me when I was a similar age, in trouble for asking about dinosaurs in a catholic school) 

I've explained to her that some people believe in things they have no proof of, so used the same logic as that for santa and for why her classmate would say he's not real
""err dad we got proof, he ate the biscuits and left presents on my bed"" 

Shit! Girls got facts! 

Then her frustration starts and she starts shouting ""well god's not real"" 
We have a talk about respecting others beliefs and it's OK not to believe as much as it is to believe. 
Ive had to convince her not to say that to the classmate because it's hurtful, and just ignore her if she says anything else about santa. 

I spoke with the teacher this morning and they are going to talk to the class about respecting others beliefs. 
But she's already going to be picking holes in the santa story, saying it's magic just isn't going to cut it for long.

We live in a neighborhood with a few kids she calls friends, but not many. We also have her in a 2 day a week outdoor enrichment school, a 1 day a week outdoor learning deal, the circus. She’s been in swimming, gymnastics and softball.

Very intelligent and articulate girl. Not afraid to talk to adults. She’s really good at one-on-one play.

When she was young and at a park or something, she would lock eyes on another kid and say, I’m going to go play with her. Then she’d just make it happen. Very outgoing in that respect. Inspiring actually. As she got older, she lost a little of that, but can still do it. And kids really do seem to like her.

But we are recently realizing that she completely shuts down in groups. Doesn’t participate. Tries to be in the background and just doesn’t want to do what they do. This includes when all the neighborhood kids are over that she otherwise considers good friends. If there is more than two other kids, it’s like she’s not there. Like a ghost watching the other kids play, clearly not able to interject. She would much rather go sit with the adults than participate at all.

The thing is, I know this isn’t on purpose. And she realizes she’s doing it, she just can’t figure out how to change. Being homeschooled and a single child in a small neighborhood, she desperately wants to change so she can have more friends. She craves friends. We talk openly about it, and I try to relate, offer tips that helped me, help her come up with plans, empathize with others, be kind, etc. But it all falls apart when there is a group.

 

For more context, I was the exact same way when I was a kid. And still am to a certain extent. But growing up, it was hell. I was an extremely depressed child as a result. And the fear of god is in me now watching who I consider, My everything, go though that same hell.

 

I’m asking for any ideas. Stories of things you did that helped your similar situation.

 

One thing my wife and I briefly discussed is to create a group in the community for other kids of a similar challenge. Where there are no big group events, we split everyone into groups of two and give them an action or task to perform together, whatever that might be. Maybe build something, arts and crafts, a scavenger hunt, etc. Just whatever that can get two kids together with each others undistracted attention. Really push for positive interactions and inclusion even when difficult. Then after so many times, they will have had a close bond with everyone in the group. So we can then start increasing the group sizes to 3, and so on. Maybe we can observe and give reports to their parents of things that worked for their kid so maybe they can foster that at home. I don’t know, just an idea.",2024-11-12 21:45:19

And I’m feeling really bad about it (for them). 

Context: Daycare costs are insane in our city. We are paying $500 more a month than what my wife brings home from work. Also, we don’t get holidays or vacations from daycare. When they take a week off for Christmas and a week off for summer, we don’t pay less those months. When we go on week long vacations, we still have to pay AND my wife doesn’t usually get paid vacation. Daycare also takes all bank holidays off. 

We always just did it so my wife would get some time with adults, and the kids could get some time with other kids. I work from home and will be available to help throughout the day. 

But as we plan more vacations for next year, it just no longer seems to make sense to us. We can save money, save stress in the early mornings, get more time with our kids at a young age, etc….but.

That means they get less time with friends. They really value their friends at daycare. We can still set up times to see some of them on weekends, but so far we haven’t done a great job at finding other parent friends from their daycare. 

So, for anyone that has done this…did you notice your kids change at all from not being around their friends 5 days a week? ",2024-11-12 17:34:18

From 9 months to 2 years he dropped from 40th percentile to the 1st percentile for weight and has held that since, he has always been about 15th for height. Our family doctor has sent us to two different peds who both said he is just small for his age (my family is small) and he is just on the extreme end of 'normal' for picky. I brought up ARFID but have been brushed off because he doesn't have any other markers for autism or ADHD and was told it is 'almost never' diagnosed without one of those. I've tried therapy twice with him with 2 different SLPs, once at 2 1/2 (online) and once at 4 (in person) and while we could be better about implementing what we learned, I really didn't see much improvement. 

  
He eats basically any fruit or vegetable raw; there are a handful of veggies he eats cooked. This is also where we get brushed off because apparently this isn't typical of picky eaters so he 'just likes what he likes'. But we struggle with fat and protein which he needs to GROW and have ENERGY like I truly don't know how he has energy some days. At this point I feed him his guaranteed foods because I want him to eat SOMETHING and even if he likes a food, it is rare he eats what I consider to be a full serving. I have 2 other kids (3.5 and 15 months) who I introduced to foods the same way as him and they eat basically anything and everything, in much larger portions. 

  
Parents who had picky kids...how did they turn out? Did they grow out of it like I'm being told he will? Are they still super picky? We are a family that loves to eat out and travel and it is so tough to find things he will eat, and then half the time it looks 'different' than at home and he won't eat it. He's old enough to go to drop off parties and playdates, and the parents will tell me he ate nothing while there for hours or nibbled on small things. I don't know what to do anymore!!!

I’m reaching out because I’m really concerned about my 11-month-old daughter, who seems to be in significant pain with no clear diagnosis so far. Especially when she’s waking up she has strong pain reactions, even biting my shoulder during some of the worst moments. Here’s what we’ve noticed:

She struggles with sitting, and even sitting in her high chair now seems uncomfortable for her.

When lying down, she often keeps her right leg bent and to the side.

Whenever we move her right thigh, she immediately places her hand on it, even if she’s holding something.


What’s strange is that this started suddenly. She used to always want to sit up, and now it seems painful for her to do so.

We’ve already had X-rays and an ultrasound of her hips, both of which came back normal. After two ER visits, doctors focused on her hips but found nothing unusual, and they haven’t expanded their search. It’s heartbreaking to see her suffer, and we feel lost not knowing how to help. We will see a pediatric orthopedic surgeon next week.

About two weeks ago, she had a 15-day period where she seemed to improve, but in the past week, things have gotten worse again. She’s a big baby for her age—76 cm and 10.6 kg (around 23 lbs). I’m not sure if that might be relevant, but I thought I’d mention it.

Someone please help me because my 3.5yo refuses to go potty. On a very, VERY rare occasion she will ask to sit and sit for a grand total of 5 seconds. Otherwise she screams and runs away or throws herself on the ground. I don’t want to turn the toilet into a punishment so I don’t push it. However, SHES 3.5 YEARS OLD.

I have tried everything I can think of. I have tried:
- buying “special big girl” pull-ups and underpants
- candy rewards (2 m&ms if she sits, a handful if she pees, and a popsicle if she poops)
- buying little portable potties and a potty seat for the big toilet with print she likes
- Using an alarm to go sit every 15 minutes
- Waiting her out by having her sit there until she goes
- Having her go naked around the house and trying to catch her when she starts peeing with the portable potty (this is very difficult because I have a younger toddler who is also running around)

None of this is working. She holds it until I put the diaper/pull-up/underwear back on and uses that right away.

When I tried waiting her out I only lasted two days. She sat for 6.5hrs each day. She had three or four cups of juice and lunch while sitting on the toilet. We sang, read her favorite books, and played games. I put on her favorite show to see if distracting her enough would make her forget to hold it. She lasted 6.5 f***ing hours before she peed a little bit. I gave her a standing ovation and had a dance party before getting her off. I about cried from happiness. I put a diaper on her and sat her at the table, walked 10 steps to grab the m&’s, and came back to a diaper so full I had to change it right then or risk it leaking. I then about cried from frustration. 

I don’t know what to do. I almost had her younger sister potty trained around 18 months but now that she’s refusing her younger sister is refusing. I go to put the younger one on the potty and she screams and flails - sometimes she looks at her older sister and then does it.

I didn’t try potty training my oldest until she was 27 months because she didn’t walk until she was 26 months old. She had undiagnosed celiac disease which stunted her growth and delayed physical milestones. She’s off gluten now, though, and caught up to where she should be. The doctor says this should no longer be interfering with potty training.

I’m at the end of my rope and have given up for now. Even the thought of starting again brings me to the edge of tears. Does anyone have any suggestions? Am I going to have the only kid in kindergarten wearing diapers? Do I find a service to pay to send someone to potty train my kid? What do I do?


Edit: thank you all for the responses. The ideas and encouragement are so helpful. To the person who reported me with concern for my mental health, I appreciate it - I’m not that far gone but I will keep those resources in mind should I ever need them.",2024-11-12 16:29:09
parenting,1gpu64v,School Attendance meeting,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpu64v/school_attendance_meeting/,2,"This is just a rant. My daughters only 8 & in 2nd grade.

We had an attendance meeting with my daughters Assistant Principal for missing 7 days this school year which dropped her down to 85% school attendance. All are excused absences from being sick, we dont keep her home just because she has a runny nose. She caught a cold right before Labor Day weekend. then 2 weeks later she got some sort of stomach bug, and then another two weeks later she was sick and ended up with an ear infection where she pretty much slept for 2 whole days. She also has Reactive Airway Disease which is basically asthma induced colds, which she has at this moment along with stomach pains. So I can't send her to school when she has difficulty breathing or bent over in pain. Which is what I reiterated. 

The Assistant principal didn't really seem to care about anything we said and was just concerned about her being at school daily. And showed us some chart about certain races and disabled kids missing school. Im sure he had to have his talking points according to the state. He asked if she was doing well in school or if teachers had any concerns. She is a great student, never has had issues learning and is exactly where she needs to be. All her teachers always have great things to say. I asked him what I should do and should I just send her to school sick to infect her class mates. He had no answer, just not to send her to school with communicable diseases or green snotty nose running or with a fever. I know the school loses money if students are absent (we’re in CA)and he said that, so I felt like my child is just a $$$ sign to them. They dont care if my child is sick or healthy. 

  
I really dont want to deal with the school sending me letters or have to attend a SARB meeting for my sick child. I guess I will just have to keep getting doctors notes if I ever had to attend a SARB meeting for my child, bc I dont know what else to do. They really need to change their school policies/laws. This is a very anxiety inducing issue for me. I try my best, but the school does not care. Its a lose/lose situation for me I feel like. Send my sick child to school and feel guilty or keep her home to rest and the school has an issue with it. ",2024-11-12 20:11:39

I know that it’s normal for 3 year olds to have tantrums about not getting their way, but he doesn’t just have a tantrum. He screams at the top of his lungs and throws things. He also just doesn’t listen. I told him to stop jumping from the couch to the recliner about 5 times, he kept doing it, so he had a 3 minute time out. When I got him out of time out, and he was calmer, I tried to explain that I don’t tell him not to do things because I don’t want him to have fun. I tell him not to do things because it’s not safe. The whole time I was explaining that to him, or trying, he was just talking about other stuff and trying to leave so he could go play. Eventually I did get him to agree to listen better on the condition we could watch Spiderman (We usually don’t let him watch it because he tries to do flips off the couch and be Spiderman.) We went back downstairs, and the first thing he did was break a pair of glasses and jump from the couch to the recliner. Now he’s just screaming “F*ck you, b*tch!” over and over. I know for a fact he only knows those words from his aunt, because I’ve never cursed in front of him (besides calling someone an asshole in the car, but that was when he was a lot younger.) 
I worked at a daycare for about a year, in the two year old class. Of course, I saw a LOT of tantrums and meltdowns, but when I told them they needed to listen to me, they usually would. I was able to calm them down and get through to them. Maybe it's because I was their teacher and not their parent, but he is the complete opposite. 
He ate a quesadilla about half an hour ago, so he's not hungry. He's not sick, and he shouldn't be tired. We went outside earlier and played until he got tired, so he probably doesn't have pent up energy. It is so hard for me to be around him all day long because of the constant screaming.

Every time he's teething, he refuses any formula/breastmilk. I've tried straw cup, sippy cup, regular cup, spoon, syringe, iced teether, EVERYTHING. 

He'll go through this phase for a week then he'll go back to finishing bottles like a champ for awhile then back to refusing. This current phase feels like the worst of it because before he'll at least drink whole bottles in the evening now its a battle to get him to drink any of his bottles. He eats solids well but at most he consumes a quarter cup of food so I don't think I'm overfeeding solids.

We already saw his pediatrician last week and she suggested making the formula bottles denser and scheduled him a dietician appointment. I'm trying not to worry too much since he's still so active and happy (when I'm NOT trying to give him formula lol) but I hate feeling like I'm not doing enough.

The one thing I haven't tried is changing formula  since he has consistently gone back to wanting formula again. Considering this is his worst aversion phase so far, part of me is worried he just doesn't like the taste now. Is it worth switching formula even though he'll start weaning next month?

I want to start off by saying I’m not a regretful parent. I absolutely adore my son and it’s hard as everything is, I would never not want him in my life.  But my goodness life is so fucking hard right now. My son has just turned 12 months old in (two weeks ago), and it just feels like a never-ending slog of hard.

I had a really horrible pregnancy, 14 weeks of non-stop nausea. Thankfully, I didn’t have HG my poor sister-in-law had, but I had nausea all day and I was absolutely miserable. After a couple of weeks of feeling okay, I then had non-stop insomnia for the rest of my pregnancy, along with a host of other symptoms. 
And then had a somewhat traumatic birth which ended in an emergency C-section, the absolute opposite of what I had hoped the birth would be.

My son then spent eight days in the neonatal ward due several birth complications. This was incredibly distressing and I’m not sure if I’ve fully processed it yet. When we finally got him home, we had such a difficult two months of newborn phase, due to what we finally figured out to be several food intolerances, which had caused him to be incredibly unsettled all the time. It was an incredibly dark period of my life and at times I wondered if I’d made the right decision. 

Things got a bit easier at times, and of course there are happy and joyful times. But recently it’s been getting so hard again. My son whines almost all day, most days. I try so many things (taking him outside, water play, to different rooms, to the shops / out somewhere, singing songs, sensory play, etc etc) and yet he still shines SO MUCH. It’s so upsetting and stressful to me, especially as I’m trying so hard to be a good mum. 

My marriage is on the rocks. We used to be great, now we argue pretty much every day. I’ve contemplated divorce so many times this past year. My husband is a good man, a good and hands on father, but the expectations for fathers and mothers are on such a different level. We’re both had therapy to help us deal with everything that’s happened, and we’re both on medication, but we’re still struggling so much. 

We have no support. All of our family and friends are on the other side of the world. We’ve tried to get a baby sitter but no luck so far. We are pretty burnt out. The only break each of us get is over the weekend when we each get a few hours to ourselves. 

I feel so depressed, drowning in the shit period of life right now. I’m hoping and praying that things will get better, but so far the last 2 years have been the hardest of my life, and even though my son is worth it, I wonder for my sanity how long I can carry on like this. 

So I guess my question is when did things get better for you if you had a difficult baby? ",2024-11-12 03:43:01

The boy's parents take free-range parenting approach. They've already booked the apartment and are totally at ease with the teens being unsupervised. I'm more cautious. While I've previously expressed not wanting my daughter to be sexually active yet, I'm now wrestling with how firm to be on that stance, recognizing I can't completely control her choices. She's not on birth control, and she's still a virgin.

I believe there are also some gender dynamics at play here. His parents may view this differently because he's male, perhaps even taking pride (consciously or not) in giving their son freedom for independence and potential romance.

* able to download content versus having to buy add-ons physical titles (like with Tonies or Yoto or Moonlite) 
* preferably standalone rather than an attachment for a cell phone

Nice to have:
* ability to do lights for either a starry night effect or dance party

Ideally, it’d be a small near-indestructible cube where a narrator with a nice voice reads aloud a story with images during the narration, either like an old-timely cartoon or completely still images, not like a movie.

Posting anonymously to protect child. I am reaching out for help. I have two children, my youngest child does not have any hygiene or incontinence issues. My older child is the one not using the bathroom properly. We are of the gentle parenting style, we do not and will not use physical abuse.

He has been seen by doctor, xray found his bowels were compacted from him holding it in, and a fiber supplement was given which is helping to regulate his stool.

He is in occupational therapy as well as psychotherapy.

**Schedule:**  
Mon-fri - 7-9am on tech, eats breakfast, brush teeth, 9am-4pm at school, 4-9pm on tech, showers every other day.

Sat-sun – mostly on tech the entirety of weekend.

**Facts:**  
He has had this issue for the past 3 years.

He can feel it and knows that he needs to go. Even when urinating, he holds it to the last second and often holds the tip to prevent leakage.

He holds it until his body eventually pushes it out which leads to poo in his underwear. This rubs off on his bedding and our living room furniture. We have gotten pink eye in the past due to this.

He hides his dirty underwear(under sink, in closet, under dressers) even though over the last year we have been asking him to just throw them away in the rubbish bin.

**Final straw:**  
He had a sleepover with his best mates, and while they were here he had poo in his pants 4 times in 24 hours. He has had sleepovers before and this issue hasn’t happened.

We tried diligently hard to keep him from embarrassing himself, but his one friend said “I smell poo, its  \_son’s\_name \_”. We pulled him aside immediately and let him take his tablet to the bathroom to poo, and then shower before returning to his get together. He didn’t poo, he wiped what poo had seeped out and them showered. This happened again and again throughout the sleepover.

Questioned him about it after they left, and he replied that he “didn’t want to miss out on the fun and leave his friends”. We are concerned about the potential effects of bullying should this become common knowledge at his public school.

**Conclusion:**

Has anyone else been through this before? What else are we supposed to be doing?

My son just turned 2 a few weeks ago. At his 18 month checkup the doctor was concerned because he does not point, or do things that signify 'joint attention.' He did not babble much as a baby but he does speak, says lots of words but rarely says mama or dada. He rarely claps or waves. A few signs point to autism. A lot of things not- eye contact, smiles, laughs, plays with big sister) I understand it's a spectrum for that exact reason. I have people in my family saying he is so smart, no way, you're overreacting, he's just a toddler! But I know so many people who's toddlers don't act this way. Hence reddit, I'd like some confirmation or not, just your experiences, is constantly crying and whining, sometimes for no reason at all, normal? I'm aware this is a toddler, 2 year old we are talking about, but when taking him outside even fails, tickles, jumps up in the air and whirling him around (things he usually loves) don't work, and he's miserable and cranky most of the morning, after his nap for a long time, and then screams when it's bed time, I can't help but think he is frustrated because he can't communicate. Is this just yet another stage? Has anyone dealt with this and their kids just outgrew it? Or did it turn out to in fact be a developmental disability? I should also note that we are having a speech evaluation done because while he does say words, none of it is social like bye bye dada or hi mommy, it's repeating uh oh, oh no, thank you, but when I say to him 'tell Mimi thank you!' he will not/can not repeat it. Like to use language appropriately. The new addition (for the last month at least) of the constant whining and crying has me just overwhelmed, overstimulated, and at my wits end. My husband is upset with me because he thinks I have made up my mind, and that I need to calm down until we get a formal diagnosis, if anything is wrong. He keeps saying that we should have our son in full-time daycare to alleviate the stress on me, and give him more social interaction. If our son is autistic, is daycare even an option? I just don't know. He has always cried when we tried to leave him in the nursery at church, in a room with a lot of people, and he is very clingy.

I’m looking for some experience stories from people who have travelled (5 hour flight) abroad with their 13 month old.

My parents and grandparent think it is a great idea for myself, husband, Lo and my mum and dad to share an airBnB abroad for a week or 2. It should be a pool holiday.

I keep hearing horror stories and my family just keep telling me “other people do it” “you won’t get anywhere if you don’t try”.

My baby is 6 months old at the moment and he is quite difficult. He needs constant attention and will only nap on me. I can’t see how this will work on a flight and living outside our home.

Does anyone have positive stories going abroad at this age?",2024-11-12 01:32:32

My son was raised in two family households, great coparenting, and around extended families on both side. This is his norm for him but lately he has been questioning our r/ship assuming we are married. 

First time, it caught me off guard (we were in the elevator) and I told him we are not married nor he is my boyfriend. He asked how did you create me then, I said we were but not anymore. Second time, I brushed it off. 

Since i have a great r/ship with his dad, he is under assumption that we are husband and wife. I’m wondering if I should take time to explain things to him or let it go for now. 

Lately, his dad has been coming home and visiting him more often since my parents are on extended vacation. He sees us together more than ever. I’m thinking to cut that so that I don’t give my son  a mixed signal. I’m not in a serious in r/ship right now but I’m dating. I hope to get married soon and start my own family. If I allow it, his dad wants to get back together but I made it clear that I’m done. 

Shed some light since I’m confused and want to handle this the best way possible.

parenting,1gpoyli,Threat to throw away toys as punishment? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpoyli/threat_to_throw_away_toys_as_punishment/,19,"My kid has never been great abouy eating fruits and vegetables. In fact, they have a gag reflex for most things green and sometimes they end up throwing up. 

This morning we sliced up a banana in their food. They understandably had a negative reaction. My wife's reaction to this was to threaten to throw away her favorite toys if she didn't eat the entire banana quickly. I personally just want my kid to get used to eating fruits so my parenting style is to eat as much as they can and actually try. If they're full after half a banana, so be it but at least they tried it. 

My wife wanted the kid to take big bites and eat the entire thing very fast. On the way to school, my kid asked me to tell her mom to not force her to eat so fast next time because it made her tummy hurt. 

I've expressed that this is f'd up to my wife before and she tells me that she knows more about parenting than me because she babysat and was a nanny when she was a teenager. (I grew up with a huge family with lots of younger cousins and helped take care of kids all throughout my childhood. I also babysat quite a bit in my teenage years, so I'm not exactly new to taking care of a kid).

My question is, is threatening to throw away toys as f'd up as I think it is and to force a child to eat their fruit when they're so clearly not hungry anymore? My parents forced me to be part of the clean plate club as a kid and I'm still struggling with food issues well into my adult years and I don't want to put my kid through it. I think carrot not stick and threatening to throw away our kids toys will just lead them to not trust and resent us. ",2024-11-12 16:39:29

He rides the bus for an hour each way everyday and has been having a horrible time. He keeps standing and walking around, he makes a mess with his lunch, he hits other kids when they annoy him (the driver says he never starts anything but starts the physical fighting). We’ve recently gotten into arguments with the driver because he handed us a bag of garbage that was obviously not just my son’s things. 
We’ve tried everything. Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcing with things taken away, story time with people behaving on the bus, stories of kids misbehaving and the consequences. Setting goals. We even gave him a switch to go on the bus to give him something to do. But he lost it in a week (I think another kid stole it but we have no evidence and my son refuses to say anything about it). 
He has had natural consequences, like whacking his head, scuffing up his chin ect. 
There’s now talks about getting him kicked off the bus permanently. 
I’m completely at a loss. We’re in the process of getting him on medication, but the doctors are hesitant on medicating him and want him in counselling. 
I’m fighting for the medication but it feels like it’ll be too late before he gets kicked off the bus. 
I can’t drive him to school, it’s 40 minutes away, and I work full time without the ability to quit or change my hours. 
I’m at which a loss of what to do. I’m so overwhelmed. 
The school is suggesting he goes to a school more local to us, which isn’t as good of an education and we switched to this one as the school is better at supporting him, they have smaller class sizes, better educational assistance and in general he’s doing a lot better in this school than his last school. 
My son is smart, he’s in gr 1 reading at a great 4 level, he’s doing math at a grade 3 level, he’s just having issues on the bus. The local school is a walk away but their class sizes are in the 30s. He use to be sent home every day by lunch for destroying the classroom or doing other things. He’s run away from his old school because they were unable to properly supervise him and he climbed over the fence. (I don’t blame the teachers the lack of funding in my area is the issue) 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
Except spankings or beating my son. I refuse to abuse him in anyway.

Looking for thoughts on melatonin use, and advice on allowing her to just stay awake until she’s sleepy? 

I’m asking here instead of peds because the last time I asked this question (2-3 years ago) at a check up, they charged me $400 for a “behavioral assessment” when they did absolutely no assessing. I explained the problem and they said “🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s a toddler thing” and moved on. I was livid when I got the bill 😂 

5 year old daughter has always had trouble sleeping. She sleeps through the night most nights but it’s the getting down part that is incredibly difficult for her. 

Ex: she doesn’t fall asleep until midnight and then is up by 6:30am. If she goes to sleep by 8, she’s up anywhere between 3-5am for the day, and she can run on no nap. Lord help me on the days she DOES nap, then she’s not down until 10-11pm and still wakes around 5-6am. It’s like her body won’t let her sleep for more than 6-7 hours. 

My issues are:
1. I feel like this is incredibly unhealthy for her. She doesn’t get cranky or moody with the lack of sleep. She’s a really happy and SUPER energetic kid, like too energetic most days
2. I’m exhausted. I can’t fall asleep until she does because she will leave her room to wander the house or play with her toys or turn on the tv. The toys thing would be fine except she doesn’t just go to bed. She will just stay awake and play
3. I feel SOOOO guilty when she’s laying in her bed for hours upon hours because she just can’t fall asleep. She’s had the same bedtime routine since I brought her home from the hospital. I’ve tried switching it up over the years but she’s very particular so we stick with it

There is a negative stigma surrounding melatonin for kids her age so I don’t use it but I’m wondering if I should. Thoughts?

When she comes out and tells me she can’t sleep and she’s not tired, should I let her independently and quietly play? Or should I force her to remain in her bed? I don’t know. ",2024-11-12 15:40:36

He’s made a lot of progress, and I’m feeling uncertain about his current special ed program.

Last year, I was told he had verbal peer models in his class, but I later learned that most of his classmates were nonverbal. After many questions and hounding on my part, he has been moved to a different class with verbal peers, and it seems to be helping. However, only a month into the school year, his teacher has already suggested he’ll need a self-contained sped class for kindergarten due to behavior issues like trouble sitting still, following directions, and trying to make his classmates laugh—though academically he’s on target.

They also recommended summer school to maintain his progress, but we chose to keep him home, and he made great progress on his own. Currently, he attends five days a week, three hours a day, in a state-funded program, but I’m concerned he’s being “written off” without considering other environments where he might thrive.

It caused butt rashes that then made him even more fearful of pooping. He goes to school but won’t be able to attend next year if we don’t figure this out. 

Does anyone have any success stories and just tell me what to do. I’ll even do the soft poop route again if someone can give me guidance on how to get past that.

my daughter is nine months old and although i work on signing and speaking with her : she hasn’t really caught on. which is totally fine : i love watching grow at her own pace. 
THE PROBLEM: 
as of a month ago my sweet precious angel baby has begun to SCREAM. while sitting in her car seat the entire ride, when i walk out of the room, when she just wants attention or anything in general. i’m quite a patient mama , i can handle the screaming it doesn’t make me angry or anything. but i want to help my daughter learn that is not our inside voice and that we absolutely do NOT scream when we want things.
so far i just talk to her “ i know you don’t want to be in your car seat but we’re almost home it’s okay!!” “mommy has to go out the laundry up- i will be right back!!” “mommy and daddy are talking you need to wait until we’ve finished.” now obviously this does not work she will literally scream at me while i’m saying these things. i feel guilty if she’s screaming bc she dropped a toy and i get it for her: although i speak “baby it’s okay- you just dropped it we don’t need to scream mommy will get it for you” when i put it in her hands i feel as if im making the screaming okay since she does not really understand my words. 

is this the age im supposed to reprimand her? like nipping it in the bud before its too late.. or is there nothing i can do besides what i am doing. she’s an only child and she gets a lot of attention as it is (basically constant attention). so i need advice on how to react and what to do..  this is my first reddit post so i hope i did this right lol ",2024-11-12 13:23:27

And let me know if you think this is just being three or… I don’t know some kind of larger issue. 

1. Getting dressed. He HATES getting dressed. This ruins our day every morning and evening. Depending on how much time we have, sometimes I have to manhandle his limbs in to the clothes and it just feels awful. I’ve tried most things like setting a timer, getting him to choose the clothes, making it a game, giving him something interesting to look at whilst dressing etc. it never lasts. 

2. Food. He is so picky, his favourite foods are plain rice and plain Greek yoghurt, and sometimes he won’t even have those. For dinner we will serve him what we are having (anything from beef stew to risotto to pizza) with a side of Greek yoghurt, and often recently he will go to bed having eaten nothing whatsoever. 

3. Walking. He is a very active child, who enjoys playing outside / going to the park etc. but when it comes to walking to/ from school or the supermarket or whatever, he will not walk. He will have a tantrum on the pavement or carpark until me or my husband pick him up and carry him. This has also recently started extending to refusing to walk to the toilet from the living room, when he needs to go for a wee. 

4. Hitting and scratching. We play quite a lot and encourage rough and tumble to burn off energy, but this ALWAYS results in him scratching us as hard as he can with our nails, or hitting us, and then the fun stops. It’s horrible. 

5. Doing the opposite of what he’s asked. If he can sense that we need him to do something, he is almost guaranteed to do the opposite. 

To be clear, I love him dearly and obviously would throw myself in front of a speeding train for him, and we have absolutely no issues from preschool / socially etc. I think everyone generally considers him to be a pleasant child, but these things he does specifically to me, at home, drive me ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

I had my daughter when I was 19 and in an abusive relationship which ended shortly after she was born and have struggled with panic disorder, agoraphobia, and severe depressive episodes since. The combination of these things and how they've affected my ability to parent really makes me feel like I suck as a mom in certain ways. I know I've succeeded in being kind, supportive, and teaching her to better regulate herself based on things I've learned in my own therapy sessions as it shows in her behavior and self-esteem. But I really struggle to be a hands-on mom, to find the energy to be fully present, and frankly I feel like I still have no idea what I'm doing, as a mom or as an adult in general, despite now being 29 and having a child nearing middle school.

My daughter is autistic, her interests are almost entirely a select few video games, youtubers, and science (particularly outer space). She doesn't seem to like doing arts and crafts at home, I'm a portrait artist so I have definitely tried this area. The games she likes she plays on her switch and I really can't afford to get a new gaming device to play along. I've tried reading together, board games (we have both easy to play games and ones that are more complicated but are themed around her special interests), sensory based play like slime or play doh. The problem is she always gets so bored and clearly just wants to stop and go back to doing something else. She doesn't like watching movies anymore. She usually won't read unless she's reading on her own. I don't know what we can do together and my budget is unfortunately super limited.

I want my daughter to feel more secure, and her life feel more structured. Which is hard to do when i myself am just starting to get my feet back on the ground. I'm sure i'm not the only one, but sometimes you see other parents and realize very quickly, this person knows what the hell they're doing and is clearly better at this than i am. I don't want to fail my daughter or her to struggle one day because of me. She is SUCH a good kid, she is so sweet and silly and kind and confident. Please advise. Thank you

My grandparents had me 90% of my parents time that they were supposed to be with me!(both sets) 😂 

Then they tell us to have babies. Promise to help. Want us to get them grandchildren and when we do they are no where to be found. They’re living their lives. Which is cool and all. Whatever. But don’t act like you’re gonna help and then act like you never said it. 

My issue is these kids have certain holidays off of school that I have NEVER heard of. So many days off for parent teacher conferences, etc. 

On of my family members is very close to us and isn’t even working right now! I offered to pay her. I only need help with two half days. Three hours each day and I’m good. I told her after that it’s just regular holidays so I don’t need help until after February and there’s only a few days in there I would need help. I asked her to let any jobs know these specific dates she would need off or switched around in the schedule. Again, I’m offering to pay her over her regular wage and she just says ‘no’…. Okayyyyy. So fuck me then I guess. 

I wonder what it was like to always have parents to hand off your kids to? Must have been so easy. 

Edit:

I’m seeing these comments calling me ‘spoiled’ trust and believe my mother abandoned me in childhood. Even in adulthood she’s abandoned me several times. I’m upset because she promised she could help me on these certain days. She is the one that called me but now she’s switching it up. I even was paying her MORE than her regular work wage. Like I asked for help on three half days in the next 5 months and I’m…. Spoiled?… for that? After a childhood of abuse and addiction from her? For asking her to keep her word? I never ask her for anything. This was all I asked of her. And number one she told me ‘ if you need help just ask’ okay…. I asked… you said yes… now your backing out and my jobs gonna be at risk. Any sane person would feel upset by this. Especially because she ASKED ME WHAT SHE COULD DO TO HELP. Tf? I have never asked her for anything because she always backs out. She begged me to give her something… this was it. But sure, whatever you say. I’m so fucking spoiled 😂

She's our second so we aren't just unfamiliar with the new (lack of) sleep schedule of being parents. She has maybe slept more than 4 hours straight only a couple times in her whole life. Obviously early on she was being fed every 2-3 hours but that was only a couple months. Thing is, she just wakes up and there are only two ways to get her to not cry: wife feeds her or I walk around with. Even those things dont guarantee much. She is clearly at least partially angry that she's awake because she falls back asleep pretty hard. Something just triggers her to wake up all the dang time. Even just tonight she fell asleep ~1 hours ago and has already woken up fussing 2 times and if one of us doesn't feed/hold her, it's going to be a screamfest. 

We've talked to the doctors about it this whole time and done almost everything under the sun. My wife has cut out dairy to help with gas, we have the same bedtime routine, we have a very dark room, we have tried all the settings on the sound machine, it's been cold and hot, etc etc and we're just coming up with nothing. 

Similarly, she has scream-cried for about 90% of the time she's ever been in the car. We've had two different car seats, tried the different angles, given her toys, tried different music, drive fast, drove slow, etc. and still she hates every second. Part of it is that she definitely doesn't like being messed with/restricted. Like she hates getting her clothes changed. She's still never been in a stroller for more than 10 minutes because she hates it 

And it's kind of crazy because otherwise she's a very happy baby. She's a bit high maintenance and quick to whine/fuss but nothing over the top EXCEPT these things

We get along great and I like her a lot. She has a son from a previous relationship.

Yesterday, a few of us stayed behind to deep clean our church. My daughter (5) was running around playing with 2 other girls. Now I’ll admit, my daughter is pretty energetic and hasn’t been listening well. But her and the other girls were playing with the blankets we keep on the back of pews. 

I told my daughter to clean up anything she got out and a few moments later I heard my SIL snapping at her telling her to put the blankets up NOW. 

Later that evening my husband asked if I thought SIL was being harsh on our daughter. I said I only saw that once instance and asked what he saw. 

He said the kids found a sealed pack of Easter eggs and asked him if they could open it. He said no. Later on my daughter asked someone else if she could open it and SIL snapped saying she had already been told no, DON’T LIE. 

Further, my husband said that on a few occasions in the past SIL has complained about her son’s interactions with our daughter saying “he just follows her around like a puppy” and frequently telling her son “you don’t have to listen to her”, “stop listening to her”, and “she’s not your boss”. 

I try not to be biased, but it genuinely seems like my daughter kinda acts like the leader and isn’t being bossy. But I don’t know what it looks like from an outsiders perspective. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? Do we keep a better eye on daughter to make sure she’s playing nice/listening or is this something to bring up to SIL? ",2024-11-11 18:06:10

She primarily lives with myself, my spouse/her dad (30M), & our 2 year old son. I’ve been in her life since she was 3. We have a strong bond & I am an active parent in her life. 
She was given an iPhone by her bio mom. We have significant parental controls set up. No social media, limited screen time, etc. 
Our daughter made this friend from school who she texts frequently. We monitor conversations & have been uneasy with the friend. We also found out that the friend was previously expelled from school. 
We have put off ending this friendship for a handful of months now. We wanted our daughter to learn discernment & make the choice to distance herself from this friendship on her own. 

Unfortunately a recent event has shown us that our daughter is too influenced by this friend. She made a choice that not only broke our phone rules, but also could have gotten her in significant trouble at school for bullying. This choice was made at the encouragement of the friend. Our daughter is in control of her actions & has earned herself some consequences for her behavior, but it’s clear to us that this friend is a bad influence & we’re at the point where we need to intervene. 

My question: what’s the best way to go about this? Our daughter will undoubtedly be upset to lose this friendship, which we’re prepared to support her through. I’m concerned about approaching this in a way that won’t result in our daughter becoming a target for this soon-to-be ex-friend. My spouse & I have never been through this before, & we were never forbidden from certain friends by our parents when we were kids ourselves. I’m at a loss on how to handle this. 

TLDR: We are going to tell our 11 year old that she cannot continue a friendship with a bad influence any longer & are unsure the best way to go about it. ",2024-11-11 19:08:24

TLDR : I don't know how to motivate her to want to take interest in improving her life.  I feel resentful because she is stubborn and I am hating her life choices. 

My wife (45) and I (47) adore our daughter (16) and have always strived to provide her with the best life we can, within our means. She is our youngest child; her brother, who is 11 years older, is from a previous relationship on my wife's side. We live in a comfortable middle-class neighborhood where she has her own room and every convenience she could need. She attends an all-girls private school, and we’ve consistently encouraged her to socialize and spend time with friends. She has also had the chance to travel and experience other cultures. Two years ago, we sent her and her brother to visit her aunt in the Middle East, where her aunt is working, and next year, as part of her senior year curriculum, she'll be traveling to Paris.

To support her transition into high school, we arranged for her to meet with a psychologist, not only to help with academic pressures but to give her guidance from someone she could relate to culturally. This has been especially important as we come from a mixed background, and we want her to feel secure in her social identity. The psychologist is a woman with a similar cultural background, making it easier for our daughter to open up and feel understood.

Academically, we’ve provided additional resources as well. We found a tutoring center nearby that offers support to students in her school, and we’ve arranged transportation for her so she doesn’t have to spend hours waiting at school. Her driver either takes her to tutoring and then home, or directly home, ensuring her time is spent purposefully.

Outside of academics, we’ve bonded over shared activities. I’ve introduced her to reading, anime, and video games, while she and her mother often watch movies and series together, whether it’s in the bedroom or the family room. When she had to prepare for a school camp at the start of high school, I made sure she was fully prepared. We even hiked together every Sunday morning for months to build up her fitness and confidence for the trip.

Our hope is for her to put her best effort into her studies. We want her to have the opportunity to attend university, earn a qualification, and build an independent, fulfilling life. We've sacrificed much of our own happiness and goals for her and her brother’s futures. I often say that I can’t retire because we’ve invested so much in giving them the lives they have now. I don’t expect anything in return, other than for them to be happy, fulfilled, and financially independent.

Yet, despite her intelligence and potential, she has shown no interest in studying and firmly resists our encouragement. We’ve tried numerous ways to motivate her, but she seems set on a path that doesn’t prioritize education, and it’s concerning to watch her make these choices.

We’ve also limited her use of technology, emphasizing personal interactions over social media. She doesn’t have her own phone; instead, she uses a spare device, which we manage carefully to minimize exposure to online bullying and other risks. At one point, she became heavily invested in Character AI and started to rely on it obsessively, leading us to block it and limit her internet time further. She has even tried to bypass these restrictions using VPNs, showing the extent of her attachment to the digital world.",2024-11-12 10:59:11

My wife(23F) and I(24M) have our son, we will call him Adam (2). She refuses to discipline or show any boundaries to our son. She gets upset with me when I raise my voice even slightly to get across the point that when I say no, it means no, and after Mayne 30-40 seconds of him crying she will cave in and give him what he wants every time. I know he's only two, but that doesn't stop us from teaching him what No and Yes mean, or that boundaries are important. She claims that she wants to gentle parent but what she's doing is more permissive parenting in my eyes. I just need some help in how to discuss it with her and how to move forward. 

P.s. I am by no means a perfect parent, I do raise my voice and yell (even though I know I shouldn't, he's only two). I try, but I was spanked growing up and it's how I always planned to raise my own kids, but she talked me into attempting the gentle parenting thing, but this seems more like letting your kid run the house.

The way he expresses those feelings is objectively horrific. About 1x a week he has big tantrums. We’re working on this w a professional. 

However I also want to reinforce this with books. 

We have “hands are not for hitting” we also have a few books about emotions but I would like some more specifically he does not understand boundaries and he gets extra frustrated when told No. 

He has them at home but it’s pretty minimal - his big chair throwing tantrums happen at Preschool. 

Part of this is because at home I don’t actually tell him No. I simply talk around it.

I asked him to help me clean up he said why dont u ask grandma 
I told him we have to let her rest she is tired
He said
“She can rest when she dies”
Now he says things like
“Will u be sad if i die?”
“Will anyone remember me?”
“How many lives i have?”

I decided today to cut the milk cold turkey  only giving a cup at nap and bedtime. It's now almost bed time and she has barely eaten all day. Maybe a strawberry, a couple nachos, a bit of cheese, and licked some peanut butter off a spoon. I'm not going to give her milk tonight after she goes to bed.

These companions can act as educational tools, interactive tutors, and even virtual friends, helping kids learn and engage in a safe environment. From storytelling to language learning, AI companions for children are crafted to be friendly, engaging, and educational, making learning both enjoyable and interactive.

These AI companions can adapt to each child’s learning style, providing personalized lessons and answering questions in real time. For kids who may struggle with traditional learning methods, AI companions can offer a patient, non-judgmental space to explore topics. Moreover, these digital friends can help kids develop social skills through interactive storytelling, problem-solving, and guided conversations, laying a foundation for effective communication and empathy.

However, it’s essential to monitor how children interact with AI companions and ensure they don’t become overly reliant on them. Children are impressionable, and their understanding of relationships may be shaped by these interactions. Parents and educators need to guide children’s AI interactions and emphasize real-world friendships to ensure that AI companions complement rather than replace human connections. With the right balance, AI companions can be a valuable learning tool without overshadowing the importance of genuine social experiences.""",2024-11-12 09:57:22

So this is everything that happened, and I am proud and angry with my son, and I need help figuring out how to proceed. 

My 13 year old asked to sleepover at a friend's 2 nights ago. No problem. He has slept there many times before. 
All went well, and the next day the kids popped by to grab bikes and go for a ride. 

How it all started: 

Me ""you need to wear lights or reflective gear when biking.""

Him, No response.

Me ""be home by 4:30."" (which is before dark and because my teen knew we were having family over from 3-5 and the grandparents wanted to see him). 

Him ""ok""

I get a text after 4:30 saying he is on the way. Then I get a frantic call at 5:15 from my son saying his friend got hit by a car on their way home. 

- the rest of the night was spent rushing to the scene, taking the friend to ER and talking to the police - 

The friend is okay, but pretty bruised up (he was not wearing a helmet). 

It was at the scene of the accident that I found out that there were no adults at the sleepover house. The parents are out of the country and a teenage relative (who I have never met) was in charge of the house.

After our visit to the ER I met the cousin, grabbed everyone some late night eats and let my son stay the night with his injured friend. 

Now I am trying to figure out how to deal with this situation. 

Issues:

1) My son refused to wear reflective gear.

2) He did not come home before dark like we agreed on. 

3) He neglected to tell me that his friend's parents would not be home for the sleepover.

Proud moments:

1) My son wore his helmet and always does. 

2) He called for help.

3) He stayed with his friends and insisted the driver stay (elderly person who kept trying to leave the scene).

I feel there needs to be consequences, but he also did a lot right.

My son is turning 8, we're inviting some of the close friends from school for the party in a trampoline venue, definitely not all the class, but these invited are part of a group that generally hang out together .  


There's one kid in the group though who my son is not comfortable with. He's asking me to please not invite him as he is very annoying to my son (his words).

 My kid likes everyone and is very well liked, he even made friends with the one kid at school who tried to bully him. He doesn't complain much but this is the one kid he'll come home upset with , sometimes.  He is very loud and sometimes will poke him non stop during class,  and won't quit even if he says NO and tells the teacher.  He's also afraid the might hurt him during the party (he's big and rough and often hurts other kids, even though he never hurt mine). 

Another thing that bothers my kid is that he'll be on his face the whole time when they are at a friend's party/playdate and doesn't let the other friends get close and play too. 

For my part, I'm disgruntled that this kid has also been VERY nasty to my other kids too,  making them cry in a previous birthday we invited him to, and a party at his house we've been invited to. 


I feel awful excluding the one kid in the group,  I know it's not his fault he's like that and it's not malicious (he  has ADHD and also adores my kid, his parent says) but I also think it's my boy's special day and I don't want him to not enjoy his party. I also feel bad since my kid was always invited to this kid's parties before. Ugh. 😞

I know the parent and there's ZERO chance he'll tell the kid to behave, they are very hands off and on several occasions refused to even talk to the boy after he pushed or hit another boy badly during our get togethers. They just smile and hug their son and say nothing about his behaviour, so I don't think taking to him beforehand would help. People gloss over too but he's already starting to not being invited as much as he pushed both birthday boy and his mom the last party he attended. 
 
What to do?? Bite the bullet and upset the kid by not inviting him but protect my son's enjoyment of his party? Or include him and tell my kid to suck it up and maybe it won't be too bad?  I feel awful with both options, honestly. ",2024-11-11 22:55:18

Also during this time frame when we would talk about what we were going to do the next day and school was brought up she says things like ‘no mommy I stay with you, please don’t leave me, I don’t want to go’ etc. So it was shocking on Friday when my sweet baby girl tells her daddy and I that she wants to die.

I never thought of all the parenting things this would be one id post about but life is crazy.

I grew up super rational with atheist , unsuperstitious parents… the kind who look down on people who are religious or superstitious.

I don’t appreciate their level of judgement against others but I definitely inherited a tendency to be firmly in the realm of the physical and scientifically explainable.

Somehow my soulmate and husband turned out to be someone who grew up with superstitious parents who believe in ghosts and the evil eye and such stuff. 

I never minded it before as I thought it balanced out my rigor on these things. It taught me to be less condescending and self-congratulatory the way my parents are which I’m grateful for.

However, I was away on a work trip that coincided with the day-after-Halloween.. and it appears my husband has told our three year old son that ghosts are, in fact, real. 

I found myself deeply uncomfortable with this.. my little one has mentioned it to me twice .. the first time was before I fully understood his father’s message to him.. and I spontaneously said “they’re not real people just like to imagine and tell stories about spooky things on Halloween for fun , and we put up ghost decorations for fun too” .. and my husband said “yes but sometimes they’re real” .. which I thought was a joke ? So I sort of ignored him.. 

The second time the three year old insisted his dad said it and I just said “my mom and dad told me they’re not real and I always knew them only in stories, never in real life.. but maybe baba thinks they’re real, and that’s ok.” 

But I’m genuinely questioning the decision behind telling a child that they’re real.. is this recommended? I feel like this is the sort of thing someone should arrive to on their own like spirituality and other more esoteric things.. not something we parents should set the tone for ourselves?

I’m struggling really bad with breastfeeding. I’m not producing enough milk. I went to a lactation consultant for help and was advised that if I wanted to have any chance at breastfeeding I needed to feed her every 3 hours around the clock for 10 min on each side and then pump for 15 min after every time plus an hour of power pumping to get my supply up. I don’t feel like I can handle all that whatsoever and keep thinking about giving up and just giving formula but everything about that makes me feel like she’s going to be worse off and like I’m not doing a good enough job. She just takes so long to feed just to never be satisfied and it’s draining me.

I’m still trying to wrap my head around what happened, and I’m honestly not sure how to proceed.

Yesterday, I got a call from the daycare around noon. They said my son had a “minor accident” but that he was fine and didn’t need medical attention. When I picked him up, his teacher explained that he had been playing on the playground when one of the other kids pushed him off the slide. He landed on his back and got the wind knocked out of him.

When I got him home and looked him over, I noticed a pretty big bruise forming on his lower back and some scratches on his arm. He seemed okay, but he kept saying, “No more slide, Mama,” over and over, and it broke my heart. He’s normally such a fearless little guy, but now he won’t even talk about the playground without looking scared.

I know kids can be rough with each other, but I can’t shake the feeling that this could’ve been prevented. I asked the daycare director if they had enough staff supervising, and they assured me they do, but it still doesn’t sit right with me.

Should I be pushing harder for answers? Is this just one of those things that happens with toddlers, or should I be more concerned about how the daycare is handling it? I don’t want to be *that* parent, but I also don’t want my son to be in an unsafe environment.

parenting,1gpe52p,i think my son might have anxiety but i don’t know where to start,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpe52p/i_think_my_son_might_have_anxiety_but_i_dont_know/,1,"I’m \[F34\], and I’ve started noticing some patterns in my son \[M9\] that have me really worried. I think he might have anxiety, but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if this is something I should take more seriously.

Over the last year, he’s become increasingly nervous about things that never used to bother him. He constantly worries about being late, even if we’re leaving the house 30 minutes early. He double-checks his backpack every morning like he’s afraid he forgot something, even though we’ve been doing a checklist together.

The biggest red flag was last week. He had a small presentation at school—just a short “show and tell” thing, nothing major—and the night before, he was a wreck. He couldn’t sleep, kept pacing, and kept saying, “What if I mess up?” over and over. I tried to reassure him, but it didn’t seem to help.

Even at home, he’s been really jumpy and keeps biting his nails, something he’s never done before. I asked him if something was bothering him at school, and he insists everything’s fine, but his behavior says otherwise.

I’m completely lost on what to do. Is this just normal 9-year-old stress, or could it actually be anxiety? Should I talk to his pediatrician, or would that be overkill? I just want to help him before it gets worse.

Any advice from parents who’ve dealt with something like this would mean the world to me. I don’t want him to feel this way, but I don’t know what steps to take to support him.",2024-11-12 06:00:20
parenting,1gpe044,my son is being bullied at school and i feel helpless,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpe044/my_son_is_being_bullied_at_school_and_i_feel/,1,"My son \[M12\] has been coming home from school quieter than usual for the past few weeks, and I thought it was just him being a moody preteen. But last night, he finally broke down and told me everything—he’s being bullied by a group of kids at school.

They’ve been calling him names, mocking his appearance, and even pushing him around during recess. He tried to handle it on his own at first, which breaks my heart because he didn’t want to “bother” me or his mom with it. He said he was afraid that telling a teacher or an adult would just make it worse.

Hearing him describe what he’s going through absolutely crushed me. He’s such a good kid—kind, funny, and always trying to make others laugh. The thought of anyone making him feel like he’s less than that is unbearable.

I called the school this morning, but I’m already frustrated with their response. They said they’ll “look into it” and “monitor the situation,” but they didn’t seem very proactive. Meanwhile, my son is terrified to go back.

Parents, how do you deal with something like this? Should I push harder with the school? Do I teach my son to stand up for himself (even though he’s not a confrontational kid)? I just want to make this stop without making his life even harder.

If you’ve been through something similar, I’d really appreciate any advice or tips. I just want him to feel safe and happy at school again.",2024-11-12 05:51:00

He is under 2. Today he wanted to get up on a computer chair and wanted to be rolled around. He was huffing and puffing and I put him on the chair. My wife said “ you’re enabling the behavior” in a casual way. She wasn’t being blameful and it’s something we both do for our child. For me, it’s less about hating that he is upset or sad, but it’s more about how much I love seeing him excited and happy. He has the best laugh! So my first question is if there is a better way to do that and is it a big deal if we play/reward him if either of us want to play with him and he is acting like that? 


The second part is more straightforward. We are trying to teach him sharing and I tried to have him give up his computer chair seat so I could roll my wife around. He was having a full on tantrum about losing his turn. He use to be so good at sharing. How do I teach him better?",2024-11-12 05:42:01

I am angry everyday and irrationally so up until about 8pm where I am almost manually happy. I get debilitating tried between noon and 4pm to the point that I've closed my eyes and almost slept while walking down the street. I fight with my fiancé every day and seem to find new and creative ways to make him out to be the asshole without any provocation. I get depressed about 4pm and almost manic at 8pm. 

I can eat right, sleep 8 hours at night, not puke, and still becoming a whirlwind of illogical emotions. I've said awful things. I do awful things (walking away instead of talking it out in the middle of a conversation, leaving my fiancé in public spaces to just figure it out *we both use the bus to get around so he's not stranded, just alone*, and today I told him I hate him). I give conflicting information all the time. I forget what I say within 10 minutes and go back on my word, and insist I didn't say what I said. I am losing my mind, and my relationship. I am breaking myself. 

I need psych meds. At this point I feel like I need a psych hold but I would have no one to take care of my 9 month old as my fiance is currently unhoused and I'm in a women and children's house (Oxford House sobriety group home). These women can't take her for the duration I would need to stay on a psych hold to for treatment and at this point I need an anti-psychotic to level me off which cannot be done without compromising my pregnancy. 

I'm in a very dark place and am unaware of how to move forward in treating my issues. I know I need to talk to a doctor about my options but I'm afraid all there is for me is therapy which will not help when I'm having delusions. I need meds and I need them yesterday. By the time my baby is born I won't have a relationship. I'll have nothing. Be nothing. I won't have enough left of me for me or my children. 

If anyone has delt with this level of psychosis during pregnancy, what did you do and what meds did you take if any? What treatment is available? What is safe? 

Please, help. I'm out of spoons and have already damaged my relationship so much in the past month.This level of insanity only was present at the last ten days of my second pregnancy but it's been my entire experience so far.",2024-11-12 05:08:24

I am honestly at the end of my rope, it is non-stop and my family and husband are like ""its not that bad."" I walk away when she does it then she screams so much she can trigger an asthma attack -- she has chronic lung disease. So then I have to hold her and just take more kicks and hits. I ask over and over what I can help with or what she wants and then she just keeps hitting. Half the time she is laughing.

And its over nothing. Like changing diaper (which i give like a 10 minute warning for), the wrong shape cheese puff, going back inside, or when she is just bored. 

She has mild autism according to the doctor but she only does this with me so I dont know if its related. 

She ruins every moment, every outting but is stuck like glue to me. When someone takes over for me and I hide in my room, she screams at the door, kicks, hits and throws anything she can get her hands on.

I am stuck wondering when this is going to end because it am just breaking down.

UPDATE: Thanks for some of the comments - there was some great advice and support and some ... well... lets just say that a comment that simple says ""Just discipline her"" or ""Don't let her do that"" is just super embarassing for you. Bless your heart, may you receive the same useless advice that you give.

 I do have to note that I am trying to avoid hitting. My husband is very much against it. I was hit when I was younger and while I don't see a problem with occasionally spanking (like for trying to put a finger in a light socket), I am respecting my husband's literal one request on raising our child.

I did talk to him about how I feel like he is minimizing the issue and he apologized. He said he will actively take it more seriously and step in when he sees it. We are planning to call Early Intervention for advice and working on getting her services.

Some comments are completely skipping over the fact she has chronic lung disease (she was born at 25 weeks and was in the NICU for 6 months). I can't let her scream it out for physical reasons. For those that did consider that in their comment, very much appreciated and I shared them with my husband.

They wear the same clothes for a very long time, my daughter shops at second hand thrift stores, my son only wears cheap sweatpants and hoodies, I find it very weird, but when I ask them they just shrug. Are your zoomers the same?? Is it because they always had things and never faced any shortages of anything?

parenting,1gpb6gm,Succumbing to endless sleep deprivation and resulting anxiety - help! ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpb6gm/succumbing_to_endless_sleep_deprivation_and/,1,"Our 14-month-old is struggling with sleep and as a result so are we. In fact, struggling is probably an understatement. I will warn by saying this post may seem a little overdramatic but we are so sleep deprived and at our wits ends. Our child was never a “great” sleeper by any stretch, but there was a glimmer of hope around the 12-13 mark where he began sleeping through the night, or maybe having one wake up where he went back down pretty easily. Now, he is waking 2-3 times a night, but taking 1-2 hours (sometimes longer) to go back down. It’s the time its taking to go back to sleep that is the killer. When you add it all up, mum and dad are getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night.
 
We have tried so many things, initially we thought it was a regression or phase so we took shifts and tried to push through but its been a whole month with no sign of improvement and the taking shifts method is no longer working. Our house is small and when he is awake, no matter where you are or if you have earplugs or not, you can hear it. But also, the fact he takes 1-2 hours to go back down is too much to put on one person to do exclusively. We both work during the day. 

We have tried sleep training various methods but they don’t seem to work. They say “put them down when drowsy and not sleepy” but he just immediately starts crying loudly and gets himself all worked up and even more awake? I really don’t know how that works for other people? Am I missing something? The only thing that works is pacing the room and rocking him to sleep but as I said it takes so, so, so long, and sometimes he’s just awake again moments later. Everything I’m seeing online says toddlers should start sleeping through the night around this time but he’s doing anything but. We love him so much, but for me in particular, it causes immense, immense anxiety. Like it really gets to me. Night times is something I dread.

 I feel okay during the day and as night time gets closer I start to get more and more anxious as I worry about how the night will go. I’ve tried to change my mindset, to just “lean into it”, to go with the flow, to stay in the moment and not wish away the years, but I am genuinely starting to stress about when this will change? I go to bed the moment he does to try to maximise however much sleep I manage to get, but most of the time I just lie there anxious. Every cry that comes through the monitor sends panic through my body. I know that’s an over reaction but it’s just the visceral place I’ve found myself in after so many nights of sleep deprivation. 

How is it so many other people have a child that sleeps through the night at this age? How do we get it when sleep training and other things don’t seem to work? How do I manage my anxiety around this and not be filled with worry and panic all night? How do I focus on the belief that it will change and will get better when it doesn’t feel like it will? We always wanted two, but now the thought of having a newborn or doing this again fills me with anxiety as well. I can’t imagine getting past this stage only to do it again. I feel like we have no life anymore, our days are work, baby, then an anxiety filled night of little sleep, rinse and repeat. Sorry to be such a downer about a topic that I know has been brought up many times, but I feel so defeated and stressed out about the whole thing. 

Any success stories, tips, strategies or even just reassurance would be greatly appreciated. I knew there would be some sleep deprivation with having a baby but this is so much more than I ever anticipated. The lack of sleep and anxiety is seeping into every aspect of my life and making me feel like I can’t be as good a father as I need to be cause I’m always struggling with this. He was sick a lot recently and though he is thankfully better it was such a stressful time because I was trying to handle him being sick while being so stressed and sleep deprived myself and felt I just struggled every step of the way. How do I get a hold of this? I feel if he started sleeping through the night it would literally fix all problems.",2024-11-12 03:10:40

The little one ran out into the street right as a car was pulling into the street. All the nanny did was try to yell at her oldest to grab the kid but the oldest didn't or couldn't hear her. By the time she was done yelling, he was already in the middle of the road and the car had stopped. (Or I think it did, didn't really see tbh)

But I ran like heck to scoop up the LO and walked him back in the side walk next to her. I actually had to drop him real quick because mine started to try to run out as well. 

So obviously chaos. I'm always hyper aware. But all I could think of was, what if I wasn't there and the nanny just had those 3 by herself. She was tending to her own child in that moment. 

Do I say anything to my friend? Maybe it's a one off and the nanny did expect extra help since we're kind of used to tag teaming the kids. (Usually just the 2 instead of 4.) Maybe if I wasn't there, she wouldn't have gone on the walk without me? 

It's really kind of bothering me but I also don't want to stir up trouble or make things awkward. 

Should I give my friend a heads up, so she can ask the nanny not to take them out all at once if it happens again? Or am I overthinking it? ",2024-11-12 02:44:03
parenting,1gpamuo,Daughter shared dad smokes weed in front of her. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gpamuo/daughter_shared_dad_smokes_weed_in_front_of_her/,21,"I know it’s 2024 and the opinions on this subject are so all over the place. But tonight, my daughter shared that her dad and his girlfriend casually smoke pot from a bong in front of she and her sister. I wasn’t thrilled to hear this but my daughter said it doesn’t bother her except for the fact that he never use to do this. 

I am having mixed feelings about this because I am not anti weed by any means, but I personally don’t love the idea of using any sort of substances in front of my children. Weed, nicotine, alcohol, etc. I don’t want to normalize this sort of behavior for them. 

I fully recognize I can’t control what goes on there. I don’t think they’re in grave danger by any means but I am saddened to hear this is happening. 

For a little more context, I would say we coparent pretty well together. So on one hand I would like to bring it up to him, on the other, I don’t think it’s going to change anything so do I even bother? Is just making sure my stance as his coparent is known enough reason to share my concerns. 

Coparenting can be so hard to know when to just bite your tongue or when you say something as an advocate for your child. ",2024-11-12 02:42:10

I asked her daycare/school today if she throws fits like this at school and they said yes. They haven’t told me this until I ask them. They said they have a calm down corner for when the kids get mad and throw fits.

Hello! 

I had my daughter (3) in Arizona and the relationship got incredibly toxic and abusive that I came to visit my family in Florida and never looked back. It’s been 3 years. He has only fought with me and threatened us in our communication. 

Last time I spoke to him was about 6 months ago. He has not asked or tried to see her since she was 1yr old. 

How do I go about this? And if I DO what doors do I open bc I’d rather keep what I can shut with this man.

parenting,1gp012g,Tired of this life ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gp012g/tired_of_this_life/,6,"Male married to female with 2 kids  ( 8 and 6). 

One is ADHD and hard work. 
One is smart and even harder work. 

When the wife is there, it's just anger and agitation from her to the kids and then that gets to me and I swear her and then finally it can get sent toward the kids etc especially after they continue to challenge.

I know I am wrong to get to this state, but it appears it happens more when the wife is around. 

When it's just me and the kids, yeah sometimes its the drama but they listen and will be self sufficient and work as a team. When mum is around never happens often enough. 

Tonight I screamed at my 6 year old , who took 2 hours to eat and like a squirrel kept food in their cheeks. Then all we needed to do was brush teeth and go to bed. Another 20 mins of drama. I ended up spanking her on the bum.

Before that happened  the wife accuses me for not doing anything, though I had just earlier in the hour before also took over the homework of the 8 year old that she was supervising and stating to shout at as he was struggling and not getting some writing concepts. He was in tears so I got of the table and we went to another room and calmly got it it done with multiple attempts in any case. 

I am tired of this shit. I hate being angry , being the person I don't want to be , the anger in the house. It happens often enough that even my kids scream. This was not supposed to be on the plan. How did we get here. 

The best part is even sometimes when she is being really horrible (screaming /shouting) to them they will always take her side even when I try to help them.  They say they love me but I don't know how. I appear to only their friend when no other adults are around. 

I know my wife is super frustrated at me for not being at the earning level she is at. Money is not the most important thing for me. She says I am not driven enough. Perhaps if I got another job I would make more. 

Just to state that when wife was away for business trip for a 2 weeks last year, when left to our own devices, everything worked like a dream. No fights, arguments with the kids. Everything just went smoothly for 12 days. It was like a miracle. They took on responsibility, etc

As soon as she was back, they needed help to eat their food again and the anger and everything was back especially in me as I saw how the kids could be. 

Frankly, I am tired of trying to resolve this. I know I am not without fault, but I am just angry and feel useless. 

Thinking it's time to call it quits with the wife.

The kids having a broken family is the biggest and worst outcome but I am wondering if I am causing more harm by staying together .


It will impact me more as she earns more than me and her family support with the kids are amazing. My life could end up being a bit more complex as I will need to find a new place etc.

The fly in the ointment is we should also be moving countries because of my job , but I believe shifting us as a unit won't solve the problems unless us as parents change. I don't think we are capable of changing too much. 

And I don't want to be far away from my kids. I do want to continue to be a presence in their lives. But I want them to know me for me , yes I can be a super angry guy sometimes but normally am so meek. (Passive aggressive I guess).

But my mental health is at a breaking point. Just have apathy mostly with the family life. 

I need my kids to not be in an environment where the parents are arguing daily because they have really divergent viewpoints and definitely different approaches to parenting . 

I know my kids don't need mollycoddling and even with the ADHD kid, we can get routines that help him work better. 

This is not a cry for help. I guess I am just venting and needing to share into the ether. Maybe it will come to me or via you.

He recently came to stay with me after living with his mom for the majority of the last 7 years we’ve been split. I’ve had him nearly every weekend and for summers up until now. Things were great for about the first month. Then it was nothing but attitude and defiance. He’d try to play it off like he was joking but honestly he was just being disrespectful. I don’t feel like we ask a whole lot from him. His chores are trash, cat box which he signed up for himself, put clean dishes away, tidy his room, and to keep up with his personal hygiene. We occasionally ask with help keeping an eye on his 20 month old sister while we get dinner finished up or something. Getting him to do anything is like pulling teeth. He has no problems telling us no and standing there until we have to physically get things going. He refuses haircuts, to brush it, or even attempt to do anything with it. He constantly picks on my step son who is 6 months younger than him. He pushes everyone’s buttons like it’s his calling. He seems to get a kick out of frustrating or annoying people. And recently he’s started picking on our pets too. Chasing the cat constantly, grabbing him and forcing him on the couch and holding him there. Opening our dogs crate to encourage her out then slams the door in her face. We tried online school as he’s had issues with getting along at school with students and teachers so we thought we’d give it a try and it was going well until I realized he was sneaking it in the middle of the night to watch skibidi toilet and the like which he knows isn’t allowed in either household. The boy has the guts to sneak in my room while we’re sleeping to get the laptop. The third offense of that paired with the constant disrespect and general lack of caring for anything we took everything out of his room. That was five weeks ago and things are just getting worse. With the last two days putting my wife and I to our breaking point. It took every ounce of restraint not to smack him across his mouth when he yelled at me “I don’t care it’s not like I’m going to do anything you say.” Which is huge to me as being a victim of child abuse it really tears me up to reach that point with my kids. I want to get him into therapy but we recently moved states and can’t find anyone that will accept our insurance and I’m currently unemployed due to an injury awaiting disability, so I’m coming up short there. I feel like I’m failing him and I have no idea how to move forward without things getting worse. We’ve tried making him clean, sitting at the table all day, sitting in his room all day, writing positive sentences, making him do exercises, and he will tell us no, stare at us, yell at us, argue with us over everything until he tries to turn it into a shouting match, and fight us tooth and nail to do anything and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’m desperate at this point because it’s really affecting our other kids in a negative way. ",2024-11-12 02:17:11

My ultimate fear here is this- if she does believe and is just asking for all of these very expensive electronics because in her words ""they don't cost Santa money"", come Christmas morning she could possible realize that it's all fake and that would, in my opinion be the worst time to learn the truth, on the other hand if she is just trying to ""play the game"" by asking for expensive items to make us buy her these things, then I would find it more reasonable to speak with her ASAP and let her be a part of the ""Santa team"" for her 2y/o brothers Christmas

In spring of 2023 something changed with my mother, we couldn’t put our finger on it but we knew something was different. Well after she failed to bring our grandmother, my child’s great grandparent to one of our daughters dance recitals everything unraveled. We found out my mother aka “grandma” from here on out had gotten into a relationship with a drug addict with a very long criminal history. There was a lot of family drama regarding the whole situation because the family of the drug addict made a huge scene at a restaurant while my family and my wife was having dinner, I was not there. After this big scene happened we sat down with grandma and asked for the truth about what was going on, this was about fall 2023. We were told she thought she could fix him because she was a healthcare worker before retiring for health reasons, she had tried cocaine with him and he stole from her and it was just a big mess. At the time we said well as long as you’re not continuing to do cocaine I guess give us some time and we can work on getting our daughter to hang out with you again. 
Now important to note our daughter loves grandma to death and back, she is obsessed and she asks about her constantly. We had to hold her back awhile because our trust was broken and we became the bad guys because how do you tell a 5 year old grandma is on drugs? Eventually we allowed our daughter to interact with grandma and things were semi normal through early 2024 but never the same they were before she found this loser. We left out of state from beginning of summer to fall 2024 for work and when we returned we had dinner with other close family members. Well some of them still don’t talk to grandma because of those past issues so the whole thing got brought up again, and that is when my wife and I found out we were lied to quite a bit and given a very watered down version of the truth. Now we are very upset we stay avoiding grandma and not letting our kids around her again, this all comes to a head one night when grandma asks why we hate her. We stated our case and said we all should sit down and talk and get to the actual truth. Well due to several issues we couldn’t get the other family members together and we are heading out of town again for work very soon and wanted to settle this asap. So we met with grandma again and explained all our problems about the lies and why the truth wasn’t given to us etc. during this visit we decided to get a 12 panel drug screen that we asked her to take before we ever let her near the kids again.
Well the test we bought off Amazon, sealed with great reviews was a 12 panel and lo and behold it tests positive for coc300 aka cocaine. 
Now we’re super nervous and wanted like hell to give her the benefit of the doubt so my wife goes to cvs to grab another 12 panel test different company and grandma who lives a few streets away ran home to her dying dog, yes it actually is close to dying, and both came back. My wife watched her pee twice, second test comes back negative but not with a consistent line and both urine samples insanely dilute like near water color. So now we have an issue because we have two tests with different results, she denies denies denies everything. So she has some little strip test in her purse because she thought we may want to know which is odd, well I decided to run that strip test on the positive urine because maybe that test was really bad, nope the strip test was also positive. Now we have one test negative after additional water and maybe something else she went to get we have no idea and two separate tests positive from first urine.

My wife and I told her we will just leave it be for now because we didn’t want to get into a huge argument there and we are leaving in a week and will be gone for months so we’re lucky to be removed from her by work. But both of us think she is still using cocaine and we don’t know what the hell to do. She’s denying it and doesn’t want help obviously, we’re heartbroken and hurt and our daughter now almost 7 thinks we’re garbage because we refuse and will continue to refuse to let her see grandma. In fact grandma will be up in north Georgia with other family for Christmas and we are in another state close by but we don’t even want to be a part of Christmas because of this.
How do we get her help, how do we tell our daughter without saying grandma is a drug addict and what else can we do? Any and all help is appreciated we feel very lost here navigating territory we never thought we would ever have to. We don’t know what to do except keep our kids away because protecting them is priority number 1 always.

I ended up spending a weekend yelling at them, and making them feel horrible about the state of the house. I was wrong. Please don't pile on. I feel horrible. I contacted my doc and immediately put myself back on my anxiety medicine, apologized, explained it was my problem and I should've have taken it out on them.

My husband took a new position last year and it has required multiple business trips already. He has done some work travel but it feels like more each year he is in his career. I knew it would require some travel-as he “moves up” at his firm the travel seems to be increasing. I told him I wasn’t sure about the travel before he accepted. He could stay at his type of job before and still make enough salary for our lifestyle/college for the kids etc. So far this calendar year it’s been about 6 trips I think- averaging 5 days each time. He will have 2 more coming up-so in 1 year about 8/9 trips.

I’m a SAHM and homeschool; we have 2 kids. I don’t mind when he is gone in terms of the day to day. I make one night pizza night and stuff like that. Kids have nice days and I do some extra fun activities to help them be occupied. 

I guess my question is-does this impact my kids’ well-being long-term? I worry that with him working so much it could impact them emotionally? On the other hand, the reason I can stay home and homeschool is because he works these type of higher level positions. Just curious any thoughts or advice on the situation.

She is diagnosed with anxiety and is on medication for it currently. Her dad is jacked up in the head and it has caused some serious anger issues for her that she directs toward us (mom, step dad, especially sisters), and the therapist said that it's going to be like this for awhile. All of that is fine and dandy, she has needs, I love her, and we're working through it. 

My problem is complete defiance, which stems from the anger. She will NOT clean her room, like at all. I've broken it into smaller tasks, gave her incentives, taken away privileges, I mean I'm talking weeks of it, and this is a repeat problem. One day she finally cleans and then the next day it is trashed to holy hell. I even do all of her laundry and fold it and sit it in her room, and she throws it all on the floor and scatters it everywhere, refusing to put it away. If she does put it away, she throws it all in the floor looking for an outfit the next morning and the cycle repeats. She uses the whole ""it's MY room so if you want it clean, you clean it, because I like it this way,"" approach.

She gets home from school before I get home from work (usually 1-2 hours alone at home) and she will NOT do anything I ask. Right now it's just her room- she has no other chores except cleaning the guinea pig cage. A whole other story. She doesn't have her phone, any electronics (unless she watches TV when I'm gone, and I have no way to control that). My other option is to make her take the bus to the sitters with her younger sister, but my issue is basketball. 

Basketball practice is from 6-7:30 four nights a week and then Saturday she has games. After her game she goes to her dad's until Sunday night right before bed. I don't get home until closer to 5 so whether she's at the sitters or home, there's no time for her to do anything she's supposed to do and I feel like she's using that to her advantage. 

Basketball is a team sport and she NEEDS socialization in positive ways, it's exercise, a way for her to gain confidence, etc etc and I don't want to take that from her, but the ""whoops, I'm out of time 🤷🏻‍♀️"" excuse is getting freaking ridiculous, and her not doing it when I'm not home is getting old. Granted, she won't do it even when I am home. I have like nothing else I can do at this point. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this never ending cycle. But again, I'm nervous to pull the whole ""you can't go to practice/games unless your room is clean."" 

This her ONE expectation. She is not expected to do literally anything else besides cleaning that guinea pig cage once a week. So I don't feel like I'm overloading her.

Thank you everyone.

I noticed early on she was a bit different in her interactions, gestures, emotional regulation etc. I got her evaluated for austism and she is not on the spectrum.

She was diagnosed was sensory processing disorder and emotional regulation issues and she does have some fidgeting gestures she does and just things you notice as a parent that aren’t typical. I got her into OT therapy right away and saw a difference. Insurance stopped covering it and I couldn’t afford 250 a session per week anymore. (This was about 1.5 years ago)

She is thriving in school very smart and very well behaved she is also a sweetheart. She would give the shirt of her back to another kid if they needed it. She loves to be social and makes friends quickly, when we’re at the park she’ll go right up to other kids and play.

Where I’m struggling is she is having very intense emotional tantrums and outbursts. They aren’t often but when they happen they are intense. Just today no one wanted to play with her after school. (Her siblings are all tired and I am also exhausted). She threw a huge tantrum and was so beyond frustrated she was screaming at the top of her lungs hitting and banging on things, then she started hitting herself. That’s when I got up made her sit on the couch and told her she needs to calm down and how dangerous it is to hit yourself especially in the head. 

OT therapy is just insanely expensive out of pocket, is there something else I can do for her to help with her emotional regulation? Child therapist? Some type of specialist that can work with her and her emotions?

With the attention-span ruining blackhole that is TikTok and other short-form media, endless social network clout chasing, and general phone/social media addiction in mind, I've got no clue what my rules on phones and internet are going to be.

My gut reaction was to just blanket-ban it all. No unsupervised internet access (computer in main living area only) and no smart phone that is capable of social media. Sure, kids are going to go over to friends houses and do stuff, but the goal is to limit the extreme hold it might have on their life.

But I'm also not dumb, if my kid is the only one without a Snapchat Instagram TikTok whatever, they're going to be ostracized. Even if they're not, my kids are going to hate me for not letting them have something literally every other kid has, especially something that seems so *fun.* Additionally, it's not like social media is going anywhere anytime soon, nor are smartphones. Maybe it's best to help them safely navigate those waters without feeding into a tech addiction?

We've tried the pants-less thing twice now and both times it was a disaster. We've been prompting them, taking them there with or without them telling us, sitting them down on the potty, offered treats/prizes, everything we can think of. I had hoped that them being in preschool would encourage them but they're so damn smart and willful. Sometimes they will take themselves to the potty or ask to go when we're out, but only ever to pee. My one twin will occasionally, if we catch him in time, poop in the potty, but my other one will not. Not at all. We once sat on the toilet for 30 minutes waiting for it to happen. He would not, and as soon as his pull-up was back on, he ran into a corner and pooped in it.

They're not scared of the potty, they just refuse to use it. They'd rather go in their pull-ups.

  
I'm out of ideas. At this point I'm going to resign myself to keeping them in pullups until they're 5 and I just want to throw myself out a window. I feel like a failure as a parent. It's so damn hard to teach them anything because they just want to do what they want to do when they want to do it. I don't know how to teach or convince them that they need to do this. I need help.

I have 3 kids. I have a daughter who is 7 and a son who is 6. He can be a bit difficult at times (they all can), one of his habits being ruining things that his sister is working on-- puzzle, art etc. It annoys me. I try to be patient and calm but in a recent situation I think I exploded a bit and in the heat of the moment I felt like he needed more serious consequences to learn not to continue doing this. I just don't think I went about it correctly...

My daughter had just finished drawing a picture that she worked on over the course of 2 days. She was so proud of it and said it was her masterpiece. She left it on the art table and went to go do something else. In the meantime my son came to the art table and even though he knew she had just made this piece, he used her artwork to ""test out some markers"", scribbling over part of her work. I knew she would be upset and even though she wasn't there yet to see what he had done I was quite angry. I grabbed a crayon and went up to his room and scribbled on a piece of art that he was extremely proud of. I ruined it. I turned around and as soon as I saw his face, tears streaming down, I felt like I had made a horrible mistake. I obviously don't want to teach my kids an eye for an eye but I DID want to teach him how it feels to have something that you were proud of ruined. He yelled ""I was wrong, you're not a kind mommy!"" and seemed off with me for days. My husband even looked at me like I was crazy. Yes it was a mistake, but was it HORRIBLE? Am I crazy? It has now been almost a month and I'm just starting to feel a bit less guilt. It has really been bothering me.

I did apologize and used this as an opportunity to explain that parents make mistakes.

I guess I'm looking for support, or maybe just honesty. Am I a terrible mom? I don't normally react this way. But I do sometimes feel like I go to easy on my kids and then randomly decide to be strict and sometimes it just comes out wrong. I need to have a better way of determining appropriate consequences I suppose.",2024-11-11 19:58:51

I gave birth to our second baby 4 months ago. I’m exclusively breastfeeding and we have a son who’s 2. 

Our daughter doesn’t sleep well at night. Most nights, she wakes at 1am and doesn’t sleep well till 5am. At 5am she’s wide awake and ready to start the day. 

I had a rough pregnancy so didn’t sleep well since 5 months of being pregnant. Because I’m the only one who’s been awake at night for the last months, I find it normal that my partner wakes at 5am to take care of our daughter so I can catch an hour or two of sleep before I start my day. 

He loves the evening and likes to play videogames, which is fine by me. But he doesn’t go to bed before 12 / 1 am. That makes that he doesn’t have many hours to sleep. He’s tired in the morning and finds that I should let him sleep in from time to time. 

So: is it valid that he wants to sleep in too and am I too egocentric in this or should he choose to sleep in earlier and get the rest he needs earlier in the night?

I co parent with his dad who has him about half the time. My main concern is feeling so tapped out most days that I rely a lot on screens. Also, I get this real knife to the heart feeling whenever my son expresses preference towards his Dad. I never show this, but I feel it. I go between knowing that I'm trying my best despite my limitations and socioeconomic status and feeling like a total piece of shit mom.
I work almost full time and I have a partner (42f) who lives with us with her daughter (17f), but we work separate shifts so I spend most school nights alone with my son. His dad has him more on the weekends bc he goes to school in the district where I live. And honestly I feel like he doesn't sleep that great at his dad's bc his dad ""has always slept better with the tv on"" and thinks this is somehow genetic. So, dad falls asleep and son stays up late watching tv. 
I do make sure to take him 1 or 2 weekends a month, or split the weekend, so I can try and plan a little something fun to do and can rely on my partner to help.
During the week I'm able to shut the tv off for bed time and he sleeps through the night. I'm so embarrassed to admit that we still use pull ups for night time bc he still does not get up go and get himself back to bed. And I just really need my sleep to function and I take meds that just knock me pretty well out. I wish I had it in me to get him up when I get up to pee, but I just don't.
He goes to school every day and is a good student. He goes to after school 3 days a week until I'm out of work. There he does get to run around and play with other kids. He likes it. My dad also brings him to karate 1 night a week at a place that is a distance away so it takes up a lot of time. All this is to say that this is screen free time. Otherwise, when he's here he's usually watching random gamer/goofy stuff on YouTube. Or playing vr or playing iPad. I am usually in the same room or close enough to supervise. I'll just be in my phone relaxing or getting random stuff done while he entertains himself with screens. We do interact quite a bit over whatever he's watching and if it's inappropriate I make him changes it and try and block that account. But I just feel so bad bc we don't have a daily thing that we do that's screen free. Like I barely read him books. We do crafts sometimes. By the time I work, and do chores and do the pt I have to do almost daily to function, and get him food and get him bathed... I just am done after that. He probably gets 1-5 hours of screen time depending on the day. I feel like I'm always comparing myself to whoever, just the world in general, in a way that makes me come up short.
I have ehlers danlos syndrome and endometriosis and hashimotos. So I go through a lot of pain and fatigue and treatments and meds. I just think he deserves better. I don't really have too much sorry other than what I described. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for with this... Just to vent and get some advice or commiseration.

I am also concerned about his character and worldview if he is isolated. What does everyone else do? How much should I push him to volunteer? 

What activities do your preteen kids volunteer in? Logically the best use of his time is to tutor kids who need help, but it's difficult to get permission to do so. Things like soup kitchens and organizing donations for refugees may be more available, but he's pretty clumsy so he would be less helpful.

About 18 children coming, some from their class and some from an extracurricular activity. Some of their friends have siblings and when their moms RSVP'd, they asked about the siblings which I said absolutely! More the merrier 🎉

My problem is, there's 2 friends from their sports team who RSVP'd, but I know they have siblings because they're at all the games and practices. The 1 mom texted ""we""re coming to the party"" with a smiley face and the other said "" X is coming to the party!""

I'm making extra bags, of course, but all the treats come in packs of 24... so I have 24 bags planned since 18 RSVP'D (18 is including the siblings that were RSVP'D for). 

One friend has 3 siblings, but ones a baby, so I'm counting in the other 2 just in case and that puts us at 20 bags. The other family comes with anywhere from 4-7 children. I believe a few are cousins, but many times the mom comes with all 7 kids to watch the game/practice. The kiddos are usually running around (kinda wild like kiddos do) while the mom watches the game. 

My husband and I have a big feeling the friend and mom are going to come and bring some of these children. I don't know for sure and I don't really know her well enough to ask. We don't know which ones are siblings vs cousins because they come in different combinations of 4-7.

If anyone has taken their child to a friend's birthday party and brought a sibling(s) and didn't mention it when they RSVP'd, did you expect party favors for them? It feels silly (and kinda wasteful) to buy more sets of 24ct treats just for 3 more bags when I don't even know if they're all coming.

As parents do you expect bags for  the siblings that tag along if you don't RSVP letting the parents know you're bringing them?

Please help. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gozntc/the_decision_about_having_another_child_has/,1,"I am in a pretty tough place (I made a new account for this as it’s pretty personal and my family knows my main account). I’m hoping to get some perspective from anyone else who’s been here. 

My daughter (the light of my life, perfect in every way) is two years and two months. If I had another child I would really want the age gap to not be too large, so the longer this drags on the more I spiral. 

I have no idea what to do. This is such an important decision, and it’s literally all I think about. I’m terrified of making the wrong choice. I can’t sleep, my hair is falling out, and I’m crying every night. I’ve never experienced this before or felt so much stress around one decision (things like marrying my husband or having my daughter were never a hard choice for me - they both just felt 100% right). 

On one hand, having another child makes a ton of sense. All I want is for my daughter to be happy, and I know she would make such a great big sister. My parents and sisters would be thrilled (it’s unlikely any other kids will be born in our family). My sisters are my best friends and I know how powerful sibling relationships can be. 

Financially, we could afford it just fine. We’d probably sacrifice being in a town we “love” for one we “like” to get more space, but we could absolutely live comfortably with two in a nice house in a safe town with good schools. We could afford newborn-phase help. We have a great village of family and friends around us as well. 

Health-wise, there are no real concerns. I’m 32 and very healthy. Pregnancy was easy, and I have great insurance and access to great care. My job is wonderfully flexible and I would have another six month fully paid mat leave. 

So, I feel like most of the reasons people give for being one and done don’t necessarily apply. My problem is that for me, personally/selfishly/considering only myself, I don’t want another. I get way more excited thinking about a life with our family of three, giving my daughter everything she needs and traveling the world together, vs. managing a house with multiple kids, carting them around to different weekend activities, getting pulled in two directions all the time. We are SO happy right now, and I worry about rocking the boat. 

But, are these reasons superficial? Am I going to look back in 30, 40, 50 years and think “wow I let a *desire to go on vacations* stop me from such a rewarding thing as another child”? Everyone says “just have one more - you won’t regret it!” Seeing them play and develop a relationship would definitely be rewarding. Things like holidays would be more fun with a larger family. 

I don’t know. I’ve read everything I can think of to read. I’ve read every single reddit thread about this (there are hundreds). I’ve done the exercise of considering your life years from now. I’ve made a long pros and cons list. No matter what I do, both decisions feel wrong. Not deciding is somehow even worse - I’m surrounded by clothes and toys she’s grown out of and they’re a constant reminder of this. I want - need - to just make a choice and move on. 

My husband is absolutely wonderful - he is also on the fence. I think if either of us felt very strongly one way that would help - but we both see the benefits and downsides of both. 

My question is not really whether one or two is better - I know it’s subjective, and the topic has been beat to death already. I’m really just looking to hear from people who have been here - how did you decide? And how did you make peace with your decision and move forward, even knowing all the what-ifs?

She was a colicky newborn that turned into an extremely clingy baby that turned into a pre toddler that screamed all day. Now she’s 2.5 and the “terrible twos” are ripping my soul to shreds. I came into two as positively as possible and am always telling myself this is one of the biggest years for cognitive development and its souls has been. She’s very smart, picks things up fast and communicates with most people pretty clearly. 

That said she’s an absolute nightmare. She whines all day and begs for things that she can’t have (think chocolate chips for breakfast and nothing else). When she asks for something and I clearly say yes let’s go get X she will panic and tell me she wants X over and over until it’s in her hands. I can’t even start with the bedtime dramatics either. She won’t sleep when I lay with her but then she will just cry and beg for her mommy to be her until she eventually passes out from exhaustion. Bedtime is always at 8 the routine starts at 730 I leave her room at 810 after snuggling her. Her day starts at 7 and if I’m not giving her my undivided attention she will be underfoot to the point that I’ve tripped over her.

I have a four month old and she seems to have accepted him as her brother. She can be a bit rough with him but that’s probably just the age… and he’s such an easy baby that he basically gets forgotten until he starts squawking about because my daughter is so demanding.

I’m a SAHM, but I’m considering going back to work because I can’t handle her anymore. This isn’t PPD or PPA I felt that really deep with my first but honestly I’ve felt more like myself after having my son than I have in a while. 

Anyways, my whole point is: can someone give me hope? I’m losing the will to mother.


TL;DR: can anyone that had a difficult child share how they turned out. When things started getting better. I need a light at the end of the tunnel",2024-11-11 14:37:36
parenting,1goz4x2,Toddler detached from mom,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1goz4x2/toddler_detached_from_mom/,2,"I’m a work-from-home dad with a 16-month-old toddler. My day starts at 6 a.m., caring for him until 4 p.m., while also working a 9-to-5 schedule. My wife works in an office, and we’ve managed to make things work smoothly by sticking to a strict routine. Our toddler is independent, happy, and usually not too demanding.

The challenge is when my wife gets home. She wants to spend time with him, but he’s all about me. If I’m not around, he sometimes gets so upset that he cries and even throws up. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, it’s really tough on her emotionally.

I try stepping away when she’s home so they can have one-on-one time, but it doesn’t always work. He either clings to me or comes looking for me, which just makes her feel worse.

One thing my wife has noticed is that he might feel a little disconnected from her because, when she gets home, we agreed she’d handle things like changing him, bathing him, and brushing his teeth—since I do those tasks during the day. The issue is, I always try to make those things fun, but she’s a bit more focused on just getting them done. He usually ends up crying during those moments, which probably doesn’t help.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How do you help rebuild that bond between your child and your partner? Would love to hear your thoughts.",2024-11-11 18:23:21

parenting,1goz248,Boundaries not respected for over two years,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1goz248/boundaries_not_respected_for_over_two_years/,4,"I finally snapped at my mother yesterday. 
For two years she didn’t respect my rules and how I wanted to parent. I let a lot of stuff go since she helps me a lot with watching her and letting her spend the night. But I finally had enough.

When my LO was a baby I tried to sleep train. She immediately made me feel bad for “letting my baby cry” she cried 5 minutes max. And it was more a whine and a fuss. I never let her fully cry. Wed finally get her on a good sleep schedule and sleeping through the night. And then my mom would say no I’m not doing that at my house I’m holding her to sleep. I let it go bc fine she’s not comfortable with it. But to let her watch tv past her bed time and then in the middle of the night? 

When I switched her off bottle and into sippy cups I told my mom it’s time to switch. And I come over one day to find she’s still using bottles because “she’s a baby”. 

She admitted to me she doesn’t check cookies etc for nuts when my daughter is allergic. She says I’ve given it to her before and she’s fine. I told her the reason it states it’s in the facility is because not all pieces will have nuts but there’s a possibility there is. Why risk it just because it’s not directly placed in the product. 

I said she can have candy. But one. Nobody needs more than one piece. Nobody needs ice cream for lunch. Since I said no. It’s the opposite. Lollipops at 10 PM. Ice cream for lunch. Staying up til midnight and watching cartoons at 4 am. 

I had enough yesterday. I face timed my mom and the 180 my daughter did was astonishing. 
My happy, respectful, cute girl suddenly became very mean, whiny, throwing things, pulling my hair, making mean eyes at me and screaming. If I told her no she’d cry and my mom would tell me that she’s a baby and expressing herself. And would make me out to be bad. I hung up on her. The rest of the night was hell. My daughter cried her entire bath. Cried and screamed for everything. She told me she was tired and went to bed a hour early. She only had 4 hours of sleep the night before at my moms. My mom asked me if I was still mad at my daughter. I told her I am not mad at my daughter I was mad with her. I told her it’s not cute or funny to let her do everything she wants and encourage bad behavior. that she needs rules. She will not hate my mother or treat her different. That she needs to stop countering me in front of my daughter bc she’ll learn it’s okay to counter me. She sends me a text later that night that one day I will understand when I am a grandmother and that grandmas give their grandkids everything. And 
If she’s a bad influence she’ll just visit rather than keep her at her house. I know she’s saying this to say she just won’t help watch her anymore and to victimize herself again. If she brings this up again I will point out my in laws respect my one candy rule, respect her nap schedule, and are very careful to read for nut allergies. My father also respects rules and knows they are good to shape her into a respectable person in society. 

I simply told her I never once said she’s a bad influence and that I am saying to apply rules to her. Everybody has rules. My daughter is no different. It’s been silence since then.

I am done being quiet about it just because of the help. Seeing my daughters personality completely change yesterday was such an eye opener to how bad it is. 

I hate causing issues and having confrontation but I can’t stand it anymore.

Sorry for the long post. Just needed to vent. ",2024-11-11 18:20:21

Wife and I have a 4.5 year old and a 2 year old. They play pretty well together, rarely fighting or not sharing. The problem we are running into is the constant redirection and intervention of activity. On the weekends it's just nonstop and I've felt like we've spent the entire day just telling them no or to do something different and it's exhausting.

Today is a perfect example. Basically from the time we got up at 6A.M. to the time we go to sleep at 8 it's:  no don't do that, this is the proper way to do this, don't jump on that, show me gentle hands, get that out of your mouth, say sorry/please. All the while they're asking to do this, eat that, watch something on the t.v, etc.

And all that to go with the fact that I took them on 3 different bike rides with two trips to the park.

At some point they've got to be able to just play or behave the right way, right?

I just feel like I spend the entire day redirecting and I'm getting overwhelmed.

I'm coming here to vent a smidge, but really b/c I need some advice on how to handle this without killing her (figuratively speaking). Her tuition for the semester is $24k and she just pissed it away and doesn't seem to truly grasp the gravity of all of this. It also seems like she has been lying. She says she went to her classes, but based on her phone usage stats which we have access to b/c she's on our plan, last Wednesday, for example, she was on her phone for 16 PLUS HOURS. She's averaging 13 hours a day - and that's just on her phone... She has started tipping people on TikTok (I didn't even know that is a thing) and she's talking about some gamer on Twitch that she's following?

parenting,1goyh01,Second child dilemma is making my head and heart explode,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1goyh01/second_child_dilemma_is_making_my_head_and_heart/,1,"Me and my husband are currently trying to decide whether to have a second child or not, and it's consuming my every waking moment so I've come here desperately seeking advice. The context (sorry it's long):

Before we had any kids, I always wanted 2 (because I am the elder of 2) and my husband always wanted 1 (because he doesn't get on with his older sister who is not a nice person). We had our daughter who is now 2.5 and it inverted - I now want 1 and he wants 2.

BUT due to my age (F39) I now feel like I can't completely rule it out because the choice will be taken away from me soon enough and I can see myself regretting only having one child further down the line.

My husband (M42) wants another to be a friend to our daughter. He says he sees her following other kids around and it breaks his heart. He also looks back over old photos and gets upset seeing her as a squidgy newborn because he wants that again.

My reasons meanwhile for not wanting another are: I had a traumatic birth and recovery, and suffered mild post-natal depression. I did not enjoy the year of maternity leave and only felt like myself again once I went back to work. We only have my parents for babysitting, and they've already said they couldn't help much with another child as they are getting on themselves in age (mid 70s), so we'd lose what little time we currently have to ourselves. Financially we are about to move house and increase our outgoings a LOT so adding another child with full-time nursery fees (my parents currently look after our daughter 2 days a week so we only pay for 3 days of nursery for her) really concerns me. I want to give our daughter experiences and adventures with lots of travel etc. which we couldn't afford with 2. Having a child at 40+ comes with increased risks and the lack of sleep, stress etc. is just generally more difficult. Most of all, our marriage has really suffered from having one child - we've lost ourselves behind the fog of parenting, to the point where we're now arranging marriage counselling (starting probably end of the year) - so I'm worried what impact having another child would have. This decision however is a contributing factor to our problems.

That's what my head says. My heart however kicks in saying I couldn't imagine life without my sister, two kids can entertain each other, they'd have someone to share their universe as only siblings can, they wouldn't be alone when my husband and I are old/gone. In the grand scheme of life the newborn/toddler years are just a blip. I know one day our daughter will ask for a brother or sister. I know my husband would resent me for saying no even though he says he would try to heal from it. And I know in 10 years' time I'll hate myself when the choice is gone.

I can only describe our daughter as an angel, she's so lovely. Half of me says quit while we're ahead and the other half wonders about the potential other person we could create as we're obviously doing something right with this one. I am going in circles and it's driving me INSANE. My husband is now saying that he's been in limbo for 2 years and can't take it anymore so he wants to decide now. I'm not ready to decide but I know biology is coming for me.

Thank you for reading if you've made it this far :) Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you decide? How did it work out?",2024-11-11 17:57:23

I love him so much and I want to enjoy him more and I want him to experience a mom who takes real pleasure in being with him.  There are nice and sweet times for sure but overall my lows are too frequent and there are times that I feel pure helplessness and rage. I don’t know what to do with myself and I’m not sure what my question is. I think I want some heartfelt advice. ❤️ ",2024-11-11 15:13:39

First, I want to thank each and every one of you that helped in some way, I sincerely appreciate all of you.

Second, I apologize this update is late. Life has been quite busy. 

Since the original post, I got my boy in for all the help I mentioned I would. We currently have a short term counselor that is the raddest dude I've ever met, and he connects with my son very well. My boy actually opens up to him, which is huge. We will be very sad when his services run up (he's only a 30 day program). We have a more long term counselor lined up, so we will see how that goes. I took him in for a psych evaluation and a med review a few weeks ago. The psychiatrist feels no additional psych services (except for a counselor) and a med change is not necessary, since the only variable is dad and his house. Since he is fine at my house and his academics are amazing, they feel he is not in immediate crisis, which is good. I'm proud to have a home he feels safe and comfortable in. 

I've had both my 13 year old and his 11 year old in my care ever since. I explained as nicely as I could to his father about what's going on with him and that the best thing for the kids right now is to stay with me. By sheer luck, he agreed with me and hasn't fought me on it at all. The psychiatrist that did my boys review was so appaled by dad's home she made a CPS report right then and there. The following day they went to his house, when I assume they basically kicked his ass, because he's finally doing something about his house. That weekend he had a giant rolloff dumpster and started gutting his house, so we shall see. I don't know when they will go back to his house, they are still refusing to even go. I know eventually they will, and I am very nervous for when that day comes. For now, I'm just going to keep focusing on my kids and everything they need.

As of right now, my boy is stable, healthy, and happy, and it's been amazing having them here full time.

Thank you all again, I can't begin to describe how much it means to me ❤️",2024-11-10 13:21:22

If I ask her to immerse them or expose French to my children how beneficial would this be? She’s on the pricier side but I like the idea of combining childcare with a second language so maybe worth it. If I do see them picking up the language I would make an effort for them to maintain the language with her once they’re in school. My dad also speaks French so that’s another opportunity for it.

He's been doing better the last few weeks, but daycare just informed us that two other families are blaming our son for their child's behaviors -- primarily hitting. Our daycare lady thinks our son has now become a ""scapegoat"" for other children's bad behaviors. And this may be. But I still want to do what I can for him at home.

We had a smooth start to parenting our only daughter and now face our first real difficulty as it would have a huge impact on our lives. Our daughter (2 + 2 months) has started clearly stating that she does not like her Kindergarden, which she has been attending since she was 10 months. She does so (calmly) every morning for about three weeks now just saying ""Kindergarten not"" and then pleading ""please not Kindergarden"". We have asked her why and the reason but she is not able to articulate it yet. All we get is that she doesn't want to go.

We had a discussion with the staff at Kindergarten now last week but they can't figure it out either. Only note they had is that she now likes to play with the older kids more and she chooses to join the 3-4 year olds over the younger peers in play.

Now we don't want to force her to go if she doesn't want to but that would mean one of us has to take care of her which would be very difficult to put in place. As with everything with kids it might be a phase but what is putting us off is the calm and firm stance of her. Any experience and suggestions are welcome!",2024-11-11 07:29:01

Fast forward three years later. He goes to school/ now in second grade. I work at his school and started last year, first grade.

Keeps looking to see if there car is still there before he warms up.

I (41F) have been with my husband (41M) for 8ish years. My stepson had just turned 5 when I started dating his dad. We got on well and had a great relationship. He primarily lives with us as she gets him 1,3, 5 weekend and a month in summer.  And we continued having a good one till his mom,who is still in the picture, heard him call me mom one day. Since then it’s been rocky. It got worse after our son came along. 
Almost 2 years ago stepson (13 at the time) got into a little trouble so we took away his iPad. Going through it we found out he’d been staying up until all times of the night talking to all sorts of random online people and saying lots of inappropriate things and occasionally being an online bully. One of the comments being along the lines of “when I f@ck a 4 year old”. This comment disturbed me so much as his stepbrother was 4 at the time and sleeping in the room across from him. 
His mom who sucks at parenting but is surprisingly a school principal and us sat him down to talk to him but he never apologized or explained why he would say such stuff. In fact we never got anything from him and because his mom, who constantly undermines us, he barely got any kind of discipline. 
So now almost 2 years later I can barely relax around him because I don’t trust him and because he’s never apologized or given an explanation or hell never shown remorse for what he said. It’s now caused me to have a lot of resentment towards him, towards his mom, and a little to my husband. I finally broke and told my husband all my feelings and he’s agreed that the content still also causes him some pauses. So I’ve asked for family therapy for all 3 of us and privately for him. That comment with other things he’s said over the past 2 years just raises flags for me. Should I just forget it and get over it? What should I do. I’m feeling lost but need to protect my peace and ultimately my son. 
Extra info: my husband told his sons mom that were were going to do therapy and told her about how I’ve been bothered for so long about that and she basically turned it around that she finds it more concerning that I’m still bothered by it. And that he is intelligent and just has dark humor. I don’t buy it but now I’m even more conflicted. She’s a selfish person who cares more about herself than her son so even though I know this it still makes me doubt. ",2024-11-10 23:56:46

I get trying to make the best of the time we do get, but how is that done? It is easy saying it but accomplishing it is something unique. Since I don't have a clue from past experiences and I am just going with my gut at the time it's all going down. Trying to get those life lessons when I can. By writing this out just made me realize I must be doing something right since both kids are great; kind, considerate, caring, thoughtful, little bastards they are. (I say that because all of those qualities are expressed to everyone except my wife and I. or at least it feels that way most days.) Don't get me wrong they treat us with respect, no doubt, but it seems like we have to almost force it out of them. But I catch them saying things when we're talking that let me know they are good kids, because I never thought like that at their age. But I guess maybe that is the difference being involved does for them, so no matter what type of dad you are (as long as you aren't a piece of s\*\*t) being involved truly matters. I wish there was a way to affirm that for my sake at least. What do you do with your kids? How do you make sure to get that time in? With this fast-paced society, we all live in these days time seems to move so fast that a year feels like a couple of months, does it not? What type of life lessons are important to you? In what ways do you know that they are sinking in? So Fathers feel free to comment of this as the more the information the better for us to all reflect on.

Just venting but the constant drama for me is too much I help when I can but the one time I say no she gets upset. I kind of just feel used and I’m treated like a babysitter and if I bring it up it’s oh well I pay the majority of the stuff because I work more. Which is true but the reason she works more is because she’s financially irresponsible and I also work 3 days compared to her 5 and am with the kids 5 days compared to her 2. But I still try to give her the half for the daycare when I can even though sometimes I don’t have enough food for a couple days because of it. The worst part is honestly I just have nobody to talk to about my kids because people without kids don’t understand and I just don’t have friends like that. But the ammount of stress and sleep deprivation these kids give  me is high . But whenever I bring it up to her she just kind of brushes it off with the oh you think you the only one who is going through something . I’m just not sure what to do and it just sucks because she has no empathy at this point I’m either one of two roles a babysitter or a bank and it’s draining me . The more I help her the less I can help myself. Ig what I’m trying to say is the sad reality is when you coparenting you are just a tool and that’s it. On the bright side at least I get to see my kids and don’t have any problems that way. I have hope tho that one day it will be better . But being a dad who’s consistently there for the kids is hard man. That’s why many people either neglect their kids or leave altogether. But I care too much and get taken advantage the only thing there is to do now is just have good boundaries and protect my energy when I can because this life is hard and some people use others to get ahead y’all stay blessed.,2024-11-11 19:24:34

I've learned so far that kids are weird and unpredictable and might not care at all about something you elaborately planned, but then go bananas for something simple and random.

As kids grows up and and becomes more capable, they'll quickly become able to do anything an adult can do and it'll be more straightforward to plan fun stuff.  In the Pre-K window it's tricky to think of things to do that is within their limited abilities, fun for them, and hopefully also engaging for the parents.

We’re considering moving out of London to a town where we would have MIL, sister, SIL, auntie, and a few good friends with babies very close (same town or within a 30 min drive). But this would make our commutes 1 hour 30 each way. Husband has to be in the office 3 days a week, and moving companies is non negotiable, and I am in the office about once a week (I could likely quite easily find a remote job in my industry if need be).

We both love living in London but I’m leaning towards moving, as I know how much I would value the “village” - where we are now we have pretty much no village - friends are all spread out across London and are all (currently) child free and nearest family are a 1.5-2 hour drive away. Although I do acknowledge that longer days due to commute would mostly affect my husband and would not be great for family life.

Husband would prefer to stay where we are. I think this is largely because he doesn’t like the “small town” life and doesn’t want to move back close to where he grew up.

This morning, my 2-year-old had what can only be described as an apocalyptic meltdown. The cause of this emotional explosion? His banana broke in half.

We were having a perfectly normal breakfast, and he was happily holding his banana when, suddenly, the unspeakable happened. It snapped clean in half. The look on his face was pure betrayal, like the banana had personally offended him. He threw both pieces on the floor and screamed like his world had just crumbled before his eyes. I tried to put the pieces back together, even pretended it was a “magic banana,” but no luck – he was inconsolable.

I offered a new banana, thinking that might fix it, but he refused, sobbing even harder at the mere sight of it. Eventually, I just sat there holding him while he wailed about this existential banana crisis. It was 20 minutes of total chaos before he calmed down, and by then, I felt like I needed a nap more than he did.

Anyone else’s kid had a meltdown over something totally ridiculous? It’s moments like these that remind me just how serious little things can be to a toddler. Would love to hear your stories – misery loves company, right?",2024-11-10 03:11:36

She’s begging us to let them hang out. That he’s a good person and works hard (he works with his mom two days a week… I’m not sure where or doing what).

My daughter is about 3 and a half. We were super lucky that she pretty much slept through for a solid 12 hours before she turned 3, probably because she didn't nap during the day. 

Now she's up 1 - 3 times in the night. It's particularly bad at the moment as she's going through an only wanting mummy phase, so if I get up for her she just shouts 'I DON'T WANT YOU' and basically won't settle until her mum gets up. We think we do the right thing in just going in and putting her back into bed and leaving. She does settle again quick, but my wife has Crohn's and is tired all the time anyway, and getting up in the night really takes it out of her the following day. 

Her routine is steady. She still likes a bottle which she has around 6, up to brush teeth at 7 and read a couple of books, then we listen to some chilled out classical music which she falls asleep to. We've decided to stop TV at 6 to see if that helps and get some thicker bedding as her room might be a bit cold. Isthere anything else we can try?",2024-11-11 10:20:58
parenting,1god7m2,My daughter(10F) had a big burst out of Roblox ban. How should have handled it better?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1god7m2/my_daughter10f_had_a_big_burst_out_of_roblox_ban/,23,"I'm a single mom of two (10F and 6F), and my 10yo is very strong willed since she was born.

We've buttheaded a lot, and I have several moments that I'm not proud of, but I've been making an effort to make it better, getting therapy, taking medicine, etc..

The most  recent burst out happened yesterday and today, all because of the the damn Roblox.

I hated Roblox from the get go, but I've been allowing her to play as she made a case that ""that's the only way I can connect with my old friends""

We moved shortly after DV events from my ex, and the move, not being able to see her dad and losing communication with his side of the family was really rough on her. So at the time, pros seemed to outweigh the cons.

She's pretty settled down with her new school now and it seemed like she wasn't playing that much with her old friends anymore. She can also connect with them through Discord, or google phone I set up for her. I wasn't liking it that much, but things weren't bad until she started playing Dandy's world...

She got so hooked with this game, she would often bag aggressively for extra time (I control her screen time through MS Family Safety), throw fits if she has to quit in the middle of the game to do something else, and if she were to lose because I didn't give her permission soon enough (or at all), she would cry inconsolably....

I've warned her several times that the way she's hooked into the game is not healthy, and if she can't show that she can be responsible with the game, that game would have to go.

Well, then yesterday happened. 

I normally don't let her play until she's done with her daily homework (some math and reading) and she had promised that she would do it at 11 am. I had made sure to tell her I don't know if it's a good idea, that it might be better off to take care of everything she has to do so her game doesn't get interrupted, and if 11am comes, there will be no ""few minutes more"". She decided to still play first. 

Then 11am came. and she was in the middle of the game, and begged me again for extra time. I put my foot down. She died in the game, and she got so mad she was screaming and throwing stuff, not at someone, but still.. 

I told her that this is an issue, and I can't let her play Roblox anymore (probably not a good timing to say this) and she was continuing to be very aggressive. 

I asked her to go to her room until she calms down. She refused and kept being obnoxious (taking stuff away from her sister, etc..) until I told her that I might have to cancel the plan for the rest of the day. (We were gonna go to an arcade that she's been asking for a long time).

She somehow calmed down a bit, and we had a conversation  about that later on, and things seem to be okay then... Until this morning..

She began to pester me about wanting to play Roblox, and when she realized that I wasn't giving in, she threw even bigger fit than she did yesterday. There was no reasoning with her, there was no ""connecting"" with her, and again.. she refused to go to her room. 

(Just to be clear, going to her room isn't meant to be punishment.  She and I have history of escalating things too much, and I had asked her to go to her room when I ask her to, so we have time to collect ourselves and de-escalate ). 

At this point, I was at a loss for what I can do, short of physically restraining her. I couldn't let her continue to throw and break stuff, and she was refusing to go upstairs. Engaging wasn't working, and ignoring her would make her do more egregious stuff to get my attention. 

This battle lasted over an hour, and she's  still in ""I'm not gonna do what you want me to do until you let me play Roblox"" mode.

I'm really regretting not being strict with her screen time, especially Roblox from the very beginning. 

But now that we are past that.. How should I have handled this situation, and how should I handle the situation if it happens again? 

\*\* We've tried in-network therapy that failed pretty badly (she refused to talk at all for multiple sessions in a row), and her out-of-network therapy is starting tomorrow. I'm hopeful this is more successful, but I need some practical advice to deal with this burst until we find something that works..

My baby is generally a happy baby and I keep telling myself that but cries anytime it’s time to nap or go to bed. Mentally I’m unwell I cry everyday, I’m not finding the positive side to being a mother.

I’ve encouraged her to read my 4yo’s story books to her.

We tried *everything* to get him in the crib.  Nothing worked.  We contact slept around the clock until he was 4 months, then did CIO just to get him off our chests at all.  He was still up many times a night until he was done teething.  Now he sleeps through the night about 4-5 nights a week and is only up 1-2 times the other nights.

My youngest at least was willing to use the crib, but he's been up many times a night since he was born.  For a few months when he was 1, he had split nights *every night*.  Finally broke that habit by the time he was 2.  Then I slept on the floor next to him for a few months after that.  But now he's still up 2-12 times a night.

I've always tried to give as little comfort as possible and nudge them toward independent sleep, but it never seems to pay off with either child until we do something drastic like CIO.  Now that they share a room, I don't like to let either of them fuss at all because they might wake each other up and then you have a night like tonight where the entire household is awake for hours.  My MIL paid for a sleep consultant once who just told us the same basic information I learned in the first week of having a terrible sleeper and, when her plan didn't work, asked for a lot more money.  The pediatrician just says they're the worst sleepers she's had and shrugs.

I can count on 1 hand the number of times that I've slept through the night in the last 2.5 years, and it's not much more than that in the last 4 years.  The only family we have lives out of town and won't babysit because they can't handle these nights.  My husband is at wits' end.  He's ready to just lock the door at bedtime and not open it until morning.  I'm due again in June and I have no idea how we'll survive as a family if something doesn't improve before the new baby is here (who will probably be a terrible sleeper, too).",2024-11-11 09:18:59

I know this sounds crazy, but it is so strong. We have had quite the go trying this time around, with my husband balking a few times and wasting valuable months, and anovulatory cycle, a miscarriage, my husband starting to have trouble performing at crucial times, and now my husband has given me one more cycle to try and then he’s “done.” 

Not to sound dramatic but I am DEVASTATED. I feel depressed, hopeless, that this child who is waiting for us, and I am waiting for, will not happen. But my brain can’t grasp it not happening because to me, he/she already exists. My brain is interpreting this as a true loss, as though that’s true. Yes I have a therapist and a psychiatrist to help me with this but I’m just looking for advice, wisdom for how to get through this? I doubt we will conceive next cycle because it’s been at least 8 months now and if he doesn’t want to have another baby I know he will not be able to perform sexually at the right times (which is what happened this month but also I didn’t ovulate after my MC last month). 

We have never had problems conceiving, thankfully. But I sense that since he’s “done,” my soul baby is also done.

He is now 21 unemployed, living with his grandmother, never graduated high school. My wife and I support him and his grandmother, but it’s getting harder to do with rent and food prices. At this time all he does is reside in his video game world. I want to establish a relationship while getting him motivated to get a job or go to school. I talk to my wife about this, but she seems unwilling to upset him. He’s a good kid, just no motivation and still very poor hygiene. I’m just at my wits end about what to do, he’s to soft and overweight for the military. My wife is against enrolling him in jobcorp. I’m just putting my own faults out there along with the situation and how to handle it better with the desire to build a relationship and have him start contributing to his household",2024-11-11 07:18:08
parenting,1goab1e,Activities for non athletic kid?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1goab1e/activities_for_non_athletic_kid/,47,"My 7 year old son has tried multiple team sports and they’ve all been pretty clear that he’s not a chase the ball team sport type of kid. We’ve done soccer, ice hockey, basketball, t ball, and flag football. And not once have we re enrolled. He does mostly ok during drills and practices, but games are a disaster. He will give zero effort, not pay attention, not listen to the coach, just essentially a clear lack of interest. The confusing thing is, he always wants to sign up but then complains about having to run and give any physical effort. And after the game will say he had fun and paid attention.

I don’t really want to keep trying any team sports because I’m worried we are getting closer to the ages where kids will tease and bully him for not being athletic, also, it doesn’t seem like he’s really enjoying it despite saying that he does. I think he enjoys the aspect of being with other kids and the idea of winning, but doesn’t have any drive to actually try. I do however think it’s important to have activities outside of going to school and would like to find him a more suited match. He has done sailing camps and seems to like them, but sailing doesn’t really pick up until middle school age. I’ve considered golf, swim, and tennis, as these are individual type activities but it’s not easy to find a “team” for these like it is for soccer. 

Any advice on what worked for your non athletic kid? Should I give up on sports all together? In no way do I think he has to be an athlete, but I also won’t allow him to just come home and watch TV or sit on a screen. He is incredibly gifted academically and we do a lot of extra educational type work at home which comes easily for him. He will also play with neighbors and ride his bike for hours at a time, but now that it’s dark at 5:30 and only getting shorter that’s not really an option this time of year. To me, sports teaches you discipline, work ethic, friendship, teamwork… I’m just trying to raise a well rounded kid but struggling with this one aspect! Any advice would be appreciated.

His parents live 4 states away from her. They’ve never been involved grandparents. They FaceTime weekly and send 20 dollars. A few years ago they came to visit and only saw my 5 and 9 year old grandsons twice in 3 months. They did not want to see them anymore than that. 
My daughters spouse died before they went to court due to his alcoholism. He told his family numerous lies including that my daughter made 150,000 or more at a Fortune 500 company, that she abused him, that she wouldn’t let him see the kids, that she spent a lot of money. All lies. She makes an average income and has been the sole provider for her boys for 1.5 years. 
Her husband’s cousin posted on the gofundme negative things like she doesn’t need the money. 
She has 0 dollars at end of the month and I’ve had to provide assistance to her financially. 
Her husband died last week and his mom demanded her engagement ring. The ring was designed by her husband and had a small diamond from her mother’s retirement ring. After she said she wouldn’t give it back my other daughter was contacted by cousin K who asked her to give it back. My daughter wants to keep it for her sons. To share how much they loved each other. 
On top of that cousin W has been ranting to me about how much money my daughter has and how terrible she was to her husband. Her husband was full of financially infidelity, cheated on her and emotionally and verbally abused her for years. He had 45,000 dollars in credit card debt that she didn’t know about. 
Now the grandparent suddenly wants to see the boys when they haven’t even called to see how they are doing or checked on my daughter. Their son died a week ago. My husband and I have been at my daughters every day that we can since this happened.
I forgot to add his dad is a millionaire. They find a go fund me embarrassing but have never helped my daughter.

My husband and I (both 36) have 2 children, 11f and 8m. Before our daughter, we struggled for years with no luck at all and then 2 pregnancies (1 single and 1 twins) that ended with miscarriages. When we finally had her, I had mentally accepted that there was a high chance that she would be our only. I was so happy to have her that having only her was fine with me. Our son was a welcome surprise;
unexpected, but so grateful to have him.  
   Husband is not opposed to a third, but does worry about such a large age gap. He only asks that if we have another child, it be before we’re 40. Our daughter constantly asks me when I’ll have another baby. Our son is indifferent to whether it happens or not. 
  You would think I would jump at the opportunity, but now I’m torn. Last year, our son was hospitalized for over a week (atypical Kawasaki disease), a few of those hospital days were in PICU. He is still dealing with issues from that week+. The thought of the possibility of having to go through something like that with another child gives me a lot of anxiety; literally makes me feel sick to my stomach with panic. 
   If I choose not to have another child based off of this anxiety from a situation that could possibly never even happen, would I end up regretting it? Or if I do have a 3rd, would the age gap of the children cause issues? There are a lot of what if’s. Any perspectives from parents that have been through similar(ish) situations/experiences?

parenting,1golt65,What is appropriate and inappropriate behavior for a 7 year old boy?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1golt65/what_is_appropriate_and_inappropriate_behavior/,5,"My 26F sister 23F came to me today and told me that her 3 year old son said my 7 year old son asked him (sisters 3yo son) and my 3 year old daughter to touch his penis. This happened yesterday while I was watching her son. She said when I wasn’t in the room, which was only when I took a QUICK shower, my son asked them to touch his penis and that my daughter said “squeeze”. 
I don’t know what to feel, think, or say. 
I have ALWAYS communicated to my son that those are private areas and no one should be touching that area and if they ever do, to tell me. He’s never been overly concerned about his private areas or why it’s there, etc. He knows he pees from there and that’s about it. I’ve told him we cover it to keep our body protected because some parts need to be private. 
I think as he’s gotten older, (which happened in the blink of an eye😢) he may be more curious about his body parts but still not understanding what exactly it is and why it’s not okay for others to touch it. Another thing, he’s getting older. I am at a point where I can have a more in depth conversation with him about it but now that I’m thinking about how I will do that, I’m not sure exactly how I will word it to help him understand. We’ve discussed it every now and then that it’s private but I’ve never tried to make it seem like a shameful thing to have a private body part. He’s 7 years old, realistically he doesn’t want to stand there and listen to me talk about his penis because obviously a 7 year old child isn’t exactly understanding why it is sexualized or even what that means. My child has never been left with strangers. Never stays over night anywhere. Never goes to a friends house or someone I don’t know. He goes to school and home, that’s it. I can’t think of any scenario in which someone would be abusing him for him to think of it in a sexual way. I do know that from 7-9 they start to develop new sensations. Therefore, a new conversation clearly needs to be had. But I feel awful that this happened and I don’t know how to feel about it. I don’t know how to defend him or stand up for him right now other than saying what I just said in this post. He is getting a bit older and may be experiencing new feelings and doesn’t understand that it’s not appropriate to ask anyone else to touch him. I also don’t know the scenario that happened. I don’t know how exactly the conversations went down. It’s possible that maybe my nephew said something about his penis, as he could be curious about his at the age of 3, and it made my son feel inclined to show that he had one too. I literally have no clue. There’s no blame game here obviously, they’re all children and I really DO NOT know what is normal and what’s not. I don’t know where to go from here or what to say to my sister or how to discuss this with my son. He may feel embarrassed to talk about the situation. Do I bring it up, or just go right into talking about the privacy and boundaries we need to have with boys&girls body parts? ",2024-11-11 06:21:18

This post in meant to be informative and if I got anything wrong or you have insight please share. 

Tl;dr daughter had stomach pains in the morning but was in the fetal position in pain on Friday around 3pm.  Was at the ER by 4 and took blood and ultrasound - couldn't find appendix on ultrasound and almost wrote off all her symptoms as a bad infection because of the blood results around midnight.  Pushed for a CT scan and found the abnormalities on the appendix, started antibiotics and was sent to Boston children's around 3am.  Had the surgery at 10am. Luckily the appendix had not ruptured so we were able to leave around 3pm.  We all pretty much slept all day and night.  This morning we are relaxing shes cycling between ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  

      More details: 


For prep we took phones tablet chargers snacks drinks cash/cards for vending machines.  Wish we brought chapstick.  When I went on the ambulance to Boston wife went home and brought back her favorite stuffed animal and extra clothes sweatshirts sweat pants.   I did end up getting maybe 45 total minutes of sleep sleeping on floors using a bag of extra clothes.  Once they saw me trying to sleep they brought in an extra bed around 430am in Boston with extra pillows and blankets.  

Her pain was always in the bottom right above the hip.  This and the morning pain were a key tip about the appendix.  I typed in her exact symtpoms and timing of symptoms to chatgpt and it made some recommendations and one of them was appendicitis.  It made the most sense.  At the hospital they kept asking about her bowel movements but they were never affected, constipated, or odd looking.  She was not vomiting at all, until the first pediatrician in the ER pressed on her stomach in all areas looking for stiffness.  After that she puked aggressively until there was nothing left for about 2 hours.  And puked anything up we tried to feed or have her drink thereafter.  Nearly  Every single person we saw after she was initially seen by the pediatrician wanted to press her on her stomach.  Nurses doctors pediatricians shift managers (or something forget what she said) some specialists, all wanted to press on her stomach for themselves.  My daughter was going through hell so after the first few times I told them all no, and tell them about the CT scans and what others had stated about what they found, that they felt tension around the bottom right above the hip.  Indicated appendicitis.  My daughter had also gone through 3 different anti nausea medications that essentially did absolutely nothing to stop her from puking.  Atleast one every 5 to 10 minutes she would wake up screaming and crying in pain and nothing we could do would help until she got (spelling) toroidal?  She started that around 1am and continued onto the ambulance.  Once we got to Boston they switch to morphine for some reason.  Even though I'm sure her stomach pains were far worse, as a parent the worst thing we went through was a nurse drawing blood.  It was about a 3 inch needle that this nurse was stabbing with, while inserted about half way dragging in around inside my daughter's arm looking for blood.  From the point of insertion to finally pulling the needle out was probably 2 minutes, then they'd taped it up for an IV.  That whole thing will haunt me and give me nightmares until I'm dead.  I could talk in detail about it but it felt barbaric and something I never wish on any parent to hold their kid down to be tortured.  I wouldn't know the difficulties or tricks or expertise required to do that job, but I have to assume this person was very bad. I've has blood drawn many times and never saw them do what this nurse did.  If someone could comment recommendations or something to tell parents to tell nurses to do better or tips to help their own kids experience this with less pain that'd be great.  The one thing I noticed is my daughter's arm never looked vascular, typically they tie off up top to find a vein but this nurse didn't seem to do that.   

Not sure what else to mention. After her surgery she couldn't not vomit anything up until about 6 hours after waking up.  But even now the day after her stomach and throat is sore enough(I think) that she's refusing any foods including soft foods except water.  Her stomach hurts a lot.  Looking back its scary that we almost left our local hospital and went home with appendicitis because the appendix was too close to the surface and was missed by the ultrasound. It was all a terrible emotional roller coaster as we really didn't know what the root cause of her pains were at first.  We didn't experience any relief until after the surgery.  We had a big hug and cry after we spoke to the surgeon post on.  
 
Skipping all physical activities until she feels 100% to avoid any tears in the stitches and abs.  She can't move without pain at all at the moment (about 24 hours from surgery at the moment.)",2024-11-10 16:08:42

This is such a long story. We started dating 9 years ago while in active addiction. We got pregnant, she was removed at birth. We both separated and got clean. We did did random drug test, hair follicle test, parenting classes, psych evals, all of the above. What took the longest was building a life that was never there. A car, a place to live, jobs for a year... stability. When you have nothing it takes time to accumulate and get on your feet. He was able to get a apartment and I lived in sober living saving every dime I made working. A year later I was able to finance my first car. We did all of our supervised visits together at his family's home which meant I had to pay Uber $150 a week to meet him there. Worth it of course. We never truly broke up but definitely went our separate ways to heal. We decided it was time to come back together and shortly after courts were discussing reunification. Shortly after that I became pregnant. I was so ashamed and terrified if CPS found out, her returning home would go out the window. I made a appt with planned parenthood. On the day of the scheduled abortion I called our daughters foster mom while at the clinic. She didn't get back to me until I was taken back and already received IV access. Her words and love and support made us walk away so fast. Almost 3 years later, she's still there for me anytime I need her. She gets both girls one night a week and I watch her kids whenever she needs me to. She's an angel on earth. Just like she promised, the courts had nothing bad to say about it and our daughter came home. Now I'm 30wk pregnant and I became severely ill. I ended up having septic shock from pneumonia and was intubated and had an emergency c section. I spent two days in the ICU. I couldn't see my baby for 4 days. Foster mom was helping out whenever she could so he could be there with me. After I healed from the infection and was able to come home is when I noticed there was an issue. I was in the hospital for 17 days and they told me to take it easy repeatedly. But I had a newborn in the NICU alone. The day after discharge, I was up there. He didn't want to go with me. She was there for another 5 weeks at least and out of those 5 weeks he came multiple times but not without saying things like ""we're not going to be here all day are we?"" Or saying things along the line of what about our other daughter? Don't you care about her? Or making my time visiting the baby with him there miserable. On our 24 hour stay before she could come home, I went to the bathroom (dad had not yet fed her and it was feeding time so the nurse came in and said ""you have to learn dad, what if Mom needs a night out or needs a break?"") and when I came back in he was feeding her but was not happy and told em what she said and basically said ""yeah right, that's not going to happen"" and for a second I thought he was joking. We spent the whole night arguing. He never once helped me in the middle of the night. I resented it but I loved ever single second with her being I didn't get any of that with our first so if he didn't want to I was happy to do it. That's been 2 years ago. He's an amazing dad now. The girls love him so much and I know he loves them too. He started nights a year and a half ago and it was only supposed to last 3 months. He got accepted for day shift a few days ago and isn't wanting to take it even though it's so hard on me. I work 5 days a week. I wake up, take them to daycare, go to work, pick them up, go to the store if I have to, cook dinner and do it all on my own 3 to 4 of the nights. If I ask him if he'll take them to daycare in the morning so I can sleep in an hour he'll say yes then complain the morning of. I'm so sick and tired of it. I ask for things I do on a daily basis and he acts like I'm asking for to much. Hell tell me he's a man and needs sex so that'll happen a few times and nothing changes. Not to mention, birthdays, mothers day, Valentine's Day, the only time he's ever done anything for me is if I bring it up and he does it last minute. My birthday last year we went to Walmart to pick out a cake for myself and stood in a card isle together while he picked out a card for my girls to me and one from him from me and I fought tears the entire time.

I just found out I am pregnant with #2. Overall, my husband and I are cautiously optimistic and excited but there is something I’m really dreading: telling my three year old (who would be 4 by the time we have the baby) that she is going to be a big sister. 
My daughter is very much a mama’s girl. She is very attached to her mom. For three years it has been she and I against the world. Not that my husband isn’t a loving involved father. He travels a lot for work whereas I don’t so it just gives us more time to be together and bond. 
She definitely has what I call “big sister energy.” Very strong personality, someone who takes charge but is also very kind and affectionate. 
I know I might be being irrational as so many people have siblings and have not necessarily been traumatized by finding out they were going to have siblings. I have a twin so I don’t really have a frame of reference as It’s always been me and my brother. I am so scared of how my daughter is going to react. I am terrified that she’ll think her parents are replacing her with another baby.

As the title says, trigger warning for toddler on toddler violence.

My nephew gets violent when he becomes upset and doesn't want to share toys. He's 3 and my brother in law's kid. I have two kids, 4 and 2. My kids aren't saints but they're also not violent. It's common for my nephew to rip my kids down by their hair, shove them down, tackle them, and now he has begun clawing at their faces. Today he kicked my 2 year old, and clawed my 4 year old across his face. He was less than a centimeter away from clawing my kids eye. 

This has been going on for over a year and I'm pretty sick of it. I believe my kids deserve better than to be treated like this, and I don't want them to have to endure it any longer. I don't want there to be a more serious accident one day when maybe one of my kids eyes do get scratched, or take a shot to the head from being ripped down by their hair. 

Would it be out of line to tell my wife that I do not want them around their cousin until he grows out of the behavior? As parents we should not be putting our kids through that.

Going to add that I do not think my nephew is a bad kid. He struggles with emotions like many kids his age and will eventually outgrow it. I simply do not want my kids subjected to it.",2024-11-10 17:38:31

I hate it. I’ve hated it for years. I don’t feel like it’s as safe or secure as it once was. We’ve had it since he outgrew his infant seat. My son likes to rock a lot, especially when enjoying music. Sometimes he doesn’t realize how hard he does it. Regardless, he needs an upgrade. 

He is going on a 6 hr drive with his grandmother to meet his great grandmother for thanksgiving. Two stores near me are having decent sales on car seats (both end today of course). He’s got pretty decent car seat etiquette. Doesn’t try to unbuckle, doesn’t try to grab or reach for stuff but I don’t feel comfortable putting him in a high back booster (no harness) just yet. We have to take the highway sometimes and where we live the highway is notoriously terrible with awful drivers, pot holes, and accidents. The most he does that would be considered poor car seat practice is the rocking back and forth (not side to side) I mentioned earlier. I would feel safer if he were to stay harnessed for another year or so.

It’s also worth mentioning that I drive an average sized sedan. 2016 Corolla le. Unfortunately, this car has fixed head rests in the back seat. We do sometimes have another passenger in the back seat with him so having the car seat in the center position is not ideal.

Any suggestions would be amazing and so appreciated. Gotta get this taken care of immediately and I’ve fallen down too many car seat rabbit holes. Been looking at the Chicco Myfit but I worry because I’ve read reviews about the styrofoam head piece cracks a lot and given my son’s tendency to rock it gives me pause.

A little background, my son just turned 2 and we just finished going through a huge transition time. Up until a month ago it was mostly me (mom) and him 24/7. We were living in a small town with no programs or resources so his first 2 years has been me taking him to stores, playground, walks, etc solo. He's gone to a couple baby groups sporadically but nothing consistent. I've felt bad that he couldn't make friends his age or have exposure to extended family but we've been kind of stuck. Last month we moved a couple hours away to a big city near family so I could get a full time job and now he's going to daycare. He's been at daycare for 2 weeks now full time and he's adapted pretty quickly in my opinion. He's napping without me (what I thought would be the biggest struggle), he stops crying a minute or two after I drop him off, and he's getting more familiar with their routines. Apparently he's still not sitting at the table for lunch and he doesn't want to do circle time activities, he'd rather wander the room and explore. But considering we've never been apart and now I'm leaving him with strangers, I think he's doing great. 

So I guess the daycare does evaluations and apparently they're leaning towards him being high functioning autistic and it just doesn't make sense to me. From his first day all the staff were impressed with how gentle he is. He doesn't hit, he has amazing fine motor skills, he doesn't throw away things he doesn't want - he'll shake his head no and put it back gently. When we're at the store if something falls on the floor from a shelf, he'll pick it up and put it back nicely. The biggest tantrum we get is when we tell him he has to come inside from the yard, and even then he just melts to the floor and waaahhhhhs. 

He's likely behind on his speech. His previous doctor at his 18 month checkup mentioned that it's likely because it's just me and him. He doesn't need to speak much because I know what he wants. He can go to the fridge, point at the door, I'll open it, and he grabs his apple sauce and hands it to me to open (while saying ""ooooohhhh"" for open). But I've noticed his speech has gotten better in the past 2 weeks. He was already combining words, (""go pah"" for go to the park) and today I was playing with him with his teddy and I kept saying ""teddy attack""! When I stopped he slurred together ""teed attakk"" to try to get me to do it again. His understanding of speech is excellent in my opinion. If I give him a choice between 2 things (""do you want one more slide or go home?"") he can decide and picks one of the 2 things. Or if I ask him to get something or put something back he can do it. Yesterday he wanted to give the cat her dinner so he went to the drawer, got the right food, a clean bowl, and brought them all to her food mat to try to feed her. He also knows maybe 25% of his letter and numbers already and can verbalize what he's pointing at. We have a number/alphabet poster and if I say ""can you show me the eight?"" (Or 2 or X or M or A etc) he can go to it and point to the 8 and go ""ayyyt"".

He's not too interested in kids his own age. He's in a small classroom of 8 kids but he wants to play with the adults instead of his peers. He doesn't want to sit down and do a craft, he wants to wander (maybe he's trying to find me?). He doesn't get aggressive with other kids, he plays nicely but independently next to them. For example they had toys buried in sand and he was picking out little spiders and lining them up rather than throwing the sand or whatever the other toddlers were doing. At the park he waves at other kids/grown ups/ dogs, and if other kids try to run past him or cut in front of him for the slide he just backs out of the way and smiles at them. He's not assertive and more of a wallflower (as am I).

The daycare is saying that the gentleness and not wanting to play with his classmates makes them think he is autistic. They're even saying the way he bites food is too gentle? But all of what I know and what Google says is that autistic toddlers get more upset and aggressive and are inconsolable and struggle with change, he's doing the exact opposite, especially considering we just changed his whole world suddenly. Does anyone else have a ""too gentle"" toddler? Or experience with autism I guess? I'm maybe biased as his parent but I'm just seeing a sweet, polite, gentle soul.",2024-11-10 17:36:06

parenting,1god1o7,My 4 year old went from eating everything to nothing,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1god1o7/my_4_year_old_went_from_eating_everything_to/,0,"Hello fellow parents, I'm at my wits end trying to keep this kid from starving and I'm wondering if any of you experienced this. As a baby/toddler she was not a picky eater at all. I thought I got lucky. She ate everything from kale to mushrooms to steak. Over the last year or so she got increasingly pickier and now she ONLY eats these foods.... and only sometimes. 
She will eat:

-McDonald's sausage biscuit or a specific brand of frozen biscuit 

-Cheese pizza

-Boxed Mac n cheese, certain brands/flavors

-Chicken nuggets (chick fil a or sometimes frozen)

-Blocks of feta cheese

-Specific type of salami

-Drinkable yogurt

-Bisquick pancakes

And when I say sometimes.... she will request a specific food like pizza, but after one bite unexplainably get grossed out and not eat it after formerly eating and loving the same pizza. It's a waste of time giving into specific requests or cooking anything for her because there's a good chance she won't touch it.
This list grows smaller as the months pass. A few months ago lo mein noodles were a safe food. She'd even eat the juliet carrots and bok choy in it,  but since decided she won't touch it anymore.
She can survive all day on a single chicken nugget and air.  She's not underweight but she's at the very very low end of healyhy weight. 

What baffles me the most is that she used to be the exact opposite of a picky eater. She's also very inconsistent, loving something one day and rejecting it soon after. It's very easy to turn her off food and she will happily skip a meal. For example, if I even tell her something is a different brand or prepared different than usual (like air frying rather than microwaving) she won't try it. If I don't tell her, it's a gamble but she's more likely to eat it if she doesn't know I changed something. Or if I cut/don't cut her food different she doesn't want it and is OK with not eating. 

My almost 2 year old, in contrast, eats everything. This is how my 4 year old used to be at that age. I'm doing everything in my power so my 2 year old keeps up with the variety because the constant song and dance with my 4 year old makes our days very difficult. 

Anyone else have a formerly adventurous eater turn picky? Did they revert back or stay picky? Did you do anything to encourage them to eat variety?

The Drs warned it could signify issues with hearing or with her kidneys, but so far all tests have been normal and it appears to be cosmetic only.

We were offered surgery to fix it, but we declined it for now. We think she looks adorable the way she is. But I can't help worrying she may be teased in the future because kids can be mean. Our pediatrician told us it can easily be fixed at any time, so we had decided to wait until she was older and let her decide.

Recently, my niece (also 1 year old) had surgery to remove an ear tag. As far as I understand, it was cosmetic but I might be wrong in that. I was talking to my SIL and she said one of the factors that swayed them was that she would be be too young to remember the pain or be nervous about going to the hospital. It's made me rethink our decision. 

I wonder if she will just wish we had taken care of it earlier, but it's so hard to know. Maybe she will embrace it and it will make her more confident, maybe she will hate it and it will make her insecure.

I guess my hold up is her asking us if she wasn't perfect just how she was?

Second highest was people who let their babies sleep on their tummies from when they can roll from back to tummy (5-6 months)

Then were the parents who don’t stick to back to sleep at all and keep babies on tummies right away. 

Last, surprisingly, were people who keep babies on their backs past 8 months.

The hope is that we will come back expecting a little sibling for our daughter, as we want to grow our family soon…but we also know that if we did have another child this would be the last opportunity we would get to do this type of trip for probably the next decade. We’ve had a history of family illness which has made us not take our health for granted, so we want to make the memories while we are blessed with the health and finances to do this.

Our daughter loves her grandparents, she’s very adaptable and can be settled by most people and is definitely not a clingy child whatsoever even though she does love cuddles with us!

We also did a trial run this summer when she was 15 months old, and left her with my parents for three nights while we went away. She was absolutely fine and wasn’t distressed or upset either while with them or when we returned.

However, I’m really worried about leaving her with them for such a long time because I don’t want to damage our relationship with her or make her worry that we’ve gone away for good. I’ve read that children at this age do not understand the concept of time yet so she would not understand that we are coming back to her.

I do almost all communication with the school after our dad signed some forms to ask them to talk to me instead, which is why this is mostly my problem to handle.

Actual post with request for advice: My 4 year old twin sisters got off the wait list for the good preschool in town in late September and we moved them there instead of their (cheap but kind of poor quality) home daycare that they had been in. 

The preschool teacher asked for a meeting on Friday and she said that she has some concerns over the girls ""adjusting poorly"". According to the teacher, they only seem comfortable with other kids if the two of them are together and they won't really play at different centers separately or initiate playing different things on the playground. The teacher said that they're good kids in terms of behaving appropriately in the class and seem approximately on target with early learning readiness but that she's concerned about their social development due to how much they cling to each other. 

I have definitely also observed that they don't really like to be far apart, but I just thought it was typical for twins and little kids in general to stick to what/who they find familiar. 

How concerned should I be and how should I help them work on this?

Their teacher asked us to work with them at home on being more independent/separating from each other more easily, but I am a little lost on how to actually do this.",2024-11-10 19:48:57

My son is 15 1/2. He is texting people when he should be going to sleep eg up to 12:30 or 1 in the morning because this is the time his friends are available (different time zone). He also has to wake early (6am) for a paper round, so he’s missing a chunk of the recommended 8 to 10 hours for a person of his age.

He does complain about being tired,  and he’s a pain to get up but the morning. We’ve been through all the many, many short and long term effects of missing this much sleep with him but he doesn’t want to do anything to improve the situation.

I’m more on the side of trying to get him to understand and agree rather than force, but my wife thinks we should take his phone away  (he is saying he won’t give us his phone at 11pm). I find it very frustrating that he hears all the reasons for good sleep but then dismisses them. I want him to adopt better sleep hygiene for his own sake and perhaps talk to a doctor and see if he needs melatonin (he’s on the Austistic spectrum, high functioning, very intelligent).

parenting,1go71p1,Phrases and tips to shut down bullies,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1go71p1/phrases_and_tips_to_shut_down_bullies/,11,"My 10-year old daughter was punched in the face by another kid at her aftercare program this week (the reason he gave was that he didn't like that she touched some equipment that belongs to the program that he sometimes uses, but he wasn't using it at the time). My younger son witnessed it, and was upset, as were many of her friends, but she's not seriously injured and has bounced back. The staff dealt with it appropriately, in my opinion. 

This kid is already known to us through interactions at the park. I don't know his whole story, but it's very clear to me that his mother thinks he can do no wrong, and I have zero confidence there will be any follow-up or discipline for this kid. 

We work very hard on being a non-violent household and are in therapy programs for both of our kids to manage big emotions and impulsivity associated with ADHD. We do not condone violence as a solution for frustration or disagreement. They have both had issues in the past with physical violence and that have really subsided this past year or so. We have a very supportive school community with restorative justice programs to work through these types of things, and we always offer to have open discussions with any families who have been affected by their behaviour. This has worked well for us in 99.9% of issues. They are both great kids who do well at school and in their activities, and have strong friend relationships. 

I've begun discussing with my daughter that there may be rare times when she's permitted to get physical if the other person initiates - I want her to know she doesn't have to take shit from people and I will support her unequivocally if she needs to get physical with someone who is making her feel unsafe. There is a lot of violence in their school community, and I try to be patient with kids who are learning (and with parents who are committeed to solving the problem) but I'm at the end of my rope with a couple of kids. There are a couple who might not learn their lesson unless she retaliates to show she's not an easy target.

We're exploring some self defense options and martial arts. But I'm also brainstorming some phrases to help her shut down bullies. 

Any suggestions would be helpful! ",2024-11-10 18:19:52
parenting,1go6vyn,11 Year old's hobbies are all on screens,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1go6vyn/11_year_olds_hobbies_are_all_on_screens/,5,"My wife and aren’t sure what to do. Our son loves researching facts and stories about specific topics like the history of a hotel with paranormal history, where he documents things in Google Slides. He is also very interested in Genealogy and loves researching people’s family trees, looking up family members history and details about their lives someone might not have known (always welcome things). We love that part. He is brilliant and loves to share his findings with people and he does really impressive work.

Our struggle is he is on the computer for hours a day. He has never been into sports and we don’t have kids in our neighborhood so he is content being home, doing deep dives and engaging with people on genealogy forums. So other than an hour of PE every weekday at school, he doesn’t get much physical activity at home. We also live on a steep hill so it’s not like he just go outside and “play”. He does ride his bike around once a week, but that’s about it.

This is his interest, it’s what he’s into, but since it’s on a computer, we feel guilty that he’s on a screen so often. He’s sitting with us, in different parts of the house. Still engages with us, shares his findings and is present. But he’s on a laptop. If it was football or painting, I feel like we would be ok if he was painting and doing art for 8 hours a day.

Even if he was using books or encyclopedias or something analog we probably wouldn’t even think about it. Since his medium is on a screen, we arent sure if it’s an issue since we are all told too much screen time is bad.

We aren’t sure if we should force breaks, try to get him go outside more, or if we should just let him do his thing. He has ADHD so hyperfocus is his thing, he’s using his brain and finding creative ways to solve problems and solve mysteries. So we have been letting him just do it.

I'm a granny raising her grandkids for 3 years. Lots of trauma due to abuse and neglect. I've got sole legal and physical custody.  

The relationship with the bio parents is estranged at best. Non existent at worst. There is a lot of blame thrown at me that I stole the kids. They were removed by CPS in the middle of the night for drugs/domestic violence/child neglect. 

If I didn't take them, they'd be in foster care. It's been a rough road, but life with kids with messy, you add in trauma, it's more complicated, but we all are doing ok. 

One of my grandkids has a medical issue (deliberately vague to keep this as anonymous as possible) that may require surgery. We see the specialist next month. This kid had this issue prior to me getting custody. 

I don't have much access to those medical records and unsure how to find it as they live in another state. I attempted contacting the bio parents via phone. I'm blocked on all social media so I called their phone. 

No voicemail and no one picked up. I immediately got a message on social media telling me to stop contacting them or they'd contact the police. They had unblocked me to send it, and quickly blocked me again before I could ask my questions. 

So here is my question: do I use someone else to reach out or just stop trying? My heart is heavy, but I've got to always put the needs of the grandkids first.

We have two kids 4f and 2m.

 Maybe its because our son dosent have a certain ""thing"" yet, he just gose with the flow. Where our daughter likes barbies, dolls, hatchba mils.

But I just think they don't care to listen and then if we get upset with  them about it they say we never get to get the kids anything, why can't we buy them stuff.

He’s taken a couple spills, where he’s gotten scraped on his nose and forehead, and another time when he bit his lip going down. Both times I swooped him up, comforted him, got him inside to take a look and clean him up as necessary, and then we’re back outside ‘cause he wants to go back out! My spouse gets really mad about it, and is more “helicopter” about him, saying he can’t be walking without holding hands on the sidewalk (even though like I said it causes more instability because he fights it) and makes stupid comments about how “mommy let you hurt yourself”.

I just….I view it as part of development. What’s important is that you’re there. It’s not like he’s jumping off a roof for Pete’s sake. Yes I would rather hold his hand especially if he’s getting tired but that typically causes more harm than good while outside.

parenting,1go63lq,Managing Meltdowns as an Autistic Parent,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1go63lq/managing_meltdowns_as_an_autistic_parent/,5,"This is not specifically parenting-related, but more about navigating being an autistic partner and parent. I'm posting this a few different places to hopefully get a few different perspectives. I'm not seeking medical advice, just social/relational advice. It's very long, so thank you in advance for your time and emotional labor.

Big TW for neurodivergent meltdowns, self-harm, emotional and physical abuse, and animal harm animals.

Yeah, I know.

I am autistic, and that largely manifests as the family of traits in the Sensory Motor category of the RAADS-R (the only category that I am over the statistical ASD mean in, and I'm over it by a LOT), as well as pretty hefty meltdown triggers when I've done something wrong or disappointed someone.

One of my primary triggers is my dog. I didn't really own dogs growing up, and the ones we did have were pretty small. I adopted a very large dog (~140 lbs probably) four years ago, and for the most part, he is my big, slobbery best friend. My partner loves him, my kid loves him, he eats homemade food, he sleeps in our bed, the works. I am thankful that I have him in my life because he makes my family happy.

However, he barks. And I don't mean a little bit, it's incessant. His breed is primarily for guarding livestock from predators, but since we live in the suburbs, he guards us from everything: the neighbor taking the bins to the curb, the ice cream truck, his own reflection... Just about anything and everything is a threat that he has to keep us safe from.

We have spent literally thousands of dollars to try and train it out of him, to alleviate his anxiety, to reform his attachment to my partner to be more healthy (because he is incredibly clingy)... And while he listens better now, when he is upset about something, he will. Not. Stop.

I don't know if it's the timbre of his bark, or just how loud it is, or just how non-stop it is once he gets going, or what (we have another dog whose barking doesn't bother me) but it triggers a meltdown nearly every time.

I have been in therapy for a few years to try to figure out better solutions, and they work for nearly everything; I have sensory chews to curb the urge to bite myself, I have breathing techniques to loosen the tightness in my chest, I have songs with a steady cadence to calm me down... But none of it works with the dog, because the trigger (his barking) just doesn't stop. My initial reaction is Flight, so I try to isolate myself from him when I can, usually by shutting myself in a closet on the other end of the house, but that isn't always an option...

(TW section starts here)

When I can't flee, either because I can't escape the trigger (because I can hear him literally anywhere in the house) or because I don't catch it fast enough (because I'm working or trying to manage other stressors), I respond with Fight instead. I usually wind up screaming at him, because it's the only thing that gets him to stop. I say some pretty awful things about what I'm going to do to him to keep him ever barking again. I wouldn't ever do them, I don't think, but *saying* that I would relieves some of the overwhelm, and yelling stops the trigger. I don't really have a ton of control over what comes out of my mouth during a meltdown (my brain sort of turns off), but when I recover, I try hard to reflect on what happened and what I could do better.

But sometimes, if it's a particularly bad meltdown, I hit him or kick him. This happens much less often than it used to, since I can usually catch the meltdowns or remove myself from the situation before it gets that far, but it does still happen. I hate it, and when I realize it has happened, I tend to start spiraling even faster because I don't like hurting anyone, much less hurting him for something that isn't really his fault. Sometimes I can redirect the physical outburst into self-harm, usually biting or punching myself, but that still isn't good, even if is better than hitting the dog.

It caused significant problems for my family early on (which is what initially led me to seek therapy), and continues to cause issues even when I just yell at him. When I see my partner and kid upset or crying because I'm yelling, which is *totally* justified, I nonetheless spiral faster.

I was talking to someone the other day about their partner yelling and punching a hole in the wall during an argument, and I said ""girl, leave him, that's emotional abuse"" and was hit with the realization that I yell and hit things (and the dog) during meltdowns. Even though the intent is different, because I am reacting to a stimulus and not trying to do it as a method of control or whatever, the behavior is the same and the impact on my loved ones is the same. 

In a previous relationship, before I knew I was autistic or knew that what was happening was a meltdown, my then-partner (who has admitted on more than one occasion to triggering me intentionally because they liked to fight) would wait to trigger me until I couldn't leave (usually while I was driving the car), and wouldn't allow me to leave the situation (if I parked and got out of the car for some space, they would follow me and keep screaming). Those meltdowns/fights *often* became violent, and I am still grappling with that. It was never malicious, it wasn't controlling, it was an autistic response to stimuli that I didn't have tools to navigate...

But regardless of the why, what I did then (and what I am doing now) is still abuse. I am responsible for my actions, even if I'm not deciding to take them, and it's still hurting people I care about, even if I don't hit people anymore.

My mom has continually recommended that I just get rid of the dog. His barking is my primary trigger, and if he wasn't here, I would have meltdowns a fraction of the time, maybe even stop having them altogether (since even if he *isn't* the trigger, he is still contributing to my overall stress level, such that other things that would normally be manageable will still trigger me. Using the fork theory, he is a Very Large Fork).

I understand rationally that is probably the best option for *me*. But that isn't what's best for him, for my partner, or my kid. He would be an anxious mess (he barks nonstop whenever he can't see us), and my family would be absolutely devastated if we had him rehomed (we have discussed it before, and it did not go well). The best option for my family is that I get better at managing it, so I am trying to think of other options.

I've made progress with managing my triggers, but it's not enough, and it's impacting my partner way more than it used to (I think because they are in therapy now too, and they are addressing how they feel about my meltdowns with their therapist, some of those walls are coming down). Even though the meltdowns aren't *ever* directed at them and are relatively short-lived (usually less than a minute), the impact on them is extensive and sometimes lasts hours, and I don't think they're going to stick around if I can't get my act together. My initial reaction after a meltdown/shutdown is to apologize, because I am legitimately sorry that I've hurt them, but that *also* just looks and feels like an abuser love-bombing for control.

I am working with my therapist (and have increased my sessions from biweekly to weekly), but while she is neurodivergent-affirming, she is not neurodivergent and doesn't exclusively work with managing neurodivergence. We have made really good progress in massively decreasing the amount of times the meltdowns are physically violent, but they aren't completely gone and we are still sort of stuck on the verbal meltdowns (which also sometimes looks like a string of nonsensical expletives directed at nobody, and sometimes physical tics), which are still incredibly scary and impactful on my family.

So I guess all of that to say... What the heck do I do? Suffer the short term impact of rehoming my dog? Continue to try to figure out how to completely stop meltdowns from happening (which is a big ask) and just hope that my partner doesn't decide to pack a bag and leave (which is also a big ask)? Are there tools that other autistic adults (or parents of autistic kids) have found that worked well as an outlet to redirect physical violence that maybe I should try?

Please be honest and blunt; I generally do fairly well with the language/social aspects of the autism spectrum (I'm over the threshold but only barely, and communication, language, and psychology are a hyperfocus, which is why this whole thing is so frustrating), but I promise there is nothing that you can say that will be any worse that what I'm already telling myself, and it would be helpful to have my perspective reaffirmed if it isn't flawed, because I do sometimes gaslight myself by getting too analytical.

Thank you again for reading this whole thing. Hopefully it is all relevant and doesn't sound like I'm making excuses for the behavior, because I'm trying really hard not to.",2024-11-10 17:39:35

She mimics her friends in behavior and interests more than other kids her age seem to. Whether she’s nice and well behaved, or annoying and troublesome seems to come down to who she’s friends with it.

She’s always liked math and books, but one of her best friends of late declared she doesn’t like math, so now my daughter has started to say the same. They get to borrow a book each week in school, and she just gets the same books her friends do and then shows little interest in reading them because they’re either about princesses (not something she’s deeply into, but thinks she should like) or are too below her reading level (she reads chapter books at home but borrows simple Mo Williems stuff). Or, her letter formation has been very good for over a year, but she started to reverse a few letters, which puzzled us until we saw that her best friend reverses them the same way.

More problematically, she has started to pout, suck her thumb, and stomp her feet when she doesn’t get her way, not something she ever did before making her latest friend who does the same. She’s never been a thumb sucker, and is generally very easy going and pleasant.

Last year, after months of following a friend, she spontaneously confessed that she doesn’t like playing certain types of games but doesn’t know how to say no, so I do believe that I’m not imagining this.

Daughter (3) has had stuffed animals since birth, which she plays with during the day, but which she has never been interested in taking to bed as a comfort object at night.

But now she's waking 3-4 times every night at crying out because she's lost the dog somewhere in the covers and she wants us to come and find him. And if one of those wakings happens up any time after 5, she doesn't get back to sleep at all, and neither do I. I'm exhausted.

I don't want to tell her ""no more doggie at night,"" because having a comfort object seems like a totally reasonable and appropriate thing for a three-year-old to have, even if ours hasn't before. Any advice? Will she eventually just get used to keeping track of the dog, or not mind when she lets go?",2024-11-10 16:14:40

Since then we all have noticed an increase of her acting like a baby, presumably as the new baby is receiving attention and compliments from family. She is speaking like a baby and tries to be treated like a baby quite often. Her dad and I try to give her the love and attention while also telling her that she doesn’t need to be a baby to get it. It seems to help some but I’m not sure how her mom, stepdad, and maternal grandma are dealing with the situation so I’m not sure if that may be contributing to the continued behavior.

 It’s really only began to be a concern recently as she has started to say she can’t read and when doing homework or when she is looking at packages of products/etc she says that she doesn’t know the words or can’t sound out the words. She’s very smart and usually after some coaxing to just try she can easily sound out the words or just already knows the words. My concern is that she went from being really enthused about learning to now wanting to be kind of stagnant in order to retain being a baby and I’m not sure how to assist in dealing with this behavior.",2024-11-10 15:57:21

She won’t share her toys when they’re at her house and purposefully leaves out my 4 year old. What I can’t stand is when we leave her house and my older daughter starts acting just like her towards her sister and to me. And the thing is, I know where this behavior comes from. 

I don’t believe there’s such a thing as a bad kid, so through this lense, I understand that she mimics the behavior from her mom. She talks to her daughter in a very different way that she talks to any adult or my daughters. As if her patience goes from 50-0 in two seconds. She acts like she is a huge burden sometimes and I know that’s got to hurt my niece’s feelings. I’m just not sure how to go about correcting this behavior. She stayed the night with us last night and there were many moments I wanted to go full mama bear, which for the most part I did.

parenting,1go2ene,How do I deal with my daughter’s friend being unkind to her?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1go2ene/how_do_i_deal_with_my_daughters_friend_being/,1,"My daughter is 6 years old and has been good friends with another girl in her class (we’ll call her P) since they started school. I have always liked this particular friend as my daughter has never had a bad word to say about her. Always “P is my best buddy. I love her!” etc. but then my daughter has always been an intentionally kind and gentle girl. She hates to think she may have upset anybody and will go out of her way to make sure everybody feels included. I am of course so proud of her for all of these things. 

The issue is that while I have always struggled to make friends due to social anxiety and a few other contributing factors, in the last year or so I have become quite close with P’s Mum. We get on great and I feel very comfortable being myself with her, which is rare. As a result of this my daughter and her friend have been spending a little more time
together outside of school. Not a ton but two sleepovers in the last 6 months, we’ll car share to birthday parties every few months, they do Beaver scouts together once a week, etc. Anyway, I’ve been noticing more and more that P can be quite unkind to her when there are other children around. One on one they seem to be fine for the most part but today for example we car shared to another girl’s birthday party and P’s mum had kindly collected another girl on the way before she picked us up too. Pretty much as soon as my daughter climbed in to the back seat with P and the other girl (also in my daughter’s class) they went out of their way to leave her out of their conversations or when they would let her join in they would purposefully say things that they knew would upset her. For example my daughter loves cats, we have two at home and she loves learning about different breeds and just generally all things cats. Completely unprompted P decided to say “We HATE cats!” And she and the other girl laughed knowing that my daughter would feel sad about this. Then, the other girl decided to make it very clear that while P was invited to her birthday party in December my daughter was not. Which is fine, nobody is obligated to invite anybody to their birthday party but why make a point of saying it? My daughter got upset and felt excluded pointing out that she had invited both girl’s to her party earlier in the year. P’s mum is generally okay at shutting things down but she never really addresses the behaviour, only ever redirects. I’m not sure if this is because P is high functioning and it’s just the best way her mum can find of handling these things but the more I see it happen the less I want my daughter to be around her. There are only so many times her mum can say “Oh, P’s just tired and grumpy” as an excuse and it really doesn’t stop my daughter from feeling like dirt afterwards anyway. I even overheard P at the party later on telling another child “She’s actually coming in my car again later. She can be so annoying!🙄” my daughter was nowhere near either of them at this point and was sitting happily across the room minding her business and eating cake. I don’t understand why she’s completely fine when they’re alone together but so rude and unkind when you add another child into the mix. Hearing how horrible she can be toward my daughter when my daughter only ever says kind things about P in return has made me feel so sad and I just can’t shake feeling upset and offended by it. Can my daughter be annoying? Probably. She’s 6. They all have their moments, P is no walk in the park on a good day but I always thought she was a nice kid until recently.

I really want to address this but I just don’t know how without causing a rift in the one decent friendship I’ve managed to make in the last 9 years. Obviously, my daughter will always come first and if I have to cut ties then so be it but I’m hoping someone can offer a tactful solution before I have to consider that.",2024-11-10 14:56:00

\* Does anybody know of a good computer literacy program/curriculum for kids--whether online or book or videos or some other form? Would love to find a good all-in-one type place with info on things like: parts of the computer, basics of how it works, what is the Internet, what is email, what is an operating system, online safety, etc.

\* We are leaning towards a desktop PC for now because of wanting to be able to open it up and show the parts, etc., and also because we won't have to hear about wanting to take it everywhere and he already has an ipad that we allow for things like longer road trips, etc. The options out there are just a lot. Would like to find a good functioning desktop PC that can handle potentially some low-level gaming at some point (Minecraft, etc.) and be reliable for at least three to four years when we're likely to look more at a laptop. Any recommendations on a setup? (Yes, yes, I know there is the option to build a PC but frankly not really interested in that just at the moment as I don't have time to research components and all that jazz.

We moved into a nice neighborhood and he goes to a great school. But I am so sick of being looked down on because of my job. 

It wasn't bad till recently, being a single parent and working in the trades isn't easy but i am always there for my kid. When I can yes I go home and change and look like everyone on the street. But on days I am running late and get him in my dirty work clothes I get treated like I am a bum or like they are better than me. I brush it off most times and ignore it just so my son doesn't get affected. 

But just the other day I was late to a meeting with the school( I made it on time but was in my work clothes) they were upset cause my son used some choice words with another kid that was picking on him for what I do for a living and my son stood on business. Well I backed my son and the school said it looks bad to have him acting this way and I lost it. 

It's not my sons fault that I didn't go to school and get a degree, it's a choice I made, who cares what the parent does for a living it's all the same work till you die. But I am sick of people looking down on blue collar men and women cause they work and get dirty. It's bull shit. 

People need to take a step back and stop playing keeping up with Jones and remember that we are all here to make a better world for the kids. Not to look down on them for anything. Just be decided people and look out for one another. 

As for the school I will continue to do what I need for my child he enjoys the school and teachers so I will leave him there. As for me I will keep doing what I do and they don't like it they can transfer schools.

We’ve gotten together a couple times and I dread hanging out with them because their sons are wild. The brothers spend most of the hang outs rough housing and hitting each other, destroying rooms and not picking up, not sitting at the table during meals, talking back to their parents… last time they came over I found that after they left a lot of our toys and art supplies were broken. Their parents yell and nag at them A LOT like loud yelling from dad (BOYS SIT THE H*** DOWN) and constant nagging from mom (boys don’t make a mess) but there’s no follow through and no consequences and it has no effect on their behavior. My husband gives the “boys are just crazy you’ll have to get used to it” remark. 

So my question is, how wild are school age boys? My kids are 4 months and 22 months so I don’t have a good gauge and maybe my expectations are too high for their behavior and this is just normal? I read a lot of parenting/child psych books and it just seems like it doesn’t have to be like this!  

In the future, I want my friends to look forward to having our family over and for it to not be like this for my own son, is this behavior avoidable? 

(Edit to add when I went over and played “I spy” and 20 questions with the kids at the table they actually sat down for an extended period of time and acted like it was a novel experience. Our toddler son has huge trouble sitting at the table but we’ve worked so hard on it (with games, timers, books, etc) and he’s finally got the hang of it!)

Due to my bloodline being cursed with bad at parenting (to put it lightly), I am about to foster my 12yo relative. I have never had a 12yo before, I’m still getting caught up to having a preschooler. We seem to be the best option, and I just have so many questions and things I thought I’d have another 7 years to deliberate. 


Should a 12 year old have a double bed? I would have loved that, because I spent so much time on my bed, but is it a weird vibe?

Does she need to put her phone on the bench after bed time? How much monitoring what she does online is normal and how much is invasion of privacy? 

How much responsibility can/should I give her? I need to be sensitive that she’s basically adultified. She needs room to be a kid, but needs to learn life skills, but she’s already grown up for her age. I’m worried about taking advantage of her survival skills vs her just being on track to be a functional adult. What are appropriate chores/responsibilities for a 12 year old who you’re worried about feeling ‘worked’ when your top priority is just making feel secure, but you also don’t want to overlook that you have to teach a tiny faux-dult how to be an adult while also letting them catch up on having a childhood while they’re in the last 2 minutes of the game? 

What does daily life look like with a 5yo and a 12 yo? It is unlikely her parents will get custody of her back, but I’m also wary that it may be temporary. I’m freaking out that it may only be temporary and I’m freaking out that it may be permanent, if that makes any kind of sense. I feel like I just found out that I’m 9 months pregnant and have all of fifteen seconds to make sure everything is ready. My partner is just excited (he’s never known he’s getting a child in advance before), so he’s kind of in his nesting mode right now, sending me pictures of furniture and activities etc. I feel like the guy who goes in for his wife’s sonogram and finds out it’s triplets and starts seeing stars figuring out how he’s going to support a family of five, I’m pure panic. Are there costs I’m not aware of with a 12 year old? How much pocket money do they need? 

If anyone has 

* a basic day to day rundown of having 2 kids of these ages

*  important information regarding 12 year old girls (I remember I was one, but I wasn’t in charge of parenting myself)  

* general calming words 

I would be so grateful. I’ve got tangled-up-yarn-ball brain right now 🥲

Also if anyone has been a foster child, I would love that input of what would be wrong to do, and what did/would have made you feel secure in a new home and was most important ",2024-11-10 06:23:49

When renting kid seats you get the seats handed to you and you’re supposed to install them yourselves. You don’t know the vehicle. You don’t know the seats. And your family is tired from the trip and you’re standing there with a ton of luggage. Of course after being in a queue for a long while and the paperwork that follows. 

I understand that these companies aren’t keen to take on liability for a wrongly installed kid seat but really? Is this really the industry standard. Or were we just extremely unlucky … twice? 

Any advice or examples of rental companies that DO install the seats for you? ",2024-11-10 20:06:57
parenting,1gnuu0n,Vent / TIFU / AITA,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gnuu0n/vent_tifu_aita/,3,"I feel like this should be an am I the asshole post. It has to do with my parents setting up a full blown art, toy, play room for my two daughters, 10 months and 8 years old as well as my 7 year old niece. 

The distressing part is that after I split from my ex for a few reasons about 4 months ago, we moved out of our place and had nowhere to go. My parents and I don't get along and they refused to let me stay until I was desperate. We stayed mostly in hotels and I acquired a ton of debt. I'm a photographer but don't really work at the moment. We never got along because they are Jehovah's Witnesses, I got disfellowshipped when I was 22 and basically shunned like the amish.. pregnant at 23 and a single mom from the beginning. I have come a long way yet still battle with heavy existential thoughts, social anxiety and abandonment issues... not to mention that on one hand I am grateful of them yet also super resentful for raising me without any skills, goals, attention, typical middle class idk.. 

I just feel terrible. I knew my mom was making a play room. But my mom has a shopping problem and loves to buy things for my oldest and now my baby. The only boundary I have is that we only want stuff we absolutely need. I am flooded with stuff constantly. A new chapstick and pack of gum and goodybag, extra clothes, brushes like every week or two. I mean even when we were living out of a car for the past two months and I physically had no room to put stuff she still wouldn't get it. 

Then it hit me. The reason they didn't want me to stay with them for longer than a week was so my mom could have a giant storage place for all the stuff she's been hoarding. And now honestly I feel like wtf is wrong with me that's not true. But I think it was. Because although my baby's dad had her while I was moving around so much, I mentally was deeply struggling because I missed her so much. My oldest was missing school. I barely had enough momey to eat. And my parents said the reason was because of my poor attitude. We never really got along. Honestly I don't know why they put up with me. Or I put up with them. It was the religion. They have been so all over the place with what they accept. They said they couldn't have me over for parties or watch movies and then that fades away. They help us so much but we can't stay more than a week and they make me sleep in my car or go to a shelter.

So idk. What does everyone else do with parents who they have a strained relationship do? I wish I could just be fucking grateful but all these triggers come up. I enter this beautiful playroom that my mom has spent countless hours and money on. And I guess it's jealousy and resentment I'm feeling. Like there's no way my oldest is going to want to come home after this. And I had no idea she was going to buy so. Much. Stuff. And no her responsibility isn't to help me with my home. But since we moved in it has been a shitshow trying to setup the house. Ants everywhere, garbage piling up due to thinking the neighbors bins were mine, no couch, no dining table, no counter space, I just got a new car after totaling mine last month, getting groceries was so difficult, air mattress leaking so I had to refill it every night, no sink strainer despite buying the wrong one, etc. I mean I just feel moved in 3 weeks later since I have an actual mattress and couch, and kitchen cart today. So none of this is my parents fault but going home to a shitshow despite trying to hard to make it feel like a home and then going to my parents and into the playhouse.. felt so overwhelming. Like I felt so bad for feeling bad and I kept thinking what is wrong with me this is so nice, wait, is this the reason my mom didn't want me to stay? They let my oldest daughter stay but not me actually. There's a lot more to our relationship and I'm so grateful but I feel like my postpartum hormones just trigger the hell out of me sometimes. Maybe I felt bad because my oldest is having terrible attitude with me and I felt so overshadowed while raising them on my own with little money. Like I go out to breakfast and buy them breakfast and not me. And I walk to barnes and noble and pick out a calendar and notebook for my daughter and feel guilty because it's not in the budget. And then we go into the room and my oldest doesn't even want me to take a photo of her and has a lot of attitude problems. I feel like she resents me. I feel like I'm a terrible mom sometimes and other times I try to be grateful of having two healthy beautiful girls but I can't deal with the stress of my parents because one day they are there for me and the next they aren't and I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. I've been taking a benedryl to sleep I have so much anxiety. I honestly just miss my ex and think we split mainly because of the stress, financial struggles and my pregnancy was so rough mentally but mainly physically for me.. I miss him a lot. I don't think he feels the same way about me. Then I think why am I settling for someone who doesn't love me and is trustworthy?

I just wish I didn't react to them so needlessly. I said it made me feel overwhelmed and then my daughter will come home and not like it and I wish I could afford toys and even food for them and some other not nice things. I dont know who I am anymore. I'm so fucking lost despite doing my best. I care so much about my girls. I just want to find peace within. I feel so lonely and the only people that are consistently inconsistent are my parents. All this hyper-independence shit broadcasted as a healthy norm is bothering and confusing.I'm giving up on finding my tribe. I still put effort into keeping in touch with a couple friends but it never feels as close as I'd like. It's far apart enough that I forget what's going on in their life and have to play catchup and don't remember much anymore. My ex would say he felt like I didn't care because I would forget a lot of things, either about him or his family but he has a big family.

I have a therapist. I go on walks and listen to audiobooks. I am depressed and am considering trying meds again despite never having any luck and also having bad withdrawals because I have add and forget to take it daily and so many things.. I have been focusing on just getting enough sleep and eating enough but then everything else falls through. I need to get a job but have a baby half the time amd the other few days go by so quickly just trying to get the house and bills in order. As you can probably tell I am overwhelmed as fuck and it is trificult to feel relaxed. I also went on a date and had sex to get over my ex and the guy really likes me and brought me a heater because the heater went out but I feel so numb I just miss my ex. I am heartbroken, stressed, have depression and anxiety, dont have an appetite, feel isolated, yet I am holding it together and my girls are doing really well. The happiest I am is when I see them playing together, they adore eachother. 

I know this was about me feeling like shit about my parents but it was a nice vent. Please, let me have it if I was being an asshole or what I can do because the guilt it weighing on me. Also all the abbreviations on reddit are confusing for me and most of the time I don't look it up. Except TIFU and AITA. Also I know I need to meditate I literally can't.",2024-11-10 06:52:28

I understand that that's normal, she doesn't have the proper communication or emotional regulation skills yet to handle these feelings... But I'm wondering how do you react to their anger, specifically when they are hurting you or others?


The thing is, is that my daughter doesn't hit... I can stay calm and talk her down no problem when she's hitting. 


She will grab at your face or neck and dig her nails in like she is pinching with all her strength. This hurts like a mf and feels like your skin is being peeled off. I don't know how to react calmly when she's causing so much pain... It's the type of sharp deep pain that overrides your mind and your body just reacts.  I instinctively grab her arm to get it away from me, but I can't find the words or calmness in the moment to get her to stop... I have marks on my neck and face from her doing this earlier today.


I really don't want her to do this to other children at daycare...


I can usually calmly talk her down from whatever anger or tantrum she's having, but this... This is something else.


I've been trying to keep her nails short but she still manages to dig in. I've been removing myself when she does this and stop whatever we were doing before, but sometimes she just continues to throw an angry tantrum. 


I'm lost. Please help, what do I do?",2024-11-10 04:39:59

Even though I have my issues I’ve never directed anger at him, I’ve tried to keep somewhat of a regular routine for us, have things to bond over and activities to do together. I’ve kept a roof over our heads even though we’ve had to move sooo many times just cause of bad luck I guess. I’ve never missed a rent payment, bill payment or been a bad tenant. And as I get older I feel like I get a better handle on everything.

I’ve always kind of felt like I was stabbing around in the dark as I had no guidance and my childhood was absolutely horrific. Finally at the start of this year when he started intermediate the shift between primary school child and intermediate pre-teen really gave me a glimpse of who he’s starting to become and for the first time in my life I let myself take some credit for how awesome he is (people have always said he was so good and I was doing a good job and I would ALWAYS say hes just a really awesome kid) and honestly for the first time just let myself trust that I know what I’m doing and I got this. 

Well I’m glad we had that shining moment because now I don’t know this stranger and I don’t know what to do. We’ve always played boardgames or watched cartoons or kicked a ball or did a crossword or something and we always connected over food. Now he just wants to be on his ps5 playing with his mates or out with his mates. Which I totally get and I want him to be able to do that but it feels like he’s just getting through other things to do that.

I know I’m the parent and am responsible but I don’t want to force him to do stuff and then have him resent me. He’s essentially my only family and makes up half of my house. But I also don’t want to feel so disconnected to him. We’ve always had a really great balance in everything and it’s just been us so we’ve had great comms. I’ve never had to deal with ‘naughty’ behaviour cos we just don’t really roll like that. We’re a team cos we’ve had to be. Now I’m not sure and I think I’m the most confused since the ‘terrible twos’ haha.

How do I navigate this? What’s normal in this situation? Is it just a phase? Please be kind, I’m not here to argue with anyone I’d just like some genuine input from people who’ve come out of this stage (successfully?). 🙏 ",2024-11-10 10:13:24

Our son loves researching facts and stories about specific topics like the history of a hotel with paranormal history, where he documents things in Google Slides. He is also very interested in Genealogy and loves researching people’s family trees, looking up family members history and details about their lives someone might not have known (always welcome things). We love that part. He is brilliant and loves to share his findings with people and he does really impressive work. 

Our struggle is he is on the computer for hours a day. He has never been into sports and we don’t have kids in our neighborhood so he is content being home, doing deep dives and engaging with people on genealogy forums. So other than an hour of PE every weekday at school, he doesn’t get much physical activity at home. We also live on a steep hill so it’s not like he just go outside and “play”. He does ride his bike around once a week, but that’s about it. 

This is his interest, it’s what he’s into, but since it’s on a computer, we feel guilty that he’s on a screen so often. He’s sitting with us, in different parts of the house. Still engages with us, shares his findings and is present. But he’s on a laptop.  If it was football or painting, I feel like we would be ok if he was painting and doing art for 8 hours a day. 

Even if he was using books or encyclopedias or something analog we probably wouldn’t even think about it. Since his medium is on a screen, we arent sure if it’s an issue since we are all told too much screen time is bad. 

We aren’t sure if we should force breaks, try to get him go outside more, or if we should just let him do his thing. He has ADHD so hyperfocus is his thing, he’s using his brain and finding creative ways to solve problems and solve mysteries. So we have been letting him just do it.

So as the title says, I feel like I'm the only one yelling at my kids in this ""gentle parent"" era. And full disclosure, I have a 5yr old (the subject of a majority of the yelling) and an almost 2yr old. 

I literally feel awful for probably 75% of the day bc I just feel like I'm yelling constantly! Is anyone else going nuts with their 5yr olds?? My 5yr old is generally a very good kid, typical first born, rule follower, perfectionist type. I probably hadn't yelled at him for his entire life until his younger bro came around. And I'm sure he's having his own feelings about all the changes that have happened the past 2yrs... But he doesn't typically act jealous or anything. He started pre-k and his teachers say he's great, so I'm thankful for that lol. But when we're home it's constant - don't jump on the couch, stop running around the stove while I'm cooking on it, don't jump off the ottoman, stop f*cking with the Christmas tree, don't throw that toy at your brother. He encourages the 2yr old to join in until it's a literal mad house. Then they don't listen to all of the spoken requests to stop, until I scream and the 2yr old literally shudders in fear 🥺. TV doesn't entertain them, it only makes it worse. They're getting better about playing together/sharing now, but for a while it was just constant shrieking from the 2yr old whenever the 5yr old would take something he was playing with. I could go on and on. 

I really try so hard to keep my cool and I think it turns into a ""calm until I explode"" type situation, and by the end of the night I'm cooking dinner and I'm so overstimulated I can't even think straight. My husband isn't a lot of help bc he's typically either still working til around 6pm, or he's needing to elevate, ice or rest his ankle which he just had surgery on (which has been a long term problem prior to the surgery, so I'm hoping post recovery he'll be able to help me more). I just don't know what to do! I feel so bad yelling at my sweet, helpful, kind 5yr old, especially when I notice that he's literally frantically running around sometimes trying to help however he can think of to make things better. 

Idk y'all, I just feel like such an awful parent and like I'm 100% setting the wrong example for them in every way and even though I know it, I still can't stop it. I don't want to fuck them up and give them trauma and mental problems and then hate me when they become adults bc I yelled at them.

This is a throwaway account as I don’t want my aunt or husband to see this as I don’t want to risk hurting my husbands feelings. For context, my son was a preemie and born three months early. The little guy had a long battle for two months in the nicu. Fast forward he is now adjusted 4 months and actually 7! He’s the most spunky thing! My aunt was seemingly supportive of him and even visited him in the hospital. This is not my blood aunt , she is my dad’s brothers wife so I definitely didn’t expect this of her. We don’t live that close so she hasn’t seen my son since being discharged in the hospital. I sent her pictures since she was asking about him. I was on the phone to her when I sent her the pictures. She was quiet for a few moments and didn’t say anything after receiving them. Then one for her first things she says is “why is his forehead looking so big”. I was shocked but I played cool and tried to brush it off. I don’t know if I did right by doing this Becuase in reality it hurt my feelings tremendously. I’m not sure if she just said this without thinking or if it has to do with underlying jealousy. I’m sure everyone who has seen him has been going off to her about how cute he is (because my son is actually very adorable and I promise I’m not being his biased mom). Also her daughter decided to get pregnant after seeing my baby ( she has a history of copying me right after I do things) and now her daughter is newly pregnant with a boy as well. This will be her first grandchild too. My  son is also the first for my family. Ive been nothing but supportive of this and so happy for her.  I guess im really just upset at her comment. After her comment then she went and said aww he’s cute, I think because she might have been able to recognize that her comment could’ve upset me. My mom recently passed and I just know she would’ve loved him so much. She would’ve been all over my son. He looks like my mom and brother so I’m even more upset. She kept saying nope he doesn’t look like your brother when I said that. I woke up still thinking about what she said. Is it so hard to not be mean and just say a nice thing. How come that was the first thing that came out? What can I say if I were to voice this to her?

When we first started dating we both agreed his daughter would be the priority. She has mental illnesses (depression, anxiety) similar to me as well as extremely high functioning autism. Her and I have always gotten along (of course at the beginning of us dating she had an adjustment phase because he didn’t date anyone for almost 4 years before dating me). About a year and a half ago, she started calling me her mom as well as me calling her my daughter. I view her as such since I take care of her and pride myself on being a good mom since I didn’t have a good mother as kid and that’s driven me to be the opposite of what my mom was. Which has worked out great! Now that she’s in her late teens, it’s become… difficult. She has this thing lately where when we come back from date nights (we have rules so that if we would like to have sex, she’s asleep and not awake when we’re having sex and getting upset. This… has been an issue in the past…) she comes out of our room way after her bed time to “hang out” with us. It’s very frustrating because my partner and I don’t get a lot of time alone. I understand she wants attention and needs it but when it comes to us just wanting 3 hours of one evening twice a month- and we can’t get that- it gets very agitating. A few weeks ago, she came in and just laid on top of her father (mind you, she’s 17) and I was under the blankets with just a tee shirt and underwear like I how usually get ready for bed to sleep. It makes me uncomfortable when I’m half naked around her since I have had sexual abuse happen to me as a child and I don’t want her to have that happen. I’m sure that sounds crazy, but it makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable to be half naked around my child and I avoid it AT ALL COSTS. Her and her father, my partner, know this. 

So when she comes in and I’m half naked under blankets and express I need to use the bathroom and she just lays there staring at me, it makes me uncomfortable. My partner asked her to turn her head and look away and I quickly scurried to the bathroom while she laughed. It made my heart ache because i do what I do to make me comfortable and keep her from dealing with similarly to what I dealt with. 

Now, to present day. I had stripped down to my undergarments and I noticed a spider in the bathroom asked my S/O to bring it outside (It was just a wolf spider and I don’t kill most house spiders unless it’s HUGE- I get nervous about spiders. Another weird thing about me- sorry). I went back into our bedroom and sat on the bed then stripped the bed while my S/O took care of the spider outside. Mind you, I’m still practically naked. As I’m putting the stuff in the pile my partner walks in, attempts to close the door, and our daughter pushes it open anyways and walks right in. I jumped and ran into the bathroom and I heard her laughing and just going “Oops”. 

I don’t know what to do. She keeps coming into our bedroom unannounced and I only asks she knocks in case I’m changing, getting ready for bed, etc. because it’s my safe haven and she’s at that age where she should understand that- and she does! Her and I have had conversations about how bedrooms are safe havens and how knocking is important because whatever one person is doing in there isn’t really your business. I rarely knock on her door unless it’s time for dinner. Half the time I just text or call out to her so that she knows she’s needed and has time to finish what she’s doing to come in. Meanwhile, she just opens the door and walks in. This is the second time this has happened in two weeks as well. I screamed one day because I had just gotten out of the shower (I took my towel off because I was in the process of putting lotion on) and she just walked into the bedroom! She keeps doing this and yet she STILL won’t knock and it makes me so crazy uncomfortable! I partially feel guilty because I know she just wants to hang out or talk but 9 times out of 10, I’m doing something and don’t have time to do a task and give her all of my attention. I always let her ramble about her special interests whenever we’re together. I, as well my partner and I as a team, keep explaining that when the door is shut- you HAVE to knock because that means we’re either doing something or need to decompress.

I asked them what time he is suppose to be there and they say ""Anytime as long as you pick him up before 6pm"" When I take him to the daycare in the morning the class looks fuller but when I pick him up the majority of the class is already gone. I guess most of the parents pick up their kids earlier or they have a different work schedule than me.

I've also noticed that they seem upset when I show up to drop him off but happy when I pick him up. It makes me wonder if they think my child is difficult and are afraid to tell me. He is 14 months old. The last time that I picked him up one of the workers made a strange comment saying ""He was good. He didn't cry today."" I'm unsure what she was trying to imply when she said that. And no my son doesn't ""always cry"" but when he does cry I've had people in the past (NOT the daycare workers. Just other people) complain to me that he is loud. It makes me wonder if he's louder than the average kid his age and that maybe I'm just use to it cause my whole family is loud and I grew up in a loud house. And no he isn't sick and he isn't allergic to anything. He is teething though. He's got a lot of teeth and still has a few more growing.

In one of my other posts I also mentioned that I've had a couple of times where the workers IGNORED ME during drop off. One of them was busy on her phone and the other 2 just stared at me as if they were in some kind of trance while I spoke to them and then they didn't even respond to what I told them.

I'm starting to also wonder if they think my son is difficult or if they think he has behavior issues or something and are afraid to tell me. Either that or they just think I'm a terrible mom. ",2024-11-10 08:13:52

My daughter is a lovely girl. She’s 3.5 and truly a blessing. She’s very kind and loving. Very smart and funny as well. She doesn’t have tantrums and she’s easy to negotiate.

The one thing I’ve been struggling with is defiance.

Example: she’s drinking her milk and I explain her 1000 times to not turn the bottle otherwise milk spills. Then she looks at me and does it, laughing and gets milk everywhere. So I have to get her pijamas changed.

This is just one example. Another example would be she hits me with a stuffy and I ask her to stop, she looks me laugh and keeps going.

I’ve been struggling a lot with it and have no idea on how to deal with it.

Do you have any tips for me?

Thank you very much",2024-11-09 19:40:58

I have been in a very loving and nurturing relationship with an exceptional man, we are now expecting our first child together and both have 1 child already each. 
I have (in the last few weeks) started to see concerns over my partners basic care needs of his 6 year old daughter. 
My partners brother has just been released from prison after 3 years for a long list of offences, including knifepoint robbery, abuse, violence etc. in the 4 weeks since his release he has been verbally aggressive towards me (threatened me and called me vile insulting names), my partner stopped contact for about 1-2 weeks but then picked up contact with his brother again. This caused arguments between us as I felt let down by him. The brother has also smashed up his parents tv in a blind rage over money (potentially for drink and drugs), been verbally and physically aggressive towards the mother......... infront of my partners child (who was scared, crying and shouting at him to stop), caused fights and trouble at a public event we all went to (he was heard asking for drugs, he attempting punching someone, punched the hotel door windows, took his top off and ran down the streets shouting and swearing aggressively), has punched the father and caused the mother to want to end her life. 
24hours after the awful event mentioned above, my partner allowed his 6 year old girl to stay at his mother and fathers house were his violent brother lives. I then told him to go back to his parents house and stay there. I was absolutely disgusted that he would allow her to stay there in such a vulnerable position. I brought all my concerns up to him but he doesn't seem to see how she is in any danger. The family claim it is the brothers adhd and autism that causes it all but, even if that is the case, this does not mean he is not a danger to the 6 year old. 
I have genuine concerns about his basic parenting skills and am concerned not only about his daughter but my unborn child.

I know is a damn red flag with me not working and ya i am staying with my in laws. They are the old gen types of thinking and they dotes on my older kid so much till they do everything for him, including basic needs like showering and feeding him food etc. FYI he is a P5 kid. As for my other younger girl, i train her to do things on her own and i will just be by her side to guide her and help her ONLY when needed.. 

I talk this things out with my man and he said “i have things to do and i am always running out of time. If only i have time, i will train him but i will just do things for him if time is not in my favour”. 

And to him, he thinks i am always the free and eng one, every time constantly playing games and do nothing. But in fact when he is not around, things move smoothly when there is no one to stop me from doing my duty like both kids willing to shower on their own, go to bed early. I must own up when my man is at home, the house is so much 'lively' and 'noisy', kids end up showering late at night which means they sleep late. But when he is not around, it is so much peace and quiet, which i really was very looking forward to. 

So what i really dying to ask is, am i really wrong for training my kids to be independent? Am i wrong to like pushing them to die? 

Can’t i have a little bit of my own self time to relax myself? And nowadays pp often said self care self care. Or is it i care too much on what 'others' say or i care too much on others rather than caring myself?

I am a step mom. 5 years ago, I met my now husband and his children. His children's mom and him were not together. 

For over 3 years she stalked me on every social media platform, tried getting me fired, tried canceling our wedding by impersonating etc. Biggest thing was when she went to my old home, dug up my backyard claiming there was a spell jar that I made that contained a love Potion and that's why they weren't together. 

Fast forward quite a few years of her withholding them, and the FL legal system legitimately not caring, she had another baby with another man and decided she would let us see them, now 10 yo and 11 yo girls. 

Fast forward 3 months of on and off visitation on the weekends to our 1 bedroom apartment, last week, she was bakeracted. The girls now live with us, in our 1 bedroom apartment, going to school in another county. 

We went from having a childless, quite home, to having 2 very angry and confused teens who hate me and tell me all the time they want mom and never want me as a step mom. 

Thier mom had NO rules for them, but also didn't feed them dinner, didn't check their school stuff. Not once signed a form or submitted paperwork for anything. The girls are failing, have missed 12 days of school in 4 months and are at a K grade level in reading and writing. 

I, was a nanny. I only know how to be a nanny. I don't understand how to not have rules and stick by them. I don't think the rules are that bad but my husband (i think feels guilt) so he undermines me and if I say no, he will tell them not to tell me and give them whatever. We obviously need to speak and get on the same level....but it's driving us apart. 

The rules I have? No bullying people,  1 koolaid and Capri sun a day, the rest of the day water. No cookies or Halloween candy before lunch. Wash your dishes, put up your clothes, get changed, brush your teeth, no gymnastics in the very small living room, no summersaults off the couch, dont pull the cats tail, no YouTube (they only want to scroll endlessly and watch inappropriate videos), no R rated movies. 

How do I let the eye rolls, mean words, and obvious projecting over the situation roll past me? Like how do I just suddenly become a ""step mom"" and grow patient? I have to literally go for a walk to make sure I don't go off the handle over what I think is disrespectful language or blatant attitude.

Mid-30s couple, 4 month old kid. Currently having a major disagreement with the wife about how to split care on the weekend, centered on early morning wake ups. 

I work an intense job with long hours (55-60 hours a week). Wife is currently on leave, so she takes on majority of care during the week. We did nighttime shifts when we were in the newborn trenches, but for the last month and a half kiddo has settled on a pretty regular schedule: 830pm bedtime, 6am wake up. 

During the week, we both wake up at 6am: she cares for the baby, and I take the dog out, make breakfast and coffee, and start my workday. I also do all the bedtime duties since she’s tapped out on baby stuff by evening.

Weekends is where we are having our disagreement. She thinks that since she wakes up with the baby every morning M-F, I should wake up with him on Saturday and Sunday so that she can sleep in and “recharge” for the week. My take is that the weekends are both of our days off, and we should each get one day to sleep in. It’s not like I’m resting during the week either, and I haven’t had a single day where I’ve slept past 6am since the baby was born. Frankly I’m also running on fumes at this point. 

Anyway, we can’t see eye to eye on this so I thought I’d ask for other opinions.  Am I totally off base for asking to sleep in one day a week? How can I communicate this need without her going crazy?",2024-11-10 05:53:33

To make the preface short, my 4 and 2 year old kids have had some pretty major back and forth adjustments recently. We had to leave our home due to Hurricane Helene, lived with my in laws for about a month, and moved back home this week. My two year old is unfazed. She adjusted well to be away from home and then moving back in.

My 4 year old, who has always slept through the night, has recently been waking up around midnight each night. He says he's afraid of his room and can't sleep in there. I just let him crawl in bed with us because it's easier than fighting him to sleep in his own bed. Before we had to leave home, he rarely, if ever, slept in bed with us. But once he's in bed with us, he's back out again until morning.  

My husband hates this. And, look, I get it. It's uncomfortable. We have a queen bed so adding another tiny human makes it very cramped. I see this as a phase that my son will eventually grow out of, and I soak it in while I can because one day he won't need to crawl in bed with us for comfort. My husband just sees this as an annoyance and his rebuttal is always ""how long are we going to let this go on?""

I feel like it's going to cause more damage if my husband continues to be insensitive to my son's need for comfort. He's 4, he can't help what scares him and he certainly can't regulate those feelings of fear yet either. I even offered to make a pallet in our room and my husband said absolutely not, that he needs to sleep in his own room in his own bed.

I have my son in counseling next week for some behaviour issues and I fully intend to bring up these recent changes. So there's that. And he has all new furniture in his room because his old things were ruined. So I know that there's the adjustment to coming home to find your whole room has been replaced. 

Currently my husband is on the couch because he threw a hissy fit when my son woke up just a bit ago. So, what do I do? How can I make my son feel safe and supported through whatever he's dealing with on the inside and help him with this new transition, while also making my husband happy and our bed less cramped?

Meltdowns, maybe? He's considered nonverbal, he's been evaluated, concluding not to be on the spectrum, but he's selectivity mute, which makes communication very challenging. He does have a communication tablet but by the time hes starting his episode, its too late to ask him to use it. The tantrums usually starts with me saying no to something, or telling him to wait for something. He starts by going limp, sliding to the floor, for some reason he feels the need to completely undress, that's when I step in and try to keep him from pullinf off his clothes, cause I don't want him on the dirty floor without clothes. Thats where it climaxes, to him screaming, not even crying, kicking, flailing around like a fish out of water, I'm petite so I struggle to keep him in my grasp, the screaming goes on for about like 10 minutes sometimes and I'm just at a lost at how to calm him without even having to get to the point of me crying and him still screaming.

I've heard that kids who start school, you have to expect some tantrums, but I don't know if that's related. I've started doing time outs, but it's hard to tell him why he's in timeout if he's absolutely not listening. It brings me to tears cause it feels like I'm doing something wrong. The only way I've figured to let him have a his episodes is by having him on the bed, so if he's throwing himself around he doesn't hurt himself, I have to listen to him screaming until he finally stops and he pops up and seems nothings happened. I try my best to keep my head up and set baoundries, but I can't if he doesn't want to listen to those boundaries. 

We're a gaming family, so he loves playing the games my husband and I pick out for him, that is what I take away for misbehaving, I can't tell if it's actually working. To clarify, my husband works 5 days a week, so I'm home alone without help, I'm left to do 90% of discipline. Is this a phase, or is there something I need to change in my parenting?

He is very close to me and I to him. We do everything together from going to the store to mowing the lawn. But he is a very active child and while I’m hesitant to say misbehaving that’s what he’s doing. I know he is testing boundaries but he doesn’t respond to anything but shouting. I’m sure this is normal behavior for a 2 year old, but I’m concerned my behavior is not normal. 

I don’t want to spend my time disciplining/teaching him by shouting but I am struggling to find another way to get him to listen. Maybe I just need to wait it out until he hits another level of developmental growth. 

Also, if I’m being honest with you all and myself I at times take it too far. I don’t mean violence or anything like that, and I don’t just go off the deep end because he spills milk or something but for instance today he headbutted my wife who is pregnant and made her nosebleed. This is out of character for him and not a common thing but just using it as an example. I told him “what the fuck is wrong with you have you lost your mind you don’t hit people” and put him on timeout. But I mean I really yelled it. I felt the anger in the words and I know he did too. I don’t want him to feel that kind of anger from me. Normal discipline or disappointment sure but those words and the way I said them almost had hatred in them. I have no feelings of hatred or resentment toward my son but how can he understand that at such a young age ? How can I get him to listen without screaming?

I feel terrible about it. I need to find a way to get through to him without losing my cool and it seems like it’s a vicious cycle of my patience being worn down and my behavior creating an environment where it riles him up. 

Please tell me what you all think

For the record once it was all over I sat with him and told him that I was sorry I yelled like that but he needs to not hit mommy and that I loved him but I wasn’t very happy with the choice he made.

parenting,1gncf2v,Advice on parenting a teenage boy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gncf2v/advice_on_parenting_a_teenage_boy/,22,"So I recently gained guardianship over a family member, he is 14. Sometimes I feel at a loss and in over my head. I love this boy with all my heart but he has had little structure in his life and my idea of parenting is way more strict than my idea of aunt-ing. I know he feels like I'm unnecessarily strict, but I want to make sure he grows up with some semblance of structure and guidance... something I never had. It's so hard to go from the fun place where rules barely exist to rule city. I'm stressed and trying to talk to him is like talking to a brick wall at times. We are getting better now that he has been with me a little while and he is learning his new home life routine but you can just tell that he was just left to his own devices too often previously. I shouldn't have to tell him to brush his teeth every single night, that should be learned behavior at this point...but here we are.

I'm trying to figure all of this out, but just being tossed into it is kinda hard. How do I know what a proper chore and allowance routine is? I never had an allowance growing up, what's a proper amount for a 14 year old?

I get concerned with his phone time, but he never had any restrictions so I feel like I'm invading his personal space. 

I could go on for days on the things I feel I don't do right, but I'm doing the best I can. I know I'm doing better than my own parents...but is it enough to keep him from going down the same path as his father? I hope so. Luckily he has a great demeanor and isn't confrontational, he really is a good kid with a kind heart. I just feel lost sometimes.

Any advice or support would be great ",2024-11-09 15:23:36

My partner is a great, hands-on dad who plays a lot with the kids, changes diapers, cooks and also gets up at night. Basically, I can't complain.

I would like to know how other parents deal with going out. I go out with friends about once a month in the evening (dinner and drinks). However, I'm usually back between 10 and 11pm so that I can support my partner at night (baby wakes up 2 - 3 more times, even more often when he's teething). My husband meets up with friends about 3 times a month and always stays out until 2-3am. When he is at home, he sleeps soundly and doesn't hear the children. It doesn't bother me how often he goes out, just how long. How do others handle that?

We don’t use physical punishment, and traditional timeouts haven’t really worked for us. We’ve been trying consequences, like taking away something she enjoys when she misbehaves. It worked for a little while, but lately, she doesn’t seem to care about the consequences at all.

She starts crying hysterically and fights getting in her carseat. She's reaching and crying for me and doesn't want to leave. 

Dad resorts to bribes or lies to get her in the carseat. He will tell her if she gets in he will buy her ice cream or take her to the park. If she gets in he says he will buy her a new toy or say whatever else she likes in order to get her in his car. I don't like this approach and it rubs me the wrong way. When she struggles I try to validate her feelings and let her know it's okay to be sad and I try to talk her through it and oftentimes it helps. 

Sometimes he will tell her that I'm going to meet them there, at his house which is not true. I don't agree with lying to her. He came to pick her up today for an overnight and she was upset, so he said, ""Get in and mama is going to be there."" I expressed that I don't want him to tell her that because it's not true. He said. ""She'll understand."" I told him that I don't pick her up until tomorrow night, so he responds back, ""Well, so you will be there."" I said that I don't want to give her false hope and have her be upset when she realizes I'm not coming today."" He said. ""You won't. I'll be giving false hope."" I feel defeated when trying to talk to him. 

I also tried addressing something else. She was crying because she didn't want to go with him, so he told her, ""You're being a bad girl. Do you want to go in time out?"" This crushed me. How can you punish a child for feeling upset about a transition? I brought this up and he immediately said, ""I don't punish her for it."" I mentioned what he just said to her and why I think it's important we don't punish her for struggling with it. All he said was, ""That's fine."" In the end he said he wasn't going to ""sit here and have you nit pick everything."" 

My heart hurts for our daughter and I'm at a loss of what to do. I'm not trying to nit pick, but I do think it's important to address these things. I'm defeated because he doesn't seem to care and there's nothing I can. Does anyone have any advice? We are still in the temporary orders phase of our divorce process. ",2024-11-09 19:03:39

I'm sure we both knew It was going to happen sometime. We just didn't know when. We tried to avoid it coming to this but clearly it was inevitable.

It was just a series of disagreements and resentment and I tried to brush them off alot of the times, (I'm sure he did too) just for the sake of keeping the peace coz of our baby but eventually it became so exhausting. So after something so little I just burst out and I just couldn't stay a minute longer. It was probably more about all the resentment that had accumulated over time than that specific argument.

Right now I'm looking at my baby and he just looks duller than usual. It's probably the change of environment. I'm so worried he'll start to feel the distance. He was so used to his father and my heart just breaks for him cause I really wish It was possible to hold on just a little longer. 

I really do hope that his dad tries to keep in touch cause I haven't blocked the access. I just feel bad for our little boy. I really wanted a present dad who's in his daily life for him.

It would probably be a little bit easier to handle but I’m also 35 weeks pregnant so I know the hormones are getting to me. Our situation is unique in the sense that my husband has a 5 year old from a previous marriage and I love him like my own but he calls me by my name. I’d never pressure him to call me mom but now that my biological kid is old enough he’s calling me by my name too and I’m the only one that enforces him calling me mom 100% of the time. It’s pretty heartbreaking to work so hard for the mom title and to have my own little boy for him to not call me mom (I get he’s little which takes out the sting a little less) but this coupled with him just fully rejecting me lately has been hard. He doesn’t want to hug me or cuddle me but he will dad. He doesn’t want to play with me but he will with dad. I can leave the room for however long I want but if dad’s gone for two seconds he is screaming bloody murder. That’s where we are today. Dad went to go take a shower and he was screaming for a solid 20 minutes banging on the door. Every time I picked him up he would throw himself out of my arms. He didn’t want anything from me he just wanted dad again like always so I lost it. I yelled at him which I feel like a piece of shit for and went in the bedroom. Now his dad asked what happened and I explained how I feel rejected and it feels like he doesn’t love me. How it hurts so much to want to have a mother son bond with him but for some reason he doesn’t want me and his response was “I don’t know what to tell you. You can’t yell in this house I work hard to afford. What if our neighbors heard and it becomes a problem with the landlord. That’s unacceptable.” I get I shouldn’t lose my shit but sometimes it’s too much and in that moment I felt helpless. Like I wasn’t even able to console my baby so what good am I? Like what am I doing that’s so wrong that my own kid hates me so much? Am I wrong for feeling rejected? Is it normal? Is it the hormones? ,2024-11-10 03:38:12

So to preface, I’m already assuming my 3.5 year old son most likely had ADHD.

Does anyone else’s kid go nuts around dogs? My son is not unkind to them. Contrary actually, he loves dogs. But it’s almost like they’re a trigger for him to act like a beast. He’ll chase them, pet them roughly, try to “squeeze” their face while saying I LOVE YOU YOURE SO CUTE. He absolutely will not leave family dogs alone. He doesn’t do this to random dogs obviously lol but my mother in law has two small dogs and my God… they’re like crack to him. No matter how many times we tell him to leave them alone (they’re old) and to just PET them, don’t try to engage them in play, he just doesn’t listen. Sometimes it’ll go too far if he’s REALLY amped up and he will pull on their tail or ruffle their ears to get a reaction out of them which we ALWAYS address. He helps to feed them and walk them so he adores them. It’s almost like the dogs are a drug to him….",2024-11-09 23:00:42

I genuinely want an open discussion, and to see other perspectives. 

My husband and I agreed that Santa won't be ""real"" to our son. We will still have fun with Santa as a fictional character, we just don't want to have him believe that Santa is a real person. I've seen a few people share a post saying something like ""Santa is real in our house. Don't let your kid ruin it"" (idk if thats exact wording, but it's essentially that) 

I would never want my kid to ruin it for other kids. He is only two right now, but this is something I want to have a plan for in the future. I am going to do my best to teach him to respect other people's beliefs, but I also don't want him to have to be left out of conversations because of it. 

My issue is, how do I go about this? Just tell him that some kids believe in Santa, so he should pretend like he does too? I don't think he should lie to keep the peace, especially when he knows that he's protecting a lie. 

And then there's the problem with presents. If one kid from a rich family gets super expensive, extravagant presents from ""Santa"" and other kid from a poorer family gets clothes or something from ""Santa"", the second kid may wonder why they aren't good enough for the cool presents. 

I've never understood why we convince kids that Santa is real anyway. Whether my kid tells your kid or not, they're going to find out eventually. Why lie about it? Again, I promise I'm not asking in a judgemental way, I genuinely want to know your thoughts.

While we were paying for the bill we got an alert our backyard camera went off. When checking it was the sitter sitting on the swing on the phone. Odd as my kids were alone in the house, we kept watching as my 6 year old comes outside to ask her where she was she yells screaming “go inside now! I’m on the phone!” This happened one more time and then she yelled in Spanish “bye you little asshole”. We immediately called her and asked her to get back in the house we were pulling up. We told her to leave and called her parents to tell her what happened and we were shocked they were just like oh ok. 

We asked our kids about the night and they told us at one point she had left to go home to get her iPad leaving them alone! And that pretty much the entire time she wouldn’t talk to them or respond or get them a drink etc just on her phone and then went out back and they had no idea where she was that’s why my son went to look.

I went back to school to change my degree. My daughter does half days at daycare while I study. My husband works full-time. I am the primary caregiver. 

Several times a day, I go into the main house with my daughter because it's a larger space and it's nice to say hi to my parents. My parents don't watch her often. Only when I have an errand that requires two hands or for special occasions. When I come home, she always seems like she's in the middle of a good time and I get good reports from my parents. 

Here's the weird part. She screams every time she sees my dad and like half the time that she sees my mom. I thought it was surprise but I started announcing that they were coming before they enter the room and she still screams. She asks to visit them everyday but when we walk in there and she sees them she screams. They're both really nice people. They raised me and I don't have any major concerns about my childhood. I suggested that my dad gives her a couple of Annie's bunnies when he sees her. 

I feel bad for them. I don't like going through the cycle every day. What's going on?",2024-11-10 00:53:11
parenting,1gnolqf,"Still in overnight diaper, recently incontinent during day",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gnolqf/still_in_overnight_diaper_recently_incontinent/,3,"So, my son is 6 years old (almost).  He was toilet trained at 2.5-3 years old.  In jk he was terrified of toilets (auto flush and air dryers) so he struggled for the first half of the year with accidents.  Then no issues.  My daughter was born a month after he turned 4 but no issues other than the usual behavioural adjustments. 

 In SK, around October/November 2023 he started having pee accidents during the day, up to 1-3 times per day.  We finally got him in to see a specialist, they checked for UTI and did an ultrasound no concerns.  The specialist said we could do meds, but there are side effects and we need too retrain his bladder by getting him to go every 2-3 hours.  This was Aug 2024, we had success up until recently (3 glorious months).  He's started having accidents, which instead of immediately cleaning up he sits in it (which has been his MO the whole time)... He also pees thru his diapers in the morning.  He wakes a bit early and reads.  I think now he's afraid to go to the bathroom by himself due to a new wolf fear (fear of dark).  So I think in the morning he wakes and pees in his diaper, it leaks as it's full from the night.  So tonight, i go to make his bed before bedtime and there's a huge pee stain, looks old.  

I'm so frustrated, we will try again with the 2-3 hour pee schedule, and hope it works.

Oh, I forgot to add that even those he's not constipated we do give him activia yogurt as I notice sometimes he has an accident and then needs to poo right after.

My question is, did I miss an overnight diaper ending?  And now he's just used to peeing in his diaper overnight and it's translating to daytime?  There may have been a few days here and there he was dry overnight but nothing regular.

Also, yes he always pees in the morning and lawyas pees before bed.

I'm so fucking frustrated with disgusting pee clothes and sheets.  I just want this to be done!!",2024-11-10 00:48:29
parenting,1gngzee,How to encourage daughter to tell us about symptoms? ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gngzee/how_to_encourage_daughter_to_tell_us_about/,13,"My daughter already is pretty quiet about how she is feeling when it comes to her health. I can think of only two times when she has been sick enough to actually slow down and rest when she’s ill and both of those times were with stomach bugs. Otherwise, she will try to power through any cold or flu and rarely tells us about symptoms. 

Two days ago, though, she told me that she felt something weird on her neck and wanted to go talk to her doctor about it. I made an appt, we went, did bloodwork, scheduled a follow-up ultrasound, and went about our day. Last night, at bedtime, she told me that it hurt her to talk, yawn, or breathe. She didn’t have labored breathing, but she said it was hurting enough that she was having trouble falling asleep (def out of the norm for her). Her doc said it might be a good idea to go the ER. One reason for this advice was that, when we had asked my daughter if she swallowed anything weird, she had replied “I don’t know.” 🤦‍♀️ So I took my daughter to the ER and her x-rays was clear. No foreign object lodged in her throat. 👍 After that, I opted to wait until the scheduled ultrasound appt next week since her symptoms hadn’t worsened while we were there. 

My husband was sooooo angry this morning. “ER was a waste of money, so dumb, blah blah blah.” My daughter heard him reacting and now she’s saying nothing hurts and nothing ever did hurt. Meanwhile, we got her bloodwork results and SOMETHING is definitely up. We def need to do the ultrasound and probably more bloodwork. But now I’m worried that my daughter won’t tell us about any of her symptoms because (a) she didn’t exactly love her ER experience and (b) it clearly angered her dad and caused an argument this morning. 

How can I fix this?? 😬 How can I encourage her to keep telling me when she feels unwell, especially when my husband is giving off the opposite vibes? Is there a kids’ book that talks about the importance of telling a grown up about how you’re feeling? ",2024-11-09 18:49:53

She has always been an ""I can do it myself"", ""I want to decide"" kind of toddler, but at 1 and even the early 2nd year it was manageable. I gave her like two choices she'd pick one and that was that. NOW?! I just spent an hour and a half trying to get her to bed because after we've ticked everything off of the list, brush teeth, potty, water, story and finally to put her to sleep she claims she needs the potty again when she just went 5 minutes ago.

 If it's not the potty it's I need to drink water. When I tell her she just went she starts crying or trying to negotiate with me saying ""okay mommy how about this? First you take me to the potty then I'll go sleep,that's all see?"" Like no. You're just gonna sit there and smile at me because your stalling tactics have worked. Then she ends up crying sometimes screaming if I say no, no more potty and ask her to lie down and go to sleep. 

It's not just at bedtime. She fights me with everything and HATES her daddy right now. Even the choices I give her  are never what SHE wants, I'll be like you gotta wear a jacket so whats it gonna be the white one or the pink one? This is followed by her saying i don't wanna wear a jacket and crying. I put it on her anyways and ask her to help zip it up. She says no she's too mad to zip it up so i do it, she cries because guess what? She wants to zip up the jacket. 

I don't  know what is going on with her or how to help her. I'm expecting baby no2 but it's still very early, and I am still doing everything I did with her and more but a lot of people seem to think she's sensing a change is coming or something and that's why she's acting up. I just think she's showing me a glimpse of what's to come during the dreaded threenagers. She's been keeping me guessing a lot, I'll think I know what she wants and suddenly she's like ""nooooo-wuhh not thaaat"" you just said you wanted it. What do you mean?

She's currently laying beside me sleeping and I truly wonder how I'm going to cope when we have a newborn too.  I don't try to push down her fiery personality She's talkative, hilarious and just really fun to be around, but wow, right now, she's also really hard to figure out.

I just need to get something off my chest because I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed and alone. I gave birth to my baby in the 29th week of pregnancy, and she’s currently in the NICU. The experience has been incredibly tough, and I’m still recovering from a C-section. The surgery was hard, and I’m dealing with a lot of pain—physically and emotionally. I thought it would get easier, but it hasn’t, and every day feels so heavy.

I’m doing Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) with my baby to help her, but it’s so painful for me. Sitting in that hard chair for hours is hurting my back, and I’m still sore from the C-section. But I keep doing it because I know it’s good for her, and I want to be there for her, even if it means suffering.

I’m also feeding her every hour, even though I’m exhausted and sore. I just want her to gain weight and get stronger, and I’m giving everything I have to make sure she does. It’s heartbreaking to see her in the NICU with all the wires and machines. Every time I leave her, it feels like a part of me is still there, and I’m constantly worrying about her.

The worst part is that my husband doesn’t seem to understand the pain I’m going through. He says things like “C-section is easy” or that I didn’t carry her for nine months, and it really hurts. It feels like he doesn’t see or appreciate what I’ve been through. I honestly feel like carrying my baby for nine months inside me was easier than seeing her in the NICU, hooked up to machines.

I don’t want or need his help, but I just need him to understand what I’m going through. I’m doing everything I can for my baby, and it’s taking everything out of me. But I just feel like he doesn’t get how hard this is for me. All I want is for him to see the pain and effort I’m putting into this journey. It feels so isolating to carry all this on my own.

Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you cope with your partner not understanding your pain? I just need some support and to feel heard right now.

my son is 3 years 2 months now.

I guess it is a time kids start picking up ""ABC"" alphabets and ""123' Numbers.

Correct me if I am wrong here.

I find very hard to get my son's concentrate for even 10-15 minutes while teaching him at home.  I am using a learning paper printed with numbers and alphabets and I help to identify him what are they and what they look.

He can tell ABC to Z if he goes with flow and have to sing. Same goes with numbers from 1-20. But, he cannot identify them individually. We want him to identify them as well. 

One of my friends son is 6-8 months younger than him, and he identifies whole ABC alphabets and 1-20 numbers.

I know every kids are different. But, am I missing any tricks here or are there any other better way to teach kids to learn letters.

I live in GA and make $13 an hour at a fast food restaurant. I thought what I was getting paid at my restaurant job was good compared to what I use to make at my former jobs. But I'm shocked to find out that some of the babysitters make more than what I make at my current job. And they also make more than what I made when I use to babysit for my mom's friend when I was younger. When I was about 19 I got paid $20 a DAY (I wasn't paid by the hour) and watched their 6 year old daughter for about 5 hours on Saturdays. After seeing how much these babysitters on reddit charge I'm realizing I seriously got ripped off when I was a teenager. 

I also figured that maybe what the babysitters charged also depended on how many kids they were watching and how many years of experience they have. And also what the cost of living was where they lived.

I live in GA and minimum wage in GA is $7.25 an hour. The fact that babysitters make more than what the majority of restaurant and retail workers are making makes me wonder how parents who worked with fast food or retail were able to afford babysitters or daycares. 

I use to think that babysitting was a first time job for high school or college aged students. But I'm shocked that some babysitters make more than what a lot of my friends and coworkers made at that age at restaurant and retail jobs. If they really do make that much then I'm surprised that a lot of restaurant and retail workers in my state haven't quit their jobs so that they can start babysitting. ",2024-11-10 06:24:11

He got to the point where he would trigger without us even reminding him for ~1-2 weeks and no accidents until 10 days ago.

10 days ago, at pick up from his school, the teacher said he had an accident earlier in the day and then when we carried him he was already soiled again - thinking he must've just had an accident. We went to the washroom and changed him. We thought it is just a one-off and told him it's not a big deal and he's doing well. This week, a similar thing happened, but it seemed like the teacher was not paying any attention to him and he was in his soiled clothes for a while - what triggered me to think that it has been a while was because the room was dry and they found that the wet spot was outside (they were playing outdoors >30 mins before). I am not sure if the school isn't paying much attention to him and that's affecting his confidence or was it something else that started it all.

My husband has a blue collar overnight job and I a sahm so most of the parenting and caring for the kids has always been my sole job in our household. Both have cell phones. Originally my husband and I said 12 is a good/ reasonable age to get them phones, but my December baby started middle school before then so the rule is now when starting middle school they can have a phone (we also have a 9yo daughter). Their friends that they’ve grown up with in school got phones in elementary and I just could never get on board with an 8/9/10yo having a cell phone so when they begged and pleading I was the bad guy for saying no. Okay, I’ll take it. 
This change was for my comfort, so I could make sure to keep location tracking on and if god forbid there was an “incident” I would be able to reach them and get them to safety because I have a lack of trust in law enforcement since Uvalde happened. We knew when they got phones they would want to use sites that their friends use (Snapchat, Facebook, instagram) eventually, I understand that the new generation is very social online. But I also recognize the dangers of it and have told my kids that a conversation would need to be had about it to discuss the dangers of it, how to be safe on there, cyberbullying etc. Both of my boys recently (in the last year) violated that rule and broke trust. My older son is generally more calm and reasonable than my middle child, so when I doled out his “punishment” it resulted in some extra chores and him pouting for a couple days without his phone. We had a long conversation about it and I told him if he wants to keep his instagram it needs to be on private and I need to be able to see the page, and he needs to be honest with me if he gets any weird messages or people trying to follow him that he doesn’t personally know. I told him I don’t feel comfortable with him having Snapchat or Facebook because those are more dangerous. I haven’t had any issues with it since then.

Now to the issue. My middle child has a mind of his own. He’s very free spirited and sometimes impulsive, but he’s also a bit of a follower and does/says things that mirror his friends behavior for the sake of being cool (idfk). Keep in mind, I’m not super invasive, I don’t go thru their phones daily, or even weekly because I believe in respecting their privacy and their personal belongings. I verbally pry to know what’s going on in their lives because teenage boys do not think their mom is cool enough to talk to anymore I guess, and I do have access to their phone passwords and emails. I had one of my streaming accounts attached to middle child’s email and needed to reset the password so I log in and I see emails from twitter and facebook. I click on the twitter email and sure enough, it’s a post of some woman promoting her “spicy” account, and it says “people you follow”. So of course this prompted a thorough phone check, and I found him on twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat all behind our back. He said a friend told him about girls “photos” on twitter and he got “curious”, okay sure buddy. He felt very ashamed, cried and apologized. I told him I don’t see him differently and I’m not judging him for making a mistake, and that I also understand it’s a part of growing up and he will come across those things even if he’s not actively looking for it so I keep those apps off limits for that reason. I told him that pornography is not okay for a boy his age or even his brothers age, and it can have damaging effects on his little mind. I’m not against pornography, but for my teenage boys absolutely. I don’t want them thinking that it’s realistic, because these *are* paid actors. 

So this all went down over the summer and the result of this was heavy restrictions on what he can access on the phone. I set screen time limits that restrict the web browser, apps rated over 13+, and the phone locks at 10pm because shocker, he’s on that damn thing when he’s supposed to be sleeping for school. Recently he brought up wanting to have instagram and I just don’t see the point in it at all. It’s a hard no for Facebook, Snapchat, and now twitter. He communicates with his friends on texts, FaceTime, and Xbox chat so I don’t understand what he’s lacking and why he feels like he needs social media.

I am a teen mom. I had my oldest at 17 and have very little familial support other than my husband and two sisters. I don’t have a lot of confidence in my parenting, I’m honestly just winging it so I need outside opinions. I want to hear father’s perspectives because I’ve never been a boy and I know there’s a huge difference in raising boys vs girls. I want to hear teens perspectives on what they feel is fair. As well as moms, I need mom support because I don’t know what I’m doing 😅 I’ve talked to my therapist about it to get her perspective too, but I just want to hear from other parents and kids personal experiences as well and make educated decisions. I have a tendency to be a helicopter mom because I was a neglected child so I’ve had to assess that and work on it in therapy. My boys have told me I’m being overbearing about not letting them have social media so i don’t know what to think. Help please 😬 
Also if we could keep the teen mom shaming to a minimum, that’d be great. I’m sensitive, I will cry. Also he’s 14 so there’s nothing I can do about it at this point.  ",2024-11-09 14:57:23

She talks all day, narrates what she's doing and all her thoughts, ask the same questions over and over or says the same word or phrase over and over. If she runs out of tings to say she makes up words or just makes random noises. It makes it really difficult to do things like getting dressed, getting out of the house etc cause there are no natural pauses to say things like ""put your shoes on please"" and she does not stop talking when asked to. Just ignores us and keeps talking louder. She can never remember to use her inside voice.

She is really fidgety, can't stay still, frequently falls of chairs cause she's spinning around. Something on her body is moving all the time. She chews toys, her hair, fingers and nails. She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Mostly because she can't stay still and silent. We need to lie next to her for hours to help her fall asleep.

She destroys toys and things because she is never careful with anything and fidgets so much. And it is like she can't stop herself if she gets an idea even if it is something destructive or something she knows is not allowed. For instance running away outside. Or annoying other people. 

She seems unaware of her surrondings. Runs into things, trips and falls. Knocks things over. Pulls clothes down from hooks. Picks on things without thinking about it. Touches everything. Goes in to cabinets and drawers and scatter things about. Empties all the toys on the floor without playing with them. Our house gets so messy and it is so difficult to get her to tidy.

She seems to need an extraordinary amount of adult attention and is unable to play by herself for more than a couple of minutes. It is so difficult to get chores done while she is awake.

Her sight and hearing is fine. She gets lots of exersise, fresh air, healthy food, sosial interaction and limited screen time. We try to be loving and autoritative parents. She has friends and family. She has always been like this. She functions a bit better other places than at home. 

She loves books and can stay focused when we read to her even if she asks lots of questions. In most situations she gets easily distracted, espacially if there are a lot of people around or a lot of things happening. She gets angry easily.

We did recently invite the other child to my daughter’s birthday party with no response from sending the invitation to school. Since this just happened on Friday I feel like I need to take action on Monday to talk to the school, maybe the principal, but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting with my mama bear protective instincts coming out. I’m absolutely not okay with that being said to my daughter. She said she didn’t respond and wanted to go cry on the bench afterwards, but just continued to play with her other friend. She’s a sensitive little one. I’ve talked to my daughter about the situation, but I feel like a conversation needs to be had with the other child and parents. Even if the mom didn’t say that, I’m sure (I hope) she’d want to know her daughter is saying terrible things to other children.

They were playing a silly ear touching game on the bus when their kid quickly stuck their hand down our kids pants above underwear but right above the front private area and then pulled it back out.  Our kid immediately said was going to tell parents what happened.  Their kid responded that they would never be able to play at their house again or with their younger sibling. Our kid got off the bus and immediately told my spouse what happened.

The neighbors came over the next night with their kid and apologize.  The parents themselves also said some kind of awkward things which I'm taking as an attempt to quickly move on from the situation. We made it clear to them that its going to take some time before we all hang out again.  We have only known them for maybe 6-8 months since they moved in.

We reported to the school but not pressing further investigation. School counselors talked to our kid and they said seems ok, were proud of how brave they were to speak up. All good things there. They moved their kid's seat on the bus to be directly behind the driver. We also heard that they got a call for a group counseling session with their kid. Not sure the result of that.

At this point a week later our kid is good, seems happy at school still and not nervous at the bus stop. We're happy with the response from the school. My walk back with the neighbors after drop off is awkward. They say things that indicate they want to move on like offering to play on the nearby playground instead of the house.  Its a bit frustrating to hear so soon but we've kept our cool in those conversations.

We'll probably never feel comfortable with the two of them being alone together for like, forever.  At the same time they are our neighbors and were fun to hang out with before all this.  Our plan is to give it a month or two and see how we feel - but honestly concerned the trust will never come back for us.  

I guess given all that I'm just looking for some anonymous online perspective on this situation because its all so crazy.  Are we responding too harshly to this 7 year old's actions by indefinitely keeping the kids from getting back together?  At the same time, if they weren't our neighbors at the same freakin bus stop its a guaruntee they would never see each other again outside of school.  Had their kid not threatened maybe this would be easier, but we keep thinking about that as a major red flag.  Help us work through this please!",2024-11-09 21:22:46

parenting,1gnu711,Glad my parents weren't there to comfort me everytime.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gnu711/glad_my_parents_werent_there_to_comfort_me/,5,"I’ve come to realize that parenting has a profound, lasting effect on a person’s personality, choices, and relationships. Psychologically, when children grow up overly dependent on their parents for problem-solving, they often carry this dependency into adulthood. They’ve been conditioned to seek validation, advice, and comfort from their parents instead of learning to process challenges independently. This pattern can be seen in those who habitually turn to their parents for reassurance about friendships, romantic relationships, or even major life decisions, creating a cycle where they never fully develop self-reliance.

Many of these parents may not seem controlling outwardly; in fact, they might feel they’re doing what’s best. However, what’s happening is often what psychologists call ""enmeshment,"" where boundaries between parent and child are blurred, and the child is unintentionally trained to feel that parental guidance is essential for every decision. This dynamic builds a strong psychological hold, instilling a belief that deviating from their parents’ views will result in failure or disappointment. Over time, this fear and dependency create a deep-seated anxiety about making choices without parental input, which undermines the child's confidence in their own judgment.

This unaddressed dependence can affect relationships later in life, too. It has been noted that people who haven’t healed from these dependency patterns often project these unresolved needs onto their romantic partners. They expect their partners to take on the role their parents once did, to step in and “fix” everything, fulfill all the expectations, and provide the same emotional security. The partner, who may not have signed up to be a “rescuer,” finds this hard to sustain, and it often strains the relationship. This is why understanding a person’s upbringing is essential for healthy relationships. Our early conditioning profoundly shapes our behavior, attachment styles, and emotional patterns.

Growing up is about recognizing these patterns, learning to identify what was once useful as a child but may now hinder personal growth, and embracing independence. It requires challenging yourself to make decisions, face difficulties alone, and break free from the comfortable cycle of parental reliance. Without this growth, life can feel frustrating and unfulfilling. People often cling to a “safe” life, avoiding hard choices and seeking constant reassurance from parents. This is known as “learned helplessness” a pattern where an individual avoids difficult situations out of a belief that they aren’t capable of handling them, choosing comfort over growth. Unfortunately, every time they avoid a challenge, they miss out on the opportunity to strengthen their resilience and problem-solving skills.

For real, lasting growth, individuals must actively choose to put themselves in situations that demand accountability. Making decisions independently and accepting the consequences teaches valuable lessons and fosters a sense of self-efficacy the belief that you are capable of managing your life and its challenges. Recognizing and breaking free from dependency is not about rejecting the support of loved ones; it’s about building a foundation of self-reliance and resilience. True independence means that while you can cherish and value the people who support you, you’re also able to stand on your own, make empowered choices, and handle life’s difficulties with confidence.",2024-11-10 06:08:08
parenting,1gnrtal,Co Sleeping,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gnrtal/co_sleeping/,5,"I'm sure this subject gets brought up a lot. I have a 9 about to be 10yo. I have such a hard time getting him to sleep in his own bed. He tries to slip in, in the middle of the night, sometimes a few times and get in bed with us. Sometimes my wife will pull him to her side and put herself in the middle and allow him to stay. He will ask to go stay with his grandmother so that he can sleep with someone. 

I absolutely refuse to co sleep. It almost offends me. I met my now wife when my stepson was 3. My wife co slept with him until we moved in together and got married. I had a hell of a time getting him to sleep in his own bed. I think it took me about a year. My wife doesn't fight me on the topic but she doesn't help much either. 

Sometimes she will sleep with him in his bed. I have tried to explain to him now that he is older that I don't like sharing a bed with him and that our bedroom is for adults. I even went so far as to explain a little about adult time and that it's very private and that's why he can't be in there. He said well when you and mom are done then why can't I come in.

Both my mother (genX) and my husbands boomer parents can’t follow simple instructions. 

For example my husband and I do not eat junk food / processed food we are very strict on our diet and especially what we feed our children. I have everything I need to feed my child but yet both of our parents are persistent on buying chips or cake or other things to feed them. I just don’t understand. I keep saying we do not eat that stuff and they are both like it’s not that bad it’s “all natural” which most of the time is just green washing on the package and it’s full of garbage. Or 60 grams of sugar like holy crap my kid weighs 35 lbs they don’t need all that junk! 

The other thing is we don’t let our kids use the phone to play games or watch tv and any chance they get they put on the phone for them. Just last night my mom was insistent on my husband and I going out so we did and we come home and my mothers asleep and my 3 year old daughter is wide awake at 10 pm still watching a show on her phone in the bed next to my mother. 
E
It’s just the level of neglect this generation was ok with just baffles me. Really I let my kids be free play in the mud, be naked in the yard just be kids, they don’t need all this extra garbage food and television all the time. Why are they just so obsessed with giving it to them … genuinely I’m curious if other parents have this same problem. 

Edit: I want to clarify that I do make my children homemade cake and cookies but we do not eat already made food that has additives and preservatives since people think I’m raising my children with no access to enjoying a piece of cake at all. 

And all the commenters from that generation explained it to me in the comments. They just can’t deal with boundaries. This isn’t just with grandkids but we have seen this across the board on how they can’t respect our boundaries and they never set any with their parents and just suffered through being walked over their life so they expect us to do the same. 

Also to add about free babysitters. We live across the world from our family and they come to visit. So we definitely aren’t relying on them for free babysitting 😅",2024-11-10 06:19:50

I’m waiting on the results of her full neurological assessment. 

We have also been dealing with SH for over a year although it’s gotten better. She was in residential for about 40 days. PHP for about 3.5 months. And IOP for about 3 months. 

We have decided to not enforce her cleaning her room since it was a huge catalyst for us fighting. 
She lives with me full time, her father, and step mother and half brother and step sister. 

She has no respect for the parent/chile dynamic. Will refuse to go to school. Abuses her phone privileges, install apps she isn’t supposed to when screen time is disabled. Sending and receiving nude photos with friends etc. she will argue about everything and say and share inappropriate things with us and others. Like she doesn’t understand civility and unwritten societal rules for appropriateness. It’s not so bad as to think it’s an infliction, just oversharing stuff parents are better off not knowing. 

Connecting with friends is obviously needed for mental health, but she abuses every visit with them or every tool used for communicating. 

She is sexually active and self admitted to her therapist if by hypersexual/sexually obsessed and lacks self preservation with a real disregard for consequences, when she told me she was ready to have sex we got her on birth control, but if I’m not there in the morning or if her routine is altered missing her morning meds isn’t uncommon. 

Thankfully she has never been sexually abused although neglect and verbal abuse did happen when she used to go her mothers and her mother was battling meth addiction. Her mother has never set boundaries and it flipped the mother/daughter dynamic to some degree when my daughter was the parent which has transitioned into a more friend/friend relationship. 

I’m basically her only parent who can and does parent which clearly causes a resentment toward me and all her anger and aggression fall on me. 

Disciplining has become almost unnavigable at this point. If I’m not 100% rigid and strict she will use those exceptions to argue until she is blue in the face about how she shouldn’t be punished and it should all be reward based. Everything is black and white with her and she doesn’t understand the nuances that come from raising, teaching, loving, and disciplining children. 

The phone addiction is real. And I’ve yet to figure it out. When discipling I feel like anything I do is going to lead to self harm. Her relationship, while slightly better now, seem to be consumable and the people she does maintain friendships with are one who encourage bad behavior, seem to normalizing self harm, and who vape and supply vapes. 

I’m mostly venting, she has a great therapist at IOP and we meet, her, I, and her therapist, once a week. On top of her normal sessions with him. But IOP is ending in a week and the thought of her being home  every evening instead of being at IOP makes anxious and filled with guilt and shame that I’m dreading being around my daughter more. I’m damned if I do and I’m damned if I don’t. 

It’s just very difficult and totally foreign compared to raising her older brother and two younger siblings and I feel hopeless, clueless, and stressed all the time. ",2024-11-08 14:48:32

His Dr was never concerned because he talks fine, it's just the way he talks. (I know I'm doing a terrible job explaining this.) For the last year or so, he's cut most words down to just one syllable, but not necessarily the first or last syllable in a word. Examples: he called a caterpillar a ""pill"", an ambulance ""am"", the dish washer is ""the shh wash"", blanket was ""ank"" 

At his 3 year check up, his doctor suggested that I annunciate words and put emphasis on each syllable to help him start to understand that words are often more than just one sound. So when he repeats part of a word back to me, I'll pause and say the whole word slowly. And it's improving his speech more and more every day. 

However, he's recently started adding too much to words. He used to call Bluey ""Luey"" but now he says ""Blooby"" and he used to call bologna ""lonely"" but now it's ""ba-low-bee"" ambulance is now ""am-be-bance."" And it's got me wondering....

Is he adding extra ""B"" sounds to words because I'm putting all this effort into correcting his speech? Or is this just part of the learning curve?

Spread it on a hot waffle and it melts quickly. If some drops on the table, you can pick it up with your hand, and it just leaves a spot you can wipe up with a napkin. ",2024-11-09 17:36:52

From what I’m seeing online, these ball pits are intended for 6 to 10 months. Is that accurate?

A lot of things that I hear throughout the day is ""I don't like you"" ""I hate you"" ""You f4ck"" and a lot of other thing but those are the main ones. All I'm doing to get these responses are telling them no to eating cookies for breakfast, telling them they have to have all their clothes they threw on the floor picked up if they want to play and do fun things for the day and other small things. We don't have a lot of rules in the house but we have the usual no throwing, fighting, screaming and slamming doors. 

I'm at the point where I just want to cry my eyes out constantly because it's nothing but screaming and yelling when I ask for anything to get done. I understand that they're little but at the same time I won't tolerate the constant disrespect for the people and things around them. I've tried the whole gentle parenting and that ended when I had a car thrown at my face. I've tried running a tight ship and at least things get cleaned up when they're done using them but it's so draining to constantly hover and hover to just get a small task completed.

I get it that theyre little and that they don't want to clean up, they want to just play and get into things but I just want to be able to walk through my home without tripping on a gazillion toys, actual trust them enough to use the damn potty without them getting on top of counters or into the pantry. I dont want to be constantly hated in my home for wanting something so simple.

EDIT: I was extremely overstimulated this morning when I originally posted, and after a breakdown and a phone call with my mother, I have calmed down immensely. So, to elaborate on a few things. I do not expect a show house, but I don't want to dance around toys in my kitchen trying to sort out food nor should i have to fight with a matress just to get to the bottom of the stairs. We really don't have many rules and the main rules that we have are that we can't go outside without an adult and we don't touch the microwave or oven without adult supervision. Everything else falls under the expectation of living somewhere, staying off the table, counters, not spraying water all over the counter and floor whether in the kitchen or bathroom, slamming doors, smacking windows, throwing things at walls and leaving dents, just simply cleaning up after yourself. As for the swearing, it's a hot take that not many will agree with, but I have always allowed my children to swear as long as they use it properly. Now the only time they swear is either when something really cool happens, they drop something or something bad happens and then you'll hear a small ""Oh sh1t"" out of the oldest. So the ""You f4ck"" is the only other time they swear. (Maybe they swear more than that but I've never had a teacher or babysitter ever say otherwise)",2024-11-09 13:41:02

Our daughter is 8 years old. She signed up for a weekend language and cultural school (she’s half Korean) that is 13 weeks long. When she signed up, we explained in age-appropriate terms that she has to commit for the session, and if she never wants to do it again at the end, that’s fine but she needs to at least see it through. It costs is money, etc. I also did this as a child so I remember my own complaints but I did it for years and I can read/write in Korean thanks to it. 

Well, she’s been complaining about it since the second week. Here we are more than halfway through. This morning when we need to get ready, she starts saying she doesn’t feel good, she doesn’t want to go, why didn’t we tell her it was going to be like this. She doesn’t have fun, honestly she doesn’t put any effort in, has a shit attitude which is actually a problem in other areas of our life and not just with this course. We validate her emotions and perspective while reminding her of her commitment, it’s almost done, we’ll do something fun later, reward her at the end with a prize, blah blah blah. She kept pouting today until she started crying, full on 8 year old tantrum. I can’t drag her to the program like this so she’s been in her room, told her she has to stay there for the duration of the class today. No fun activities. She’s not being rewarded for her shit attitude and tantrum. 

I get that 8 years old is still young, but I think it’s old enough to learn greater life lessons about seeing things through and dealing with discomfort. Imagine if we bailed her out every time she was uncomfortable or not enjoying something. This is one of the few times she’s had to really apply herself to something that doesn’t just come easy. 

For more background - she has this weird inflated sense of self. For example, she is naturally athletic but never wants to try a formal team sport or receive coaching, yet she will say she is the best at whatever sport, she can do X Y Z, even saying she is as good as Olympic athletes (while we were watching the Olympics). Like WTF narcissism is this? I get that young kids are egocentric but this seems more than typical?? 

I don’t know. Can you tell me, are these attitudes and behaviors normal for an 8 year old or do we need to be more vigilant to keep her from developing some personality disorder as she grows into adulthood?🥴

It was her decision and it was really hard on our son. We’ve remained friends and hang out, BUT my son struggles with the custody arrangement. 3 days with me and 3 days with his mom.  We live 5 mins from each other so it’s not a long drive and he’s in the same area, but ultimately he likes living with me more.

He is always happy to come to my house but he struggles with wanting to go to her house. Partly because he has a nicer gaming set up at my place, but he still has a good one at his mom’s as well. 

I am pretty gentle with him about the whole ordeal and always welcome him to stay as long as he wants here.  His mom is pretty strict with her schedule as she makes plans with friends and stuff. Even if I’m busy, I’ll cancel plans to let him come stay with me if needed.  I know it’s her right to do as she wants with her schedule, but my son notices it.

Regardless, she take it’s pretty personal when he gets in the car and seems upset and she doesn’t mind showing herself being upset about it. I haven’t said anything to her except asking to be gentle with him. But sometimes I want to tell her to quit showing herself to him when she is upset at him. He didn’t ask for us to divorce and he had no say in how he splits his time with us.  He probably feels out of control and anxious that he just has to go with the flow and not feel like he has a stable home.

He just got in the car with her after being at my place for over a week. She could tell he was bothered, and she started acting annoyed and upset as well. Now I’m stressed because I could see tears building in his eyes and he told me he was anxious.

I texted her and let her know how he was feeling and her response was, “interesting…fucking cool.”


Should I not tell her when he is upset and why he is? I’m not sure what else to do. She won’t budge on the schedule and so I just accommodate it for her to keep the peace. But if I had the choice, I’d let him live with me full time so he can feel more stable.

He is currently struggling with depression and anxiety. And he is addicted to alcohol. The behavior from alcohol addiction has been escalating and effecting the family more. I have been given countless chances (dealing with addiction for 7 yrs, married for 14 yrs) and have realized that I now have to prioritize my peace. 

We have two girls 10 yrs old and 7 yrs old. The youngest is extremely attached to her dad and this will break her heart. My oldest has anxiety issue and very sensitive and feels like she is not enough all the time. 

What’s the best way to tell the kids? I believe honesty is best but it is so complex. I don’t even have all the answers myself, for instance, how long will dad be gone for, where will he go, why does he has to leave if you guys love each other, why can’t he just stop drinking, why don’t we talk it out, etc. These are some of the things that I know my daughters will ask. 

How do I approach this on the best way possible? Is it better to talk to both at the same time (10yrs old is more mature than her age while 7yrs old is less mature than her age). Should both parents be present? Or should I talk about different things at different time as to not overwhelm them - like explaining what an addiction is first.

Her tablet has been gone for over a week and when she does have it she’s only allowed it for an hour during quiet time. She has now started slamming her door. Kicking the floor. Throwing stuff at the walls and on the floor. My best example is today - Every Friday she gets home from school and we look at her bring home folder and she snatched a paper from me and told me she wanted it. I told her to hold on and you will get it when I’m done looking thru her folder. She then storms off and throws her water bottle at the floor and slams her bedroom door. I take her water bottle and tell her not to slam my door and once she calms down she can come out. She has been screaming in her room for over 40 minutes and I’ve told her Once you calm down you can come out and get water. That’s all. Just stop crying and being a brat. She sits in her room “crying” and will open the door yelling at me to give her water etc. I shut the door and tell her again once you’re done you can come out. She knows the rules.

I'm starting to introduce solids to my 7-month-old baby and would love some advice!

Should I:

*Option 1: Homemade*
Buy fruits and veggies from the grocery store/farmers market and blend them myself
Pros: freshness, control over ingredients, cost-effective
Cons: time-consuming, potential nutrient imbalance

*Option 2: Store-Bought*
Buy pre-made baby food from the store
Pros: convenient, nutritionally balanced, easy to store
Cons: preservatives, limited flavor options

What are your experiences with introducing solids? Did you opt for homemade or store-bought? Any tips or recommendations?

Some specific questions:

- How do you ensure nutritional balance with homemade food?
- Are store-bought options reliable and safe?
- Any favorite recipes or brands to share?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Edit: I'm particularly interested in puréed foods for now. And I would prefer store-bought because me and my SO both work full-time and we switch shifts.

I want to share with you the things I have ""disregarded"" and ask you to be honest with me, am I/did I overreacting/overreact? 

Note: we have just had a civil, calm, adult conversation in which he raised the point he thinks I am overreacting and that the below are the things he and his parents think I am being too much or too overprotective on. I am happy we managed to have a conversation without arguing, however there is yet to be a resolve.

1. Baby was born while boyfriend's family were in South East Asia, and his family wanted to meet baby as soon as they got off the plane 

My reason: I thought it was common sense if those who had just hopped off a plane from a two week holiday take some time to settle back in their home country before meeting a newborn incase they were ill/not aware they were ill, especially with COVID still floating around. Midwife also informed me this is not a good idea.

2. No kissing baby, which his parents have already done despite knowing this was one of my basic ""do not do"" rules

My reason: RSV, danger to babies health which in severe cases can result in baby becoming permanently ill and in worse cases, die. I had done my research prior to birthing baby, also not midwife recommended.

3. No spraying perfume around baby, which his dad continued to do after both boyfriend and I told him this is not a good idea

My reason: backed up by research it is not a good idea as the chemicals can cause an allergic reaction as it did to my baby. He broke out in a red rash across his face.

4. Did not want to attend boyfriends Father's birthday party

My reason: Baby was 7 weeks and only had his BCG vaccination. RSV peak season. There was a lot of people at the party.  I had been worried as baby was kissed by his side of the family before. We ended up going because it caused a great deal of arguments, and boyfriend promised me no one would be kissing baby. Baby ended up being kissed twice, once by boyfriends grandmother, once by his mother who was drunk. It was baby's first time travelling in a car for so long, he vomitted from car sickness and it was a hellish drive getting up there which caused aruments in the journey up. Baby was asleep due to exhausting journey for the majority of the night, his mother kept telling me ""the family MUST meet him"" basically pressuring me to wake him up. Prior to this, I had fallen asleep while putting baby down as I had 2 hours sleep the night before. Boyfriend kept coming to wake me up telling me his family was asking for me. I went down after i had had a plate of food but boyfriend took my behaviour as not wanting to be involved in the party. I even apologised to a lot of his family I had fallen asleep. Boyfriend kept saying I never wanted to go to the party anyway, and for the above reasons regarding baby's health. ",2024-11-09 05:21:41

My son is going to be 4 in December. My wife and I are having a really hard time getting him to take to potty training. 

He seems to have 0 interest in it, everyone tells my wife you can’t force it and it has to happen at the child’s pace. We’ve bought all kinds of potty training stuff like a fake toilet with liners, a travel pop up potty, a potty training watch that beeps every hour or whatever, potty training books, games, sticker boards, and washable pull up underwear. 

He has no interest in wearing the watch, refuses to wear the pull up underwear and insists on diapers. 

To me it seems he’s taking the path of least resistance. He’a able to effectively community to us when he pooped in his diaper and I honestly think it’s like a game to him at this point bc he kind of makes jokes about it. 

At this point I have no idea how to approach it, i have to be at work by 7:30am and don’t get home until 5:00pm so I’m not home to assist my wife. She feels defeated by the whole situation. 

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How did you get your kid to get past their insecurities/fears of using the potty? ",2024-11-09 14:40:02

It was supposed to be just a sleepover party for the kids but somehow turned into a party with the parents friends. The situation was... well it has caused us to feel it isn't necessarily safe for our daughter to go over (definitely never staying the night again), certainly uncomfortable, and grossly inappropriate.
How have you other parents dealt with letting your child know you aren't okay with them going over/staying the night anymore? How did you explain it? Did you talk to your child about if their friend asks?
We know to be careful with how we talk to her, none of this is her fault and we don't want her to think she's done anything wrong. Even with that I worry that not letting her go over anymore may cause her to not tell us things in the future, any advice for that? Or is that a hope for the best kind of thing?
The parents have my number but in all honesty I couldn't care less if it got back to them that we aren't okay with her going over anymore. Our child comes first.

When they are tired they cry over everything (they nap 3 days of the week but don’t nap the other four which is where a lot of tiredness comes in) admittedly, we do our best to get them to bed on time, so that even without a nap they’ll be fine, but we miss the mark many night dealing with our youngest. Anyways, we are working on that but I’m mainly concerned about what they say when tired and I’m wondering if this is normal?

Examples:
“I’m upset I have to go to bed. I wish I was in a different family” (passes out within a minute)

If we ask them to share a toy with their sibling close to bedtime and they refuse, we say let’s just be nice we have to go to bed soon. They’ll say “I’m a bad person, I’m a bad guy”

“Everyone is the best and I’m not. I’m not awesome”

Their teacher made an off handed comment when one of the other students did something well and the teacher said oh you’re the best! So my kid thought that meant they weren’t the best. They then made a plan to wear their best outfit so they’d get compliments and everyone would say they were the best. I was … surprised at the level of calculation there tbh",2024-11-09 14:28:35

The doctor gave us medicine to help stimulate his appetite. 

At this point, I want to scream. Food goes to waste, he's not gaining weight, he's half the size of basically every kid his age. Idk what to do. I'm genuinely at my breaking point.

How do I get him to eat?

I can barely get him to consume one serving of pediasure, and now I'm supposed to get him to have 3 servings of that a day.

I need to take a breath, but I also need my three year old to stop starving himself. I'm trying to not let it stress me out, but it's definitely starting to show that his not eating is STRESSING ME OUT. And so I know my stress isn't helping.

Okay. I might not respond anymore, HOWEVER, all of your comments have helped me calm down and come up with a better game plan. I really appreciate you guys taking the time.

I will definitely be requesting a referral for therapy, behavioral and feeding therapy. I figured I might need more help, but reading your comments has helped me settle on that decision. I'm sure my little guy will be fine. He's a happy, active, rambunctious kid otherwise. Loves to cuddle (on his terms), loves his sister, loves being outside or watching his favorite cartoons.

parenting,1gn8fl0,My son flashed a group of kids ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gn8fl0/my_son_flashed_a_group_of_kids/,1,"Around a friend's house for a bonfire gathering with my wife and three kids (10yo boy, 9yo girl and 1yo baby) and having a lovely evening when my friend comes in and has a quiet word with me. His daughter's (12 and 10) have just told him that my son has flashed his privates at them and the other kids (8-12 yos). 

I was shocked - has never done anything like that before and a typical ""good boy"" all his school reports are glowing about his behaviour, he can be daft/forgetful but he is also smart and thoughtful, increasingly pre-teenish and is getting a bit ""woe is me""ish but whenever I spend time with other boys his age I am reminded hes a good kid. 

I pull him out of the room the kids are in and ask him what happened. He's starts minimising it saying it was only for a second and generally being irritated that I'm talking to him about it although also clearly in a kinda of hyper/over-excited state (at this point it's taking all my self control not to completely lose it with him). I explain how serious it is - that it's also called indecent exposure and a crime that can get jail time (UK and though a ten yo ain't getting a jail sentence for it he is now above the age of criminal responsibility in this country). I ask him why he did it and he just keeps saying he doesn't know. I tell him to wait there whilst I speak to mum. 

Mum comes and speaks to him the two of him. Her debrief is that he's mortified with embarrasment. That another kid did 'pantsing' at school and he didn't mean to pull down his underwear just show his pants. He's also cross with me (f knows why). I'm sceptical as he didn't say any of this to me and feel like he's used the time to come up with a more sympathetic story ie can believe he's seen another kid do it but if he didn't mean to do it that feels like something he would have said from the off. Can also believe he is now embarrassed having to speak to me and mum about it but those were not the vibes I was getting from him.

Spoke to my friend with him about it. He's a vicar and had a chat with my son - not sure what was said but seemed reasonably chill and supportive of him. We explained to his daughters that he is embarrassed and they appear to accept this. Everyone moves on with the evening (easily done with a baby to keep us busy) which is again lovely. For more typically daft reasons he loses his shoes and I give him a ""piggy back home"". I speak to mum about it when they're in bed - wouldn't say we're on the same page about it but agree its now been dealt with and move on.

The next morning (today) mum posts on a group chat saying sorry about the (aubergine emoji). Which irritates me as feel a bit minimising and not everyone was aware of what happened so also start to think about influence on other young lads who saw it and maybe didn't get looped into the aftermath as well as what the others really think about it all. Getting son ready for football, realise he's only eaten a bit of chocolate for breakfast - porridge has been made so ask him to eat that at which point he starts giving me back chat and casting himself as a victim (more typical and winds me up enormously). I'm cross - bring it up again saying he should be thanking his lucky stars how little consequence there was for him yesterday not starting to give out about it all and now I'm the bad guy with both him and mum.

I've previously worked with rape victims and offenders and know a lot about the impact of flashing on women as a form of sexual violence and as an early warning sign of more serious stuff that can follow for the (mainly) men. Which also makes me think as that's really my only experience of it all maybe I am overreacting... Then I think what my dad/grandad/great grandad would have dealt with him and think we've been so flipping modern and understanding that maybe the whole world has gone mad and I should just be at minimum banning him from his consoles or giving him a month of chores or whatever (certainly older gens referenced would have been with a helping of 'phyisical punishment' although probably more motiivated by their embarrassment in front of friends than care about the kids).

Googled and all the advice is what to do if you or your child has been flashed and nothing I can see when you are the parent. Some sense of whether I'm being the jerk or  suggestions re what would be sensible to do next gratefully received.",2024-11-09 11:50:32

So, time for a talk with my 8yr old daughter (ADHD/ODD; currently in Special Ed with an established IEP) about it. My first instinct is to tell her that if some boy says that to her, that she has full permission to knock his jaw off. However, she also struggles with aggressive outbursts when she gets disregulated, and I don't want to unintentionally add fuel to that fire. 

I've raised her to understand that her body is 100% HERS, and no one has the right to touch her in any way she doesn't want (with very few exceptions, I.e. Doctor visit with me present). I've also told her to never say something that she doesn't 100% understand, because words have meaning and those meanings have consequences. I know if *I* ever hear some stupid male tell someone that in my presence, I will go off on him, stranger or not. I'm normally a very sweet, peaceful person, but this is one of my hard lines that I will not tolerate.

So... thoughts? How do I help her maintain her bodily autonomy correctly, without possibly adding trouble to her regulation issues?

Edit: Also note that the way they do SpEd at her school is all in one classroom, so she's not around only 3rd graders. I know there's at least one 5th grader in there that has said some sketchy things to her before.


Edit #2: I will clarify that her aggression is directly related to a low frustration tolerance and a strong sense of self (as in she wants to do things HER way). If she starts yelling/flailing/whatever, it's because she's been told to do something by an authority figure that she doesn't agree with.

I hugged her and told her I love her no matter what, and that she’s still the same amazing person she’s always been. But my husband (her dad) had a very different reaction.

He didn’t yell or get aggressive, but he just went completely silent. He barely said anything, and you could feel the tension in the room. Since then, he’s been distant with her. He hasn’t made any openly negative comments, but he’s acting colder – not joking around with her like he used to or even really engaging in conversation. My daughter noticed, of course, and she asked me if he’s angry at her. I did my best to reassure her that he’s just processing, but honestly, I don’t know if that’s true.

My husband and I have talked privately about it, and he says he “needs time to adjust” and that he’s worried about what this “means for her future.” I tried to explain that what she needs right now is our support, not judgment, but he keeps saying he just doesn’t understand and that he’s having a hard time. It’s been hard for me too, trying to keep the peace while also making sure my daughter feels loved and accepted.

I’m worried about the damage this is doing to her and their relationship. She’s such a bright, loving kid, and I can see how much his distance is hurting her. I don’t want her to feel like there’s something wrong with her or that her dad’s love is conditional.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you help your partner come around while still prioritizing your child’s well-being? I’m really struggling to balance it all, and I don’t want to let her down. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.",2024-11-09 05:41:50
parenting,1gn6cia,Another Child,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gn6cia/another_child/,1,"Hi everyone
I kinda confused about a situation im currently dealing with which is the topic of having another child.
We had our only child when i was 30 and ever since my life is completely different and hard.
I can’t even explain how i love my son he is so precious to me, extremely smart and funny, beautiful and joyful, but he is also so hard to deal with from my side.
I discovered that I wasn’t build to be a father, i like my freedom, i like to leave/come home whenever i want, but having a kid restrict that.
My son is extremely active and stubborn, so hard to get him sleep, lately if he doesn’t get what he wants he screams nonstop and I can’t stand this tbh.
Also we try to put him to sleep so she can go out to do some activities but this mission is kinda impossible.
Besides all that the topic of having another child is always on the table, I always refuse to go through this experience again and she wants so bad.
I feel that I really think one child ( almost 2 ) is so enough for me and she always tells me that im being so selfish to let him grow up alone.
I really feel bad about it but i also really don’t want another child because the divorce topic always comes to the table from me ( not because I don’t love her or something but i just can’t handle screaming and me being not free to do whatever i want whenever i want)
She always tells me that first child is always like this but the second one might be different which I always disagree because who knows ?
I really feel so confused about my situation.
Please be respectful in the replies..",2024-11-09 09:19:27

We're talking to a therapist to help us handle him since he's apparently a ""strong willed child"" and she says that this is Gen alpha epidemic. That these kids are living in a hyper sexualized world, and are picking this crap up and then it gets spread in school.  A few family friends with kids same age or other people in just random kids conversation are saying the same thing.  We live in a major metropolitan city if that makes a difference.

At home he has Internet access on lock down, only school sites, no YT and filters in place on devices. Never left alone in his room to get on any tech.  We have a family laptop that is used for school and he will use wife's phone locked with kid settings to play games.  All this to say that he can't be watching porn or music videos or whatever might sneak into his eyeballs via YT.

My other concern are the possible handful of kids that have phones on school and maybe they watch stuff during recess or whenever they have whatever available time to sneak a screen in. 

I guess the question is, are kids doing this stuff now?  How do you handle it?  We're being told to ignore it since we usually just tell to please stop doing x since it drives us crazy watching him do the noises or movements.

Recently, I even found items missing that we’ve kept safe for years.

What's even scarier is that I suspect there might be a drug influence involved. He’s hanging out with new friends I don’t recognize, and his behavior has taken a complete turn. It’s like I’m losing him to something dark, and I don’t know how to reach him. 

We’ve tried therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping, and I fear he’s dragging his younger brother down the same path.

Our neighbors have noticed his behavior too, and it's getting harder to keep things under control. I'm worried about how this might affect our family reputation, but more than anything, I’m terrified for his future.

We have a 5.5 year old boy together. I have been trying my best to take care him.  He's a really sweet kid, but he was just diagnosed with ASD and ADHD with combined presentation. 

From the early days, he has been a difficult kid. We tried our best to raise him and not giving up to his consistent tantrums and provide him support. Deep down, I always wonder if it was because of our parenting or other reasons, why he is so different. Suddenly, with his confirmed diagnosis, everything explains. 

At first, I feel really relieved that it was not my parenting, and I finally know what is the right way to support and guide him. But as this diagnosis gradually sinks in, I found myself started crying again. I don't see an exist path. It is a lifelong issue and he will always be struggling with simple things that other kids do so easily. Everyday, I provided consistent reminders to eat, to get dressed, to wash hands, do not play during dinner time, please do your homework, please come over to take a bath and I am waiting. Please do not consistently moving when I am brushing your teeth. 

He melts down if we go to doctors' appts and arrives at school at a different time. He melts down if I have him a sweater that he feels the color is not alright. He screams if his demand is not met on daily basis. He used to hit me and my parents when angry and thank God, he stops doing that recently. 

The other day, he was lying besides me, and out of nowhere, probably due to boredom, he screams into my ear. My ear hurt so much. Today, he was not happy and screamed again. Even though it was not to my ear, my ear still hurts a lot. I am not sure how long it will take to recover.

I am not sure how long I can last like this, stay positive. For now, I feel I am really down and just so tired, and helpless. ",2024-11-09 00:16:16

I have a 19m old who is very attached to me, doesn’t sleep throughout the night and needs lots of stimulation throughout the day. I am also 6 months pregnant. 

My toddler is currently in a local daycare, (rated ofsted good), 3 days a week which he really likes. The staff are nice but I’m a teacher and sometimes think their activities can be a little beige / repetitive and their outdoor area is very limited (it’s in a small, converted car park). He does go happily though so we’re lucky in that respect. 

I’ve recently been messaging an ex member of staff and I asked her honest opinion of whether it’s the right fit for my kid and she basically said it’s a shit show and she wouldn’t recommend it to her own family. She hasn’t elaborated on this point despite me asking to meet with her - kind of annoying! 

Anyway, my toddler had a place lined up at an outstanding nursery which has a much better outdoor facility, forest school etc. the staff seemed lovely when I had the tour and my kid enjoyed looking around the many Montessori activities etc. The waitlist was 2.5 years long. 

A place has become available for him from end of Jan and baby is due towards the end of Feb. We also move back into a newly renovated house in 2 weeks. 

I’m concerned about the many changes my little one is about to face. As an already rubbish sleeper and one tired, pregnant mama, I’m so confused with what to do. In the long run, the new nursery is a much better fit for him but am I making things potentially x10 worse, just before the arrival of a newborn??

This for me was frustrating because I was losing valuable evening time with my partner. She started grade 4 in September and there was an immediate almost overnight change where she suddenly HAD to be in bed by 8pm. Like running to get to bed type of urgency. 
I will also say that she is a kid that is obsessed with TV. Yet on the weekend, she can’t finish a movie because “oh no it’s 8:30pm” on a Friday or Saturday with absolutely no other commitments the following day. It’s utterly bewildering to me. This is someone who was so resistant to going to bed. Never wanted to miss out on anything we were doing. Always made excuses to linger. Would get to bed later than me, a working adult. This change happened almost overnight. Like in the time that it took me to give birth to her sister she had suddenly adopted this urgent almost neurotic obsession with getting to bed. I know I ought to be grateful because I internally complained about her staying up late for years. But I can’t help but feel like there’s something wrong with this? It’s almost as if it’s driven by fear but she refuses to explain any further other than “I don’t like to go to bed late” which is utter BS by the way, and “I’m tired”. 

Anyone else experience anything like this?? 
Is it some form of ADHD or OCD or what? I do believe she has tics. She’s never been diagnosed with anything but there’s been certain repetitive behaviours that are not normal. (Tugging on pony tail, coughing, picking wedgie, throat clearing, and much to our dismay: frequent urination). I wonder if this could be another tic?

Im not even sure what im asking.

My youngest son is 13, im a single mom 35- father not in the picture.

I know teenage years are turbulent times for a boy. I want to sort of handle it correctly and support him right without f-ing it up, giving him bad habits or making him feel he has to run away or hurt his self esteem or feel unsupported etc

My mother was abusive when i was a child and going from relationship to relationship (with some very bad men). When she finally settled they kicked me out when i was 11- i went from home to home, then to an abusive foster home (they got alot of money to keep me), then to one abusive relationship then to one last abusive relationship which ended 9 years ago. 

Its safe to say i dont really have positive role models that did parenting well- only the ideals created in movies (but that was an unrealistic expectation that therapy helped to breakthrough)

I have been single ever since, done alot of therapy growing healing and reparenting my own inner child. Ive also gone back to school, got diplomas, worked hard and am building good network of people of professionals to boost and support my career. I feel im about 15 years behind in life though, from all those years just trying to survive instead of experiencing life. But anyway.

Raising my son has been mostly delightful, even though there were times i was hardly surviving. Being young with no money or support was hard. 
But i made it work. I love being his mom. He is a fantastic, loving, cuddly kid and watching him grow safely and thriving and experiencing life has been so special. 

But now he is a teenager- its like learning how to be a parent all over again but harder. And i dont know what im doing. He has hormones, is taller than me and is good at expressing what he’s thinking, wanting and feeling- good and bad lol.

He is going out with his friends more, a little smelly, fashion conscious, eats everything and its like a little hurricane of clothes, socks, hair products and food wrappers. But he is also dealing with peer pressure, stress, grades, looks, girls, etc etc. He still looks to me for advice and cuddles and wants to spend time with me but i fear that wont last long as teenage years come into full force.

 I dont even know what will happen- i only have my own horrible experience as a teen as perspective.

I think im just looking for some kinds words, some direction and an adult haha.

Thanks for reading.

She feels that the depression is her identity and she does not want to get better because she would ""lose herself"". She also described what sounded like dissociation, saying she doesnt feel real sometimes and she doesnt think she has a personality because she takes on personalities of whoever she's talking to. After all that, she talked about things she's interested and showed me an art project she's proud of. And then told me not to think we had a bonding moment...

My (29M) wife (29F) and I were at our wits’ end trying to get any meaningful period of sleep at night or accomplish anything during the day because our baby would not nap. She used to at least sleep for 5-6 hours at a time at night but that had stopped in the last few weeks. 

A little over a week ago, we implemented the Ferber (graduated extinction) method at the recommendation of our pediatrician.  She’s now getting herself to sleep within 5 minutes of being out down after about 8 days of this, and will sleep 9-10 hours at a time at night. Typically she wakes up once after that time to feed, and then will go back down for an additional 1.5-2 hours, after which she wakes up for the day. Her naps run about an hour long, give or take a few minutes.

The first couple of nights were very hard, as the crying was very hard to listen to, especially for her mom. We stuck with it though and she’s getting and staying asleep like a champ now. If you’re on the fence about Ferber and can safely implement it in your home, I strongly, strongly recommend it, based on our experience. ",2024-11-09 12:30:43

It's breaking us, to the point where I'm going to have to stop driving to work as I've so nearly fallen asleep at the wheel. My main issue is he can't be getting enough sleep and how this is effecting his learning at school and just his general happiness. He's super emotional at the moment.

I've read about child anxiety and it links with starting school. We're trying to help, but nothing is stopping these night wakings. His sleep hygiene is good. We have the same bedtime routine, he doesn't watch tv through the school days etc. 

I'm hoping for some advice or pointing in the right direction. Any help is really appreciated. ",2024-11-09 02:20:08
parenting,1gmzqlq,Please help... overtired baby,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmzqlq/please_help_overtired_baby/,5,"Lately my husband and I have been finding ourselves with a very overtired baby that screams when it comes to going to sleep. Whether it is a nap or bedtime, he is full-blown screaming and sobbing. He is inconsolable, and shushing, rocking, nor a pacifier are helping. He eventually just goes unconscious, but this is after over an hour of my husband and I taking turns trying to get him to bed. He will sleep great in my arms, but we put him down, he wakes up within 10-15 minutes screaming and we start the cycle all over again. He is 2 months old, so we are no longer able to swaddle (he hated it anyways), but he startles himself awake with his arms out. I have been having to bed-share with him because it is the only way either of us get any sleep, but I'm not sleeping great and the sleep deprivation is eating me alive.

parenting,1gmzikv,Daycare workers ignored me/ didn't notice us when I brought my son into daycare,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmzikv/daycare_workers_ignored_me_didnt_notice_us_when_i/,14,"This has happened a couple of times. The first time was when I brought my son into daycare and there were 3 workers in there but in that moment I only saw 2. I know that the first 2 saw me cause they made eye contact with me. But instead of saying ""Hi"" to me or my son they just stared at me at the same time and said nothing. They were staring at me for a while and the entire time they just stayed silent while they stared at me. They didn't respond when I finished speaking either. They just kept staring at me and said nothing. It was so awkward. As soon as I opened the door I told them my son has some stuff in his bag and they didn't even respond. 

They just stared at me in silence and both looked upset to see me. Then the 3rd teacher that I didn't see at first finally noticed us and greeted us. While this was happening the director of the daycare was in the kitchen in another room across from my son's class room and within earshot. 

When I called her and spoke to her about what happened she said ""I heard the conversation"" (I don't think she was paying attention though and she didn't SEE how the other two workers reacted to me before the 3rd worker finally acknowledged me). I asked her if the workers were mad at me and she tried to reassure me and said ""No. Nobody is mad at you."" 

Then the next day when I took my son to daycare I opened the door and saw one of the workers. I didn't remember her name so I called her ""teacher"" instead when I tried to get her attention. She didn't even look at me. She was looking at her phone the entire time that I kept saying ""Teacher"" over and over. The other kids there were staring at me while I was trying to get the teachers attention to let her know that my son is there. Then I walked back to the office (since the teacher was still ignoring me) and told the MAIN director ""I don't think the teacher heard me."" And then she (the MAIN director) didn't look at me either and was also looking at her own phone too. Then her coworker the ASSISTANT director followed me back to the classroom and before she even said anything the teacher was already in the hallway acting as if she was waiting for me (no she wasn't. She was ignoring me before that.) it made me wonder if she really was ignoring me or if she just didn't hear me and if one of the other kids tried to tell her that I was trying to say something. Either that or she overheard me talking to the director and didn't wanna get in trouble. 

So my question is, why are they not acknowledging me? This was not an issue the first couple weeks that we started daycare. Why is it an issue now? The whole reason I try to speak to the teacher each time I take my son to daycare is so that they notice when he is there.

Today when I picked him up from daycare there was a different worker there. She said ""He was good. He didn't cry today."" I asked her if he cried yesterday and she said ""A little bit."" My son is 14 months old. You'd think a daycare worker would know that it's normal for them to cry at that age but I'm not sure what she was implying honestly. 

Another thing I noticed is that before I started my new job my son was happy when I picked him up from daycare. After I started my new job he sometimes cries or whines (not heavy crying but just slightly crying) when I pick him up from daycare. I don't know if he just senses something is different because of my job or if it's just a coincidence. 

Also for context my son is 14 months old and this is the first daycare he has ever been to. 

The daycare workers seemed nice to me the first couple of weeks that my son was there but lately I've noticed a huge change in their attitudes. I'm not sure if they dislike me or if they dislike my son or if they dislike both of us. 

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or reading too much into it or not. It would be rude if I just took him into the classroom and left without saying anything. It doesn't have to be a full conversation. I just wanna make sure they know when he is there.

parenting,1glx9nu,17-year-old is making our lives a nightmare!,467,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1glx9nu/17yearold_is_making_our_lives_a_nightmare/,245,"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be posting something like this. My 17-year-old son has turned into an absolute nightmare. I know, I know -- teenagers are hard. But this situation is so much more than teenage hormones. I apologize in advance for how long this will be. 

Since he was about 15, my son has had a temper, absolutely flying off the handle for the most minor things. We've never acted as though they were minor, though. We've tried to talk to him about it (typically after everything simmered down) and have offered him help. He refuses. 

Then, there was an incident when he was 15. He smoked pot with friends, came home high, then had a panic attack and told us what was going on. While there were some restrictions imposed, his dad and I let him off pretty easily, with us even telling him about our own experiences with anxiety/panic attacks and pot when we were younger. 

After this incident, my son agreed to do a telehealth visit with a psychiatrist. I told him he could do it alone, or I could be there. He requested that I be there. The psychiatrist determined that he likely has ODD and there's a chance that he has ADHD. After the call, my son denied everything, said it wasn't true and since then, has refused to visit a psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist. 

Fast forward to when he turned 17 (or a little before then). He flips out at least two to three times a week. And I'm not talking the teenage ""I hate you"" followed by a slamming door. I am talking giant holes punched in our wall, his door ripped off the hinges, and items in our yard being destroyed. That isn't as bad as the verbal abuse. He insults everything from my weight to my job, calling me a ""fat a\_\_ b\_\_\_\_"" and oinking in my face. I ask him something simple, such as ""Would you bring down your laundry, please?"" and he starts insulting me, calling me autistic, the r-word, and says I have down syndrome. He frequently calls me stupid. He tells me I am a horrible mother, the worst in the world, and he wishes I would die. It is very hard to deal with. 

I will note here that I am not a perfect parent, but I have always tried my hardest. I work from home and have always picked up/dropped off my kids or been at home when they get off the bus. I listen to them, and if they're going through something difficult, I tell them I can set them up an appointment to talk to a professional to work through it (if they don't want to talk to me). I've been to every school performance, awards day, sports practice, game, and other activity. Our family spends lots of time together, we eat together every night (unless one of the kids is off with friends), we go to dinners, movies, activites, vacations. We make every birthday special, every Christmas magical. We give our children their privacy, we don't pry too much, we take interest in their friends/hobbies/activities. We are very supportive. I don't know where things went so wrong. 

Last year, he was skipping school and truancy was about to get involved. He expressed he didn't like his school, so I enrolled him in a very relaxed, lenient virtual school option. He took some interest at first, but quickly lost interest, skipping live class sessions (he only had a few each week -- a couple hours, tops, every week), missing assignments, etc. When I saw how far behind he was, I had a discussion with him. Everything seemed okay, and he was back on track. While it was questionable if he was going to graduate from his B&M school, he was actually on track to early graduation through this new program. 

This year, he started senior year. There have been multiple blow-ups, but his dad and I just try to get through it. School year started off the same way -- he was doing okay and then he wasn't. One night, about a month ago, he went to hang out with friends. At about 10 PM on a school night, he texted me and asked if he could spend the night with his friend. I told him, no, his dad needed the car and he had school the next day. He came in about 5 minutes later in an absolute rampage and told us he would be dropping out of school. 

  
Since that time, the blowups have been worse. They happen at least twice a week, sometimes daily. I am verbally assaulted by him for asking simple questions...can you bring down dirty dishes from your room? Did you walk your dog? And today, I got the news from his school -- he has been officially withdrawn and can not come back. He was set to graduate next month. 

At this point, he is no longer in school. He does not have a job. He has not cleaned his room in over a year. He does not contribute to the house. He is VERY verbally abusive to me, a little bit to his dad, and pretty bad with our teenage daughter. He has been completely destructive to our home.

He still refuses therapy or seeing a doctor and is completely delusional about arguments and what he does (we have security cameras that have caught him breaking items outside, and he denies it). My husband, daughter, and I talk to him about what happens and he insists we are lying or that I've ""brainwashed"" them. He accuses me of being a liar when I tell my husband things that happened when he wasn't home. When I give him the opportunity to tell ""the truth,"" he has nothing to say. He will resort to calling me a liar and deragatory names. 

A few months ago, we had a sitdown. I told him that I knew how bad the economy was and how expensive rent, groceries, EVERYTHING is, and that when he turns 18 and graduates, he was welcome to live here, provided he was going to college and/or working a job. I didn't want to be that parent that just showed my kid the door at 18. 

But now (and I know how horrible this sounds) I am counting down the days until he turns 18, so we can legally ask him to leave our home. I absolutely hate the thought of it -- especially with no education, only a few months of job experience, and no idea of what he's going to face in the real world. However, I can no longer feel like a prisoner in my home. I can no longer go into my car or bedroom to cry because my son is so terribly abusive to me, it rocks me to my core. 

My question is...has anyone else dealt with this? Again, this is far more than just typical hormonal teenager. It is honestly like one of those old daytime TV shows with ""wild teens"" only he is amplified by 1,000. I do not like the person that he has become. I will always, always love him, but I just can't do this anymore. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. I do not want to put him out -- I know how hard the world is right now. But at this point, I don't see any other choice.

She’s talented, bright and beautiful - she has the world at her feet. She plays sports (and is involved with that 3-4 times per week), so she does have an outlet, which also keeps her fit and healthy. 

She started a new school this year, and while she’s friendly with people there and is not having any issues, overall she finds some of the other girls a little superficial, and so has no desire to forge any deeper friendships. 

She has 5-6 really good friends between childhood and through her sports, but she never organises to meet up with them, or has them over all that often, but she loves and appreciates them, and chats with them often. She also has a great relationship with her dad and brother, as well as myself - we’re a close knit family and spend lots of time together. 

She’s a real homebird, and loves nothing more than getting into her PJs after school (unless she has training that evening) and watching a series or movie. She also loves doing arts and crafts, and she can turn her hand to anything. She gets great joy from this.

A lot of her peers drink at the weekends, and also vape. But she has no interest in this lifestyle. I’m proud and anxious about it in equal measures. I’m concerned that she has no interest in socialising with her peers (or even organising nights out with her own friends), but also proud that she’s not trying to conform.

Sorry this is long but I’m hoping for advice. We have a generally super happy 7 month old who can be a little bit of a Velcro baby. He can get fussy if you’re not holding him/not holding him in the way he wants. He definitely has big feelings and will scream and sob if he’s not getting what he needs. He also is in a stage where he is shrieking, blowing spit bubbles, fake coughing, just generally loud. While this is all super normal (imo), we are human so obviously there are moments where it can be overstimulating/annoying. 

I’d like to start with my husband is involved, proactive, a fantastic partner and human who loves our family deeply. But we have super different ways of handling baby stress and it’s causing issues. In moments where baby is screaming and I’m feeling overwhelmed, I’m looking to promptly resolve whatever is making him fuss/scream. It’s partially because I want the baby to feel soothed, but also selfishly, so that he stops lol. My husband is much more inclined to let him scream, even when the resolution is right there (stand up, give him a hug, bounce him). He OFTEN (at least 1+ times a day) is telling the baby to “shut up”, “shut the fuck up”, telling him no/stop in a stern voice. He’s done this since the baby was born—it shocked me initially because he’s generally a very gentle person. He says it’s his way of coping, which I TOTALLY get, but I really feel baby doesn’t deserve to be spoken to that way. I get occasionally, but every day, often multiple times feels like a recipe for a child who needs to walk on eggshells when expressing themselves. Beyond that, I think my husband underestimates how much his reactions escalate baby’s behavior further. Baby hears his tone and will cry louder, fuss more—my husband doesn’t see he’s contributing. I would be more ok with a “shut up” in a singsong-y voice once in a while, but I feel strongly that tone matters. 

He’ll also scold the baby and firmly tell him no for doing things like blowing spit bubbles or scratching at his shirt when he’s holding him, and defend that we need to teach him not to do certain things. I really think that most of these kinds of behaviors are not only normal, but GOOD for his development. I also don’t think he has the proper brain function at 7 months to really understand discipline. We pretty fundamentally disagree on this. 

We’ve tried to discuss these topics truly, hundreds of times. It always seems like I come across like I’m lecturing or holier than thou. I really do get why my husband gets frustrated, I do too, I’m not perfect, I just need him control his reactions more often. I know that’s not a simple task, but I don’t want my baby’s first sentence to be “shut the fuck up” lol. Am I overreacting here?

I am heart broken. 

It's awesome. 

It's amazing. 

She's a fabulous reader. I bought her the chapter books. I was thrilled to present her with the continuation of her favourite set of books, and she was stoked to get them. We are on holiday. It's been a long day. Her little sister fell asleep, so storybooks aren't necessary tonight. 

She looked at me and said, ""it's okay mum, I've got this.""

My heart broke. Our snuggle time, where I read three stories or some chapters is gone. She's cool to read to herself. It's natural and such a normal progression. And I have stuff to do. But this has been my habit for almost a decade. Reading to my kids at night is what I have done EVERY SINGLE NIGHT for 8 years. It's a huge part of who I am.

then my kids left that school at the start of the year and don't really care about being friends with them anymore.

The other kids have grown to be kind of bossy and loud, and they've made one of my kids cry multiple times just by being kind of mean or rejecting him, even though they used to be friends at school.

But I'm friends with their mum, and they keep asking for playdates. Sometimes it's at their house, sometimes it's at mine, but none of my kids really want to and it's hurting my middle child because he always ends up upset when they are over.

I have fond memories of the sleepovers I had as a child. I wanted my child to share some of the same experiences, I guess. 

* 1st sleepover at 8, girl left at 10 pm because she ""just wanted to go home.""
* 2nd sleepover at 9, girl got picked up in the middle of the night because she was ""hungry."" This was after she punched my 4 y/o in the face and I told her not to do that again.
* 3rd sleepover at 9, this girl was very mature and wonderful with the younger children. She is polite, smart, can talk to an adult and gladly helps out and cleans up after herself. She's far superior then most kids her age, but she was the youngest of 4. Fight ensued at around 10:30 pm (I knew I shouldn't have let them stay up to watch a movie in the living room because it ends up waking up the littles) anyway, they got into a fight about a blanket (of zero significance to my daughter) and I told my daughter that the guest gets first choice. My kid pouted in the laundry room and her friend even apologized and my daughter refused to accept the apology. I explained to her that she should, it is just a blanket after all, and she still refused. They were fine in the morning and she still comes over to play.
* 4th sleepover at just turned 10, with same girl from 2nd & 3rd sleepover) I'm 2 hours in and overstimulated and had to ask the kids just to stay put in their room. Her mom sent her with a tablet, they both have ADHD, and as far as I am concerned, they can just sit in the room for the rest of the night. They ate pizza and I let them play outside for a while (which clearly did nothing for them because they drug their bikes out there and were back within 5 minutes). Since I have watched it happen in the past with the kids going in-and-out which drives me freaking nuts, why? Because it's harder for me to keep an eye on the littles. So I said, ""Playroom, Your Room or Outside! Pick!"" I did raise my voice. 

I acknowledge I am a control freak, but I pretty much have to be as a full-time working professional woman with 4 children. I'm working on letting go and lightening up, but I still have boundaries.

If you allow sleepovers, how often? What rules do you have? How do you tolerate the overstimulation? How do you enforce rules with other people's kids and appropriately with your own in front of the other child without embarrassing them? I always want to be nice and provide opportunities to socialize for my child, but I think I am too lenient and it's too much of a free-for-all. I've been sick recently, and also wonder why nobody ever volunteers to have my child over? Seems like I'm always the host. 

Venting, but also looking for insight. I am an only child, and so I just never had this horrid level of stimulation. It was just my dad and I. I don't know what is normal.",2024-11-09 01:22:18

- moved straps up so they weren’t pulling her shoulders down
- a car nightlight that changes colors
- stuffies to snuggle 
- someone sitting in the back with her & not having anyone in the back

parenting,1gmwvv4,Relatives interfering with parenting my toddler,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmwvv4/relatives_interfering_with_parenting_my_toddler/,1,"

Hello everyone,

I have a bit of an issue that is causing me some stress. I’m a FTM to a toddler and I live with my husband and in laws - including my BIL, his wife and their kid who is 1. 

My husband and I are definitely not perfect parents but we do our absolute best to parent our child when he does something he should not be doing like hitting or throwing toys, kicking, pushing others etc. He has quite the personality and is a typical boy - bounces off the walls, tantrums every now and then, screaming NO, you get the picture. 

While it’s difficult to manage this as first time parents of a three year old, we make it a point to deal with him with as much care and love as possible. This means responding to him with kindness and very minimal yelling (we do slip from time to time but it is rare). Even with his tantrums we do our utmost best to respond to him with calmness to teach him the same and simultaneously it is definitely triggering us but we are also learning to rewire our own brains in the process.

While we are dealing with this, it’s incredibly frustrating when someone other than me or my husband gets involved when he does something wrong - for example, he can be a bit rough when it comes to playing and sometimes while he’s running around, he’ll either accidentally (or sometimes purposefully) knock my BIL’s kid over (they are also FT parents too so you can imagine that they kind of freak out whenever this happens) but he has rarely hurt him so badly that he wa seriously injured or crying hysterically - it’s just the casual nudge or slight push and he falls down. As soon as this happens, my SIL is always first to respond “no don’t push that’s not nice.” Fine, I understand how she feels, but then it happens again and she responds the same way - her son was eating something in his high chair and my kid goes up to him and takes the food from him and eats it himself. She starts saying “so-so is eating right now, don’t snatch food from him that’s not nice.” 

Another time her son came up to my kid with a toy in his hand and tried to give it to him and my son nudged him away - she saw this and said “so-so is just trying to share with you that’s not nice” 

And again the same thing happened just now, my son was sitting on a chair and their son came up to him and my kid nudged him with his foot and he fell down (he was completely fine) and again she said “no pushing that’s not nice” to which I had enough and responded “maybe try to positively reinforce him because he is learning and makes mistakes but it doesn’t help when we talk negatively with him as it affects him.” She just got defensive and started saying “I didn’t even say anything in a negative way” and I just told her “ I’m just saying this because it’s been happening a lot lately, and talking negatively to a kid will affect them.”

While this is all being said I’m severely triggered because what she is saying has some negative undertones and there are some fundamental things she is not understanding:

1. Kids will be kids, they do these things
2. Kids at this age are still learning, they have impulses and act on them - just because as adults we wouldn’t do that doesn’t mean we should treat a toddler the same way- they have developing brains and can’t understand this concept 
3. Consistently speaking like this to a kid doesn’t help them learn - you need to show them these things (and this is where me and my husband try to do our part)
But it all just irks me when someone parents my child and in a way that my husband and I don’t agree with it. The hardest part is that they live with us and it’s a daily struggle - I can’t leave my kid alone while they’re son is around cause he’ll end up playing rough (he thinks all kids are his age and can play the same way) and others don’t seem to get that. There have been times where even my BIL has snapped at him and it has made me super angry. My husband agrees that this is definitely not the right approach and mentioned he would politely correct them next time - but I guess I went ahead and did it myself cause I’m done with it.

Any suggestions or advice with how to deal with it?

It feels like the 5 year old has written me off as just a person and not even remotely an adult figure let alone his dad. The meltdowns are constant , one every few hours that go on for ages with toys being thrown and punching , kicking , biting , spitting. Multiple occasions I’m the main target for the aggression as with everyone else he tends to have “easy calm downs”. If I’m trying to calm him down I use everything in the book to try and ease the situation but he will always turn physical and at some point I loose control and either snap back wifh a tone or try to physically block his hits. This has now led to him running away to someone else screaming that I’m hurting him and i always hurt him. 

I don’t want to hurt him , I hate loosing my cool but now I’m being shown as an abusive parent and I don’t know what to do . I try so hard to do everything anyone tells me to try but it always ends up with me being covered in scratches and teeth marks . 

To make it worse his mother comes from an abusive household and is now implying that she will cut contact with me and move the kids away if I don’t “improve” .

My MIL was over last weekend. Me (30F) and my partner (35F) were working with her in our son's (14mo) room. We were all in there trying to figure out a better way to organize his things. After awhile, LO became pretty fussy, and wasn't really interested in playing by himself anymore while the grown-ups worked on things. 


So he's making a lot of noise and crying, trying to get us to stop what we are doing and tend to him. We tried to encourage him to play just a bit longer, but he wasn't having it. So I'm about to pick him up and comfort him, and MIL looks at LO, rolls her eyes and says, ""Oh, please... you aren't dying."" And starts laughing. My wife chuckles a bit too. I don't really see what is funny about a dysregulated toddler, so i didn't laugh.


I said, ""it isn't nice to laugh at him when he is distressed."" My MIL basically implied that he had no idea that they were laughing at him, that he was 'too young' to understand that. My wife also chimes in, and says, ""sometimes, it's okay for people to laugh at you. It builds resilience.""


Which, like... on its face, I don't disagree. But it also just seems needlessly mean? Especially to someone so young. Idk, it didn't sit right with me. I should mention that I am neurodivergent, and I have a condition that makes me hyper-empathetic and pretty sensitive to teasing. I tend to pick up emotional cues very quickly,  and I really try to be cognizant of and honor other people's feelings.


I talked to my therapist about this, and he said that he thinks the answer lies somewhere in between what I think and what my wife/MIL think. But honestly, I don't know what that would look like. I just know that kids are perceptive, even when they are as young as my LO. I want to be a safe place for him, because he'll have plenty of opportunities to build resilience when he comes face-to-face with emotional challenges out in the 'real world.' 


I want to be predictable and validating, but I also don't want to coddled or shelter him necessarily.


I'm just a bit stumped, and wanted to see what others had to say on the subject. Thanks in advance.",2024-11-08 19:33:52

It's not only when she's being told no by me, but if her sister does something she doesn't like, if something happens that she doesn't want to have happen, if an inanimate object does something like tip over that she didn't want to tip over. Her immediate response is to throw her head up and scream-cry about it. Sometimes she drops to the floor. 🤦🏽‍♀️ The school tells me she doesn't do this. I don't think she's done it in response to her dad or maybe even in front of him. We may hear her scream-cry from another room, but not directly in front of him. She doesn't do it in front of other family members either or strangers. So I know she's capable of controlling herself when she wants to.
I just don't know what to do. First of all, it's super annoying. I don't give into her demands, in fact I tell her that having that response is going to make me want to do the opposite, that she's not going to get what she wants. She knows what a Karen is, she watches youtube. When I told her she's going to become a Karen if she keeps acting like this, it's not something she wants. She doesn't want to be a brat, or so she says. I've tried talking to her about ways to manage her emotions a million times, I even wrote a short book for her to refer to (I'm not an author,  but heck, she was five and wasn't much of a critic! 😂). She has been a dramatic child her entire life. I could have predicted this outcome when, at the age of one, if things weren't going her way she would ""cry"" and run behind our couch. 
I've gotten to the point of just saying ""stop""or even threatening that if she doesn't stop she will lose tablet time. And, she is able to stop! 
That's what I don't get. If she's able to stop, how do I get her to not do it in the first place? I will try anything. Or maybe this is just a phase we have to go through? I don't know! Do I need to just start ignoring her completely? Do I need to put her on time out every time she does this? Does anybody who has gone through this have some advice? I am all ears!

We were so worried we figured it was time transition from the crib to a toddler bed. We engaged him the process of change, made it fun and let him choose his sheets. He seemed excited. However, since then his sleeping has been a disaster (We sleep trained him at 3 months and he had built good sleeping habits of falling asleep on his own at bedtime and putting himself back to sleep in the night.).  
Since the transition we've resorted to laying next to him at nights to fall asleep, and now if he wakes up in the middle of the night he calls out for one of us to be next to him to go back to sleep. Sometimes this might happen multiple times during the night. A couple of nights ago we reintroduced him to the sleep sack hoping it would help. So far it has not. Through our research it seems we might have transitioned out of the crib too soon. We're wondering if we should reintroduce him to the crib and go thru the sleep training process again. With the hope of reestablishing good sleep behavior and habits.  
Would appreciate any advice here. Thanks.",2024-11-08 22:46:35

Do you all just ignore family if it’s a family function?  Our kid is highly intelligent and knows exactly what is going on but I really don’t want to expose her to hate.

Three months later we had just put the deposit down for the venue and SURPRISE - pregnant. This was not our plan in the least and we weren't sure what we were going to do (after being told through bloodwork and some testing that getting pregnant naturally would be challenging - and the news didn't make me sad). But here we are with our bundle of joy. He's 17 months old and of course, we are in love with him. Still, it's challenging and to my friends who are on the fence about having a baby I tell them to really consider how much they love their current lifestyle lol.

ANYHOW - I still wanted it all - the big wedding, the bachelorette party, to feel beautiful in my wedding dress (and NOT breastfeeding) so we postponed. Our wedding day was beautiful and I am so glad we waited. Our son was the ring bearer and walked down the aisle with his cousins wearing a sign ""look Dada, here comes Mama!"" That Fri and Sat night of our wedding he did stay with my husbands folks and his aunt/uncle and cousins and did GREAT! But we still got to see him each day so that is different than being fully away for a week.

And now - our honeymoon. Originally we were going to Italy and France for 2 weeks but I of course do not feel comfortable doing that right now (and finances have shifted). We still want to get away together so heading to Puerto Vallarta (from WA State) for 6 nights/7 days. We bought flight with miles and also have a refundable stay at the resort if something were to come up - though of course we want to stay the full time.

We have daycare still during the week days but will have to have 3 different people staying with our boy but they will be coming to our home. My mother & father in law will be with him the longest and he knows them well. Then a very close family friend who has met him many times and has been over to witness our nighttime routine and one other dear friend of mine who has no kids of her own but nieces & nephews and I am not worried about it. The biggest worry on my end is his sleep. He is either a fantastic 11 hour sleeper or...it's a huge toss up. Keeping him on a strict schedule until we leave and doing our best but that would be my biggest concern. All in all, as long as he is with loving people and in his own home with a routine he is familiar with, I know he'll be just fine and it will more likely be me struggling to be in the moment with my husband. BUT I decided to just post here and see if any mommas have advice or suggestions (or just to tell me ""everything will be fine"").

Please no direct guilt for leaving though - I have been away from him for a couple nights before and my husband travels for work pretty regularly BUT at least one of us has always been with him overnight aside from those 2 during the wedding weekend.

parenting,1gmtn8u,My husband looses it with toddler ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmtn8u/my_husband_looses_it_with_toddler/,7,"Throwaway account. I always read posts about moms who are having issues with their partners and in my mind I think why you just don’t divorce him. But now I understand their hesitation. I never thought I would write this post, but here we are. Not sure if I’m seeking advice or just venting or I don’t know what this is but I need to get it out of my chest.

My (32f) husband (41m) have 2 kids, a 2yo toddler and a 5mo baby. Around 4 months into my first pregnancy, my husband and I got Covid and later he developed long covid symptoms. He has been struggling mentally and physically and it is actively going to doctors, physio and counselling. When my second was born, my toddler was about 22mo and my husband started to explode on him when my toddler didn’t listen to him. For example, my toddler will keep yelling even though we told him several times to stop. His explosions are yelling at my toddler, yanking my toddler to meet his eyes, etc. meanwhile my toddler is just crying and that makes my husband even more mad. My husband keep repeating to him to stop crying, that’s enough, etc. when this happens, I separate both of them by taking my toddler somewhere else and wait for everybody to calm down. Once my husband is calmer, he will explain what my toddler did wrong, what he did wrong and both of them will say sorry. My husband is always remorseful when this happens. He will blame himself, saying he lost control in the moment. It never gets to the point that he get physical with my toddler, but it happened way too often, about twice a week now. 

I’ve been trying to emphasize with my husband. He is dealing my a lot of mental issues, always in pain and tired because he can’t sleep well. But today it happened again and I think I’m in a point that this is enough. I was feeding and putting my baby to sleep in her room while my husband was eating lunch with my toddler. I heard my toddler crying so I went to them. My husband said that my toddler asked for milk, he gave it to him and my toddler consciously spilled the milk all over his clothes because he didn’t get what he wanted. My husband was already riled up, keep yelling at him and cursing. Once both settle down, my husband told my toddler that he had to listen next time, if not he will beat him.

If someone would tell me this situation, my advice would be to leave before things get worse. But I’m having a hard time acknowledging that this is MY situation. That this is the person I chose to have kids with and that he could hit my kids. I know that I have to do something, but I don’t know what. It seems like my only option is to take the kids and leave him but I’m scared and tired and I don’t feel I can do this alone.

My husband and I have been married for 3 years and have been together for 6 years. Before we were married, we discussed having children and he was open to the idea. However when we started trying, he realized he didn't want kids. When he wanted to discuss with me more seriously about his feelings about not wanting kids, I was already pregnant. Our baby is 7 months currently and my husband has been really struggling with fatherhood. He knew he wouldn't enjoy it, but it's been worse than he imagined. He has severe depression and thoughts of suicide. He prioritizes freedom and autonomy and wants to spend his time doing the things he wants to do, not caretaking for a baby or being a father. We already have a nanny and my mom who take turns to help out during the day time, since he works full-time and I go to school. At night, we sleep separately, I sleep with the baby, so my husband can get unbroken sleep. I would say he only spends 30 minutes to an hour with the baby a day and most of the time, it's really hard for him and he feels like killing himself. He's currently seeing a therapist, but I don't know if it's helping because his depression has been getting worse. We are also seeing a couples therapist. He also says he 100% does not want another child, but I really want 2 kids.

Initially, it was extremely important to me to try and breastfeed him for the first year. All I had in my birth plan was to do a golden hour with him of uninterrupted skin to skin contact, where I was planning to practice latching. I didn't get that because he had fluid in his lungs and had to be rushed to the nicu. When we brought him home, I practiced latching but we struggled for awhile so I had to feed him colostrum from a baby syringe most feedings. By day 3, my milk came in and I was immediately an oversupplyer. I made 4 oz per breast every 2 or 3 hours so I had to pump after every feeding. By the end of week 1, I was making 8 oz per breast everytime I pumped and had tons of milk in storage. We finally got latching down and I was feeling good, but then my baby started to have extremely bad colic to the point that he was awake and screaming almost 24/7. I cut dairy, whey, nuts, ""spicy foods"" and ""gassy foods"" out of my diet completely. This helped with the colic a little bit but not enough. My dad told me my brother had the same issue and they had to switch him to formula and suggested I try half and half. I was upset about it at first, but I tried it and it made a huge difference. He wasn't screaming constantly anymore, but he still wasn't sleeping much and would wake up gassy from time to time and need help getting it all out. After about 2 weeks of that, my husband came home to see that I had only eaten dry cereal and sunflower seeds that day because we couldn't afford many groceries and I couldn't eat most of what we had in the house. He told me I needed to make the full switch to formula because it wasn't healthy for either of us the way I was eating. I cried about it alot but made the transition and now he doesn't have colic issues at all. Still though, he barely ever sleeps. In fact, he's awake all day long with naps here and there that never last more than 20 minutes, but typically average 5 minutes. He gets more tired at night, but will only sleep in 1-2 hour increments between about 10 pm to 6 am. I'm so exhausted, both physically and emotionally.

Lately I’m feeling like I’m waiting for things to get easier, but they’re actually feeling harder. I thought at this point, with all the practice of recognizing the blue/green/yellow/red zones, reading she appropriste books like “Anh’s Anger” “a super hero called self control” “Sam’s pet temper” and adult books like “Raising your Spirited child” “Good Inside” and “the Explosive child” as well as the development of his prefrontal cortex, we’d be seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, but the last two months have proven more difficult than ever. 
At home we are getting massive meltdowns that involve attempts to hit and kick( loud screaming, just complete dysregulation, despite our efforts to co regulate, and try to help him recognize when these things start arising. He has been waking at night from bad dreams, and when we’re able to actually get information out of him, he’ll say “grade one is hard, I have to do so many things” so I can tell the stress of it is manifesting. He is a very social outgoing guy, has lots of friends, regularly has playdates. 

At school his teacher says he’s mostly ok, follows along, does great in terms of school work (reading really well now for the last year) but struggles with resilience, in terms of bouncing back after hard feelings. I’m aware of “restraint collapse” and that he’s probably keeping it somewhat together at school, and we are receiving the brunt of the emotional escalations at home, but he has had two incidents at school where he pushed a friend over, and kicked a bigger kid in the school yard. He is clearly having a hard time with impulse control and again, his explosive feelings. 

We recently met with a psychologist (who is very expensive !!) and has said this sounds like it’s still in the realm of what’s normal for a kid his age. We have found her advice and guidance to be on par with all the books we have read, and so applying the techniques we already have been. We are feeling very stuck. We feel like we can’t do normal stuff like enroll him in extracurriculars, because he mentally can’t seem to handle more than what’s on his plate. 
The normal techniques that seem to work with your average kid just don’t seem to get through with him. We’ve had some success lately with the tasks he’s normally find difficult (transitions) and getting dressed, brushing teeth, hair washing. We make them very routine and predictable and we have found some ease in these areas. We’ve had to back off on certain independent things like packing his lunch in his backpack, or making his bed, because he seems so overwhelmed already and ends up being a battle of the wills which is pretty counterproductive in our big picture of helping him just function with the normal every day stuff. 

Im not sure what to do anymore? ADHD is such a hot topic these days, but there are some things that may point to that?  He’s also young for a diagnosis here, no? In the “explosive child” he says a diagnosis may help you understand your child’s behaviours but still doesn’t help them build the skills they’re lacking. But we keep trying to help him build those skills, and we’re not seeing the progress. Maybe we need to give it more time and consistency. 

Anyway, if anyone has been in my shoes, advice? Words of wisdom? It’s creating such a stress in our family dynamic and between my partner and I. I have some very crappy basic insurance coverage for things like therapy, psychiatry, psychology and feeling like we may be beyond what the current psychologist is guiding us to do.

parenting,1gm2ygv,Teen internet safety not going as planned,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gm2ygv/teen_internet_safety_not_going_as_planned/,111,"Internet safety with teens.

I have my daughter a phone when she had just gone 11 as she kept using mine to FaceTime her friends and cousins, and she needed it for safety. She was the last one left without a phone out of all her friends. 
No issues for that first year and a half (as far as I’m aware). She knew what apps she isn’t allowed and what she can and can’t do. I trusted her (in hindsight stupidly).

She’s now 13+
Recently however she’s started going against the rules and 1. Using TikTok 2. Joining chats with friends that also have people in that she doesn’t know 3. Posting public videos on TikTok with her face in 4. Messaging a stranger from the joint chats and trying to create a relationship 5. Using Reddit!

That has all happened gradually and each time she did something I had a stern word and explained (again) dangers and risks and how it’s an absolute no no. She sits and says she understands but then goes and does it again. So I changed the settings on her phone and became more restrictive. 

Since then she has repeatedly attempted to do the same things or bend the rules. She’s somehow also managed to upload TikTok videos without the app.. I assume through browser?

I’m totally fed up and I’ve taken her phone away from her now. I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt and trying to retrust her and she has blown it every single time despite me reiterating the same things about danger and safety etc. 
she genuinely seems to not give a shit…..

The issues: 
1. For safety she needs a phone, she attends groups and volunteering etc. 
2. If I got her an old crappy basic phone, I fear that when she’s a little older she will just resort to doing the same crap except more dangerous as she will be 16+ and have more free will?! Like a new novelty of a phone again. Kinda like when you stop a kid eating candy and then when they finally get some they go absolutely wild for it.
3. HOW can I get through to her so that she DOESN’T WANT TO DO THESE THINGS?!😭

Please no judgement, I’m already beating myself up for being too trusting. ",2024-11-07 22:23:46

But now the worst part: it could be cancerous and we will know about a day after the surgery. The cancer would be very well treatable via radioiodine therapy. 

This means: every few weeks I will have to go to hospital and swallow a very radioactive pill. After that I can't see anyone for a few days and need to keep 2 meters distance to my baby for two weeks! I am freaking out!! This for at least 2-3 Times.

parenting,1gmmlg2,gifted testing/education for k -- is it scam?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmmlg2/gifted_testingeducation_for_k_is_it_scam/,7,"Our 4.5 yr daughter just tested gifted (> 99.9%) and got offers from gifted schools in our city for K. But I heard lots of people say ""giftedness"" at young age doesn't mean anything and will mostly even out at age 8, so I am quite hesitant about sending her there. Any suggestions?

pros: She went to two different dc (one reggio and one Montessori) and got very bored in both schools. It was her Montessori teacher who suggests us to take her for gifted testing (we didn't even know this thing could be tested so early) and she thinks our daughter would fit better in a gifted program. We took our daughter to school tours and she does show stronger interests in gifted schools (compare to no interest in our neighborhood school and two private schools nearby). But I don't think this first impression thing means anything.

cons: The closest gifted program is 30min from our house and I don't see the point of wasting 1hr on commute everyday if the school is not much different from a neighborhood school. Plus if our daughter will even out at 8, what is the point of doing the commuting thing for 3 yrs?

So I guess the question comes to: Is gifted education from k-g3 a real thing? Does it worth the time commuting? Any thoughts are appreciated!

Some information about my daughter. She is around 2nd grade in reading and 4th grade in math. We don't speak English at home and she is around 2nd grade reading in our home language. We are not sure what she likes--her interest changes every three months and right now is cello (but I would say pretty bad at it LOL). She is VERY bored in school, and complains a lot of it. Her dad and my sister both tested gifted at \~9 yrs old and was in gifted education since then. So we know gifted education is real after 9 but before that? Not so sure.",2024-11-08 16:30:15

Totally false. But I believed him for a few minutes.

He plays alone very well, but lately picking him up from daycare I've been getting rough reports. 

He is a biter. I know it is age appropriate and when he does bite, we sternly tell him biting is not okay or that biting hurts, etc. Or we try and redirect. I have notice he bites when he is frustrated or over-stimulated. It's an uphill battle and I hope that he grows out of this, but now it's being reported by daycare, and I am getting worried. 

Today I was talking with his teacher and he had a bad day yesterday. Like I said, he plays well by himself, but with other kids, she said he doesn't play well. He is all up in their business, won't leave them alone, taking toys. I can only imagine this is because he just isn't use to playing with other kids his age, but I have no idea what could make this better. I can only assume, over time, he will be more use to the daycare setting, but I am worried he will get kicked out before then.

First couple weeks were fine—my wife had an injury limiting mobility and was still off work, which led to my doing all driving and carrying baby room to room. So, day care was a short relief each day.

But the past 2 weeks gave us trepidation—inconsistent communication through the app, claiming she had a fever when she didn’t, exasperation that our baby cries so much, not updating the app with all new times while claiming she’d gone through all her bottles. Little stuff but adds up.

Yesterday I was watching the live feed of the infant room, and ours is the only immobile infant in there so she had been set on the floor on a mat. The other kids, barely able to walk, are stumbling around and it really looked like one of the kids stepped on our girl’s hand. If our girl started wailing or crying you wouldn’t know it based on the non-reaction of the teachers.

We got suddenly anxious and immediately drove to pick her up.

The past few weeks have been a nightmare with him throwing fits at every little thing that doesn’t go his way. Mainly they are occurring during activity transition periods like he’s playing with toys, but we need to go get ready for school, or watching a movie, but we need to go brush our teeth and get ready for bed. 

We’ve tried timeout which just brings him to screaming bloody murder then entire time we are in timeout and then once over we are back to square one because he still doesn’t want to do the task at hand. 

We’ve tried taking away a toy or an activity (like if you don’t listen and get ready for bed we aren’t going to have time to read your bedtime story, an activity he enjoys that is in the immediate future). If we do this he hyper focuses on the thing we are taking away and it brings him to hitting and pinching us out of anger. It’s important to note we do not spank or hit him so we have no idea where this is coming from. 

We’ve also tried just sitting him down and trying to talk through why he’s angry, we ask him to communicate with us and we express love for him and give hugs saying we understand but need to do xyz still. This can work initially, but he still holds on to some sort of resentment that we are still transitioning from 1 activity to another and he can never fully get over it. 

We are just at a loss for what the best approach is here. My gut says love and understanding is always the answer, but when you express that for 20 min and he’s still screaming and hitting it’s so hard to maintain that mindset and not get angry with him.

My other kid was super social, so I never had to deal with this issue, and I am not sure what, if anything, I should be doing about it. 

The toddler goes to a family daycare 4-5 days a week, and he has no issue there. He either goes happily or settles very quickly when I leave, and he has a great day. He apparently doesn't like it when the care coordinator visits (cos she's a stranger, but he warms up after 20 or so mins). 

At the park, he will play happily and range around if there is no-one there. If there are other people, he stays away from them or close to me and won't start ranging until 20 or so minutes passes. If anyone talks to him, he runs straight back to me. 

During organised activities (like song time at the library), he goes rigid and pushes himself into me until it stops. But he has no problem ranging about so long as noone tries to interact with him.

If we are somewhere other than home or daycare and he can't see one of me/his dad/his brother, he throws a tantrum, including banging his head on the floor. As long as at least one of us is in sight, he's fine. 

Generally he's a super independent dude. He self settles to sleep, prefers not to be touched when upset unless he asks for a pick up, etc. SO SO different from #1! 

I worry about avoiding social settings just because he doesnt like them. I feel like exposure is better. But am I affecting him by putting him in that uncomfortable atmosphere when he's still young? I also worry that his independent nature means his attachment isn't as secure as it should be, as evidenced by the tantrums if he thinks he's alone in an unfamiliar place.

They do not care at all. We've been ""training"" for a year and a half or more.

They will pee when we manually go take them to the bathroom every 2ish hours, but never poop. (They're save that for their underwear or pull-ups, no matter how often we take them to the restroom) And they never initiate the potty breaks. They'll just go where they are and don't care if they're wet or dirty, even if fully soaked through.

Pediatrician isn't concerned. He just said, ""Oh they'll get it in time. Just keep offering candy and put them with other kids who are potty trained."" Not super helpful.

Any advice? ",2024-11-08 14:36:01
parenting,1gm85b0,"Daughter almost 7, still sucking her thumb",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gm85b0/daughter_almost_7_still_sucking_her_thumb/,23,"I (dad) was a late thumb sucker myself, but stopped when I was 6, I believe after kindergarten.

My amazing daughter is in 1st grade however and is turning 7 in late December. I wanted her to naturally grow out of it, but I'm getting concerned it isn't just going to magically happen at this point.

She has a lovey (or dou dou as some call it) and it's her trigger for thumb sucking. She grabs the lovey, thumbs goes in the mouth.

She has for some time given us her lovey in the morning and we give it back to her at night, such that she doesn't thumb suck during the day.

A long while ago we completely took away her lovey - in fact she willingly gave it up - but she evolved lol, she started sucking her thumb w/o the lovey, using any soft cloth as her trigger.

About her - she's a sweet girl, smart as a whip, very funny. She understands that it is effecting her teeth and she'll 100% need braces. When she, as everyone does eventually, gets frustrated, tired, angry or sad, she seeks her lovey. The combination of the lovey and the thumb sucking soothes her, helps her reset, and then come back anew.

I've told her my theory on how she uses the lovey/thumb for self-soothing and she seems to agree. I've told her she's really great at knowing when she needs comfort or a moment to herself, but she needs to find a different way to have that moment. Toward that end, I've discussed with her giving up the lovey / thumb sucking and using other strategies - special hugs, curl up into a ball (her idea), close her eyes and hold her squishmallow (meditate, her idea), deep breathe (same), etc.

I'm going to work with her to use those strategies, but I'm seeking some advice/guidance from others here as well.

I don't want to use a thumbguard and I don't want to forcefully take away her lovey, it feels cruel but maybe I'm being a bit soft on that front.",2024-11-08 02:30:55

Did you value having a parent at home or did you value seeing your parents working? 

Would you have preferred the opposite?

For example my mom worked outside the home as a nurse and I always wished I had a mom at home to attend all my events, but my spouse had a stay at home mom and wished he had a mom who had a career. We now have a 3 month old and this is my first week back to work. I wonder if in her life she will have wished she had a stay at home parent or if seeing her mom and dad working will make her proud.

He does really well when he tries and applies himself with studying/practice but its always difficult to get him to hunker down and get it done.He often thinks he can just skip homework and studying, that he'll do fine on tests. He's disproven his own theory a few times when he didn't do his homework and didn't study then got a bad mark on a unit test. I'm trying to teach him how to study/take notes etc. so he can do it on his own but he works best when I'm with him for now.

My problem is the struggle to get to the table and I'm hoping some parents have advice thats worked for them. It gets bad enough that I usually end up threatening to take away his phone to get him to come and do it. 
I get that he needs to relax after a long school day so I he relaxes/unwinds for an hour or two and then we do homework. I also understand that at his age he needs to feel like he's in control and not constantly told or forced to do things. I try to be as lenient as possible in other areas but homework is crucial since he'll be starting high school next year. Im just at a loss and its extremely frustrating that it takes a bout an hour of arguing to get him to sit and then a wasted 30min of me trying to explain crap to him that he KNOWS but likes to be stubborn and pretend he doesn't know anything in protest. I want him to succeed and I want him to learn but I can't make him want these things. He's seen himself how important studying and practice are but it's always a problem.
I remember protesting homework too but it was more like an eye-roll and slowly taking out my notebooks to procrastinate for 5min but not wasting an hour and a half with antics. I end up getting so frustrated I just have to walk away but then he gets off doing nothing since I then have a list of things to do with my other 2 kids. My 7yo sits nicely when asked the first time, doesn't want my help past an explanation, and completes it all in about 30min with no complaints. Why can't it be that easy with the 13yo?

I'm finding this all extremely odd and don't know how to help my son deal with this loss.
The week before all this the former friend told his mum that my son was bullying and making fun of him. The context I have been given of this is just silly joking around that this boy would do himself, ie playing a game and missing a shot and saying ""aww you suck!"".
The mother who I thought I had a good relationship with is ghosting me as well.

i (55f) have three adult children, two boys (23m) and (21m) and a daughter (18f). we live in a house which we rent. we all work, my husband works long hours but the rent is very expensive so his portion is pretty much all the rent and a few of the bills, i work so my portion covers the rest of the bills, groceries and leaves maybe $500 max a week for “fun money” (takeout, little gifts for everyone, new clothes, ect.) im not sure how much my sons get paid but they both work full time and based on how much stuff they buy for themselves, its enough. my daughter only works casual at the moment and whenever she knows we’re struggling financially, she always sends some money (rarely asks, she just wants to soften the blow). in the house it is me, my husband, and all three children. my eldest son lives half the week here with his girlfriend, the the other half of the week they are both at the girlfriends house. my second son has his girlfriend and or friends over very often, my daughter doesnt have people around much but when she does she always tidies up the house before hand. my sons constantly complain that theres no food to eat because we’re an “ingredient household”, they know how to cook, theyre just a bit lazy, my daughter can cook and cooks for the family a fair amount. my daughter complains often because she is constantly cleaning up after her brothers in the common spaces (wet towels on the floor, dirty clothes in the bathtub, beard trimmings on the basin, ect.) and additionally, they spend so much time in their rooms that the rooms have a stench of boy body odour from them playing their consoles and whatever else theyre doing in there. 

 anyway, the point here is that my daughter thinks its unfair that they “get away with not contributing” which i agree, ive asked for help but i constantly get undermined by my husband who enables their laziness (issue for another day). my daughter says “they need to understand that living with a roof over their head is a privilege, not a right when over 18. i do the chores of three and they do nothing, the least they can do is help out financially”. as much as i see her side, i fear that asking them for help will be seen as an attack, they might oblige but then if they find its not suitable for them, they’ll threaten/will move out, then we’re stuffed because if we NEEDED help they arent there. (we get by with our incomes but god forbid something happened, we have no emergency fund) plus we dont have the financial stability to move out into a 2 bedroom to downsize to just my daughter, husband and i (which she would love that 😂) 

there has been a few times ive asked for rent but it never lasts, all i want is $50 a week from each of them (my daughters idea and even shes willing to pay too) my daughter understands she has no authority to ask the boys to help us but she gets frustrated and sometimes slips up, so thats an added worry of why they mightnt help, and i dont get how they are like this, i mean i taught and raise all my kids the same, how is it that only my youngest understands the struggles and financially difficulties of adulting. (she laughs at the thought of the boys moving out because she doesnt think theyll survive once shes not there to “do all the magic fairy cleaning”)

ive worked out the maths side of it for some easier understanding 

$50 times 3 = $150 a week
$150 times 52 = $7800 aud a year

50 times 52 = $2600 aud from each child a year. 

thats probably a total of a fortnights worth of pay for each of my boys, and probably a months pay for my daughter (shes currently looking for a second job so probably less soon) plus thats over a year stretch, i do not think this is an outlandish ask and i want to just ask them but i dont want them to feel “robbed” or “forced”, i just cant take the financial stress anymore, truthfully i need to win the lottery.",2024-11-08 13:17:12

She fights him on it to the point my son is upset so we leave to let him calm down. Well that turns into him totally freaking out and him screaming for me(his bio mom) for a little over 30 minutes. I start to go upstairs and she stops me says it's about the way he didn't ask nicely and some times the parent knows what he needs. As a mother I have everything in me telling me I need to comfort my son who is absolutely freaking out but on the other hand I have someone who has some experience in child development but not as an actual mother herself. I feel like I completely abandoned my son that night when he needed me. Over something stupid like calming music to the point he was screaming for me and I did nothing. Did I do the right thing by doing nothing or did I cause trauma that could have 100% been avoided. Why argue with a 7 yo over music? Therefore prolonging the sleep he needed. ,2024-11-08 02:42:27

I’m really struggling, and I don’t know where else to turn. My life has been a rollercoaster, especially when it comes to family.

When I was 14, my mom kicked me out, and I went to live with my grandma. I was on my own by 16, and not long after, I met my husband, who I’ve now been with for 11 years. We have three amazing kids, ages 10, 8, and 6.

But since my youngest was born, it feels like my family has just been disappearing one by one. The day after my 6-year-old was born, my aunt, who had been battling cancer, passed away. A year and a half later, I lost my mom. And then, just two years after that, my sister passed away too. Now it feels like there’s no family left—no one for my kids to grow up around, and I feel so alone.

The sadness just sits with me all the time now, and it’s like a weight I can’t shake. I’m heartbroken that my kids are growing up without extended family, and it’s killing me. I’m doing my best to be there for them, but I feel like I’m running out of strength. I don’t know how to keep myself going sometimes, let alone how to make sure my kids don’t feel this emptiness too.

Since I had a baby in August, it’s been the one thing that has allowed me to manage both kids’ needs and focus on the baby for a while when he plays on it.

Over the past few months, though, his attitude and constant whining have been really difficult to handle. It starts as soon as he wakes up, continues until I drop him off at school, and then picks back up the moment he’s home until bedtime. Nothing I say or do seems to be right, and if I can’t find the “perfect” solution to his frustrations, it turns into a full-blown meltdown. I’ve always tried to set reasonable boundaries, but it feels like all of that is slipping away. The only time he isn’t whining or sulking is when he’s on his tablet, so I end up letting him use it so I can get things done, like making dinner or putting the baby to sleep.

It’s really affecting my mental health and affecting us as a family, I want to enjoy being a mom of two, but right now, I feel like I can’t stand to be around my son and dread the afternoons when he comes home from school.

My question is: could this behavior be due to his screen time on the tablet? We read before bed, and he usually turns off the tablet without a fight when I ask him to, but I wonder if it’s only because he knows he’ll have more access to it later.

Has anyone had success with completely eliminating tablet time, and did it make a big difference in behavior? Any advice would be so appreciated.

parenting,1gmfg34,How do you teach teens the importance of apologizing when they do wrong?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmfg34/how_do_you_teach_teens_the_importance_of/,1,"I’m 36f and my husband is 40m. We have 3 stepdaughters together ages 15, 13, and 11. We have been together for 8 years.  Our 11 year old (she’ll be 12 in 4 months) just started 6th grade and I’m already starting to mourn the fact she’s not a kid anymore. Over the summer we predicted it was probably her last one just being a kid before she goes into the full blown teen phase - we were right. 

She started middle school in a new school district this year and is very popular. I guess she’s changed her personality to be cool or something. She’s developed an attitude, is acting like a spoiled brat, and she’s hurting feelings left and right with how rude she’s turning out to be. She often makes her two older sisters cry with how awful and insensitive she can be to them. She has often hurt my feelings as well and often times I feel like she only comes to me when she wants something… it’s hurting my relationship with her which used to be really solid. I’ve been in her life since she was too young to remember and it felt like we used to have a good bond.

 I have tried my best to always be a good example when it comes to teaching our girls to apologize for rude and insensitive behavior over the years. Unfortunately their father and their bio mother have not done such a good job with this, and since our girls spend more time at their mom’s (we have them every other weekend when it comes to custody), I can only do so much as far as teaching them morals and values that are important, like being kind, respectful, and saying “I’m sorry”. My husband seldom steps in to correct and coach them, especially when I’m blatantly disrespected. He usually steps back and lets me handle it. He’s awful at apologizing too. Any time we ever have a disagreement in which both of us hurt feelings I am always the first to apologize or try to come together to make amends. It’s one of the things I’ve told him he needs to work on for our marriage to be successful.

So what should I do? In this instance, she talked back to me in the family group text and I responded this way: “Thank you (SD15 and SD13) for taking the time to read and reply to my text messages and for being kind and respectful. I am disappointed in the way you just talked back to me (SD11). At times you can be very rude and disrespectful and you should be more mindful of the way you come across to people because you hurt feelings. Have a nice night girls.” Then I talked to my husband about it because he ignored the behavior, told me to ignore it, but then I sent the above text anyway. He said I already handled it with my message and that I should have listened to him when he told me to ignore her, and I said I was still frustrated because she hasn’t apologized for her rudeness and offensiveness. If I hadn’t sent the text, the behavior would have gone unchecked and my husband wouldn’t address it until a week from today when we see the girls in person (that’s if he actually chooses to address it at all because the “right moment” to do so would have already passed in a week’s time). 

I feel as though he and his ex wife are continually enabling the behavior because they’re not teaching them the importance of saying “I’m sorry” if they hurt someone. Otherwise, all three of these girls would be better at apologizing. So what’s the best way to teach these teens to apologize? How can I help as a stepmom? ",2024-11-08 10:25:27

parenting,1gmrp8h,Teen daughter doesn't take pride in her appearance ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gmrp8h/teen_daughter_doesnt_take_pride_in_her_appearance/,40,"My 13-year-old daughter dresses in the same 3 outfits. At the beginning of the school year, we went shopping together and had a fun time. The problem is she doesn't wear any of the new clothing. Wears brown, black, olive and tan colored clothing. I suggest wearing other clothing, but it falls on deaf ears.  

I also took her to a hair salon for a Keratin treatment and a haircut. For 3 days, her hair looked beautiful. Afterwards she washed it and refuses to use a hairdryer. It gets very frizzy. The night before 8th grade started, she cut her hair 5 inches on each side. I didn't realize what she had done because her hair is so thick and curly. My husband (her father) hates the way that she dresses and her hairstyle. We recently had a family party for her older brother and family and friends asked us what is going on with her hair because it looks like no one cares about her. My husband thinks it's a cry for help.

She has yearbook pictures coming up and Confirmation, Middle School graduation. I recently made a hair appointment for her. I try to be kind and understanding and not say mean things. I made suggestions like go online and look for new hairstyles that you like get some ideas for the appointment. She gets upset and has a very bad attitude. She cries and says no one at school cares how she looks. She looks at me like she hates me. I told her that she doesn't have to get her hair cut very short, but it needs to be styled and have some layers put in because the sides are so much shorter than the back. I even offered to buy her something at the salon (they sell brownies and cool mystical items).

I understand that Middle School is a rough time. I'm a stay-at-home mom. I'm always around to help. Whenever, she wants/needs anything I help her. I really try to make her happy. Whenever, she asks for a toy we buy it for her. Today she told me that she ran out of rubber bands for her braces. I called the orthodontist to find out when I can pick them up.

She hates school but is incredible smart. It breaks my heart because she is a beautiful girl, but she takes no pride in her appearance. I offer to help her style her hair in the morning before school, but she refuses. I used to help her before school when she was younger. She came out about 3 years ago. We love and completely support and accept our daughter. She belongs to a club at school and goes to meetings 2x a month. I'm always encouraging her to invite friends over. Every once in a while, that happens, most of the time she likes to do her own thing.

When she was younger, she was bullied at school I and was having issues with her peeing in her room on the carpet or on stuffed animals. I even put a commode in her room. She complained about having a UTI so I took her to the pediatrician and even a pediatric urologist. Physically she was fine, but they suggested that she needed therapy.  She was in therapy for 2 years, but it didn't help. She dug her heels in and hated it, so we stopped going. She no longer has accidents in her room. When she was bullied, I contacted her teacher and the principal, and they handled it very well at school.

I just want her to be happy and to help her. Any suggestions?

But I still thought I had a good relationship with all my kids, I don’t miss a parents evening I go all out for costume day I spend every penny I have on them and every bit of time I have is for them. I even get my two younger children minded once a week just to spend a night with my older ones (my ten year old and her big sister). Anyway it’s come about six months ago that my daughters dad began to say things like I don’t brush her hair for school, I let her mind the other kids, she’s really unhappy here, she cries when he’s sending her home. When this was said I was so shocked and confused I spoke to my daughter who said she didn’t understand why he was saying these things. This has gone on for six months I have been scared to send her I have been calling him delusional I have even contacted social services I was so worried about what was going on in the time they were spending together as these claims were so wild to me. 3 days ago he phones me and although I don’t like him (which I keep to myself) something in his voice just made me believe him. So I asked her - and almost straight away she just admitted that she says these things about me and like quite nonchalantly. I was mortified and I asked her why? Why does she say these things about me? Does she actually feel this way? I even cried when I was talking to her just because my feelings are so hurt, and basically she just says she doesn’t know why she says it, she doesn’t feel this way about me. But she does get on better with her dad she said, since then I feel so weird about her I think if I had something to work with you know like I.e I was jealous of the other kids or mum when you do this/this/this you hurt my feelings just anything at this point I’m desperate for anything to work with. But just nothing she doesn’t seem to understand or feel anything about the trouble she’s caused for me and her dad, or how much she’s hurt my feelings. Just met with a blank stare really.

Does anyone else have parents who think their grandchild can do absolutely no wrong?

My toddler (3 and a half) was mad at childcare today. He punched a staff member in the stomach, started a fight with another kid, threw toys and ripped up a book. The childcare staff are amazing and communicated really well with us about it. As a consequence, my kiddo has had a good talk with us about respecting people’s bodies, no after dinner treat, and he’s going to chose one of his own books to donate to replace the one he trashed. He has so many books, he won’t miss one. He also says he wants to write a ‘sorry card’ to the staff member he hit, which I think is sweet of him and probably appropriate!

But when his grandparents got word of this they wailed about how he was such a great kid (he is), how it was probably the fault of the people at his childcare and that we’ve been too harsh with him. I explained that while yes he is young and behaviours like this are somewhat expected with toddlers, he still needs to learn that it isn’t okay.

To start things off, in the hospital I was able to collect colostrum and feed that to my baby. A lactation consultant visited and told me that the latch looked great but my baby has a hard time staying awake to feed which is not helping my milk production. Fast forward a couple of days later, I end up in the hospital due to severe constipation. I tried everything, miralax, stool softener pills, magnesium citrate, and a suppository at home. None of this worked. I was in so much pain and felt an insane amount of pressure back there combined with the pain of a 3rd degree tear. I got not one, but two enemas in the hospital. I was under so much stress and not able to breastfeed or pump or anything due to this. So we had to give our daughter formula while I was in the hospital. The next day, we found out have to bring in my daughter for blue light therapy for jaundice. The doctors said that this was most likely due to not eating enough. While staying there I would breastfeed her, then pump afterwards while my husband gave her formula to see how much she ate. Thankfully we were able to discharge the next day and go home. I have been so worried about the jaundice not getting better that I have been pumping to see what exact amount I get so that I know she is being fed enough. Sometimes I get enough or even more than she needs while other times I barely get anything. It’s like my body is failing me and I can’t get into a consistent pattern. We brought her in for her one week check up and her jaundice went up a little but they said this is supposed to be expected since it peaks. I saw lactation the next day to check how things were going and I breastfed her there so they could weigh how much she ate. She ended up eating 3 oz during that visit and the lactation specialist said that I am probably good to just breastfeed and then top her off with formula if I feel like it was not a productive feed. This gave me so much joy and hope that I am finally producing enough. Well when I got home, it seemed like my milk wasn’t enough and she was still hungry. We offered her formula after and she ate it every single time. So now I am back to this guilty stage where my mental health keeps declining. It’s all that I think about. I am now pumping again to see how much and once again it is all over the place. Sometimes it’s 70 ml while other times it’s 20 ml. I just don’t know what to do and feel so lost and hopeless. I’m debating just giving her formula but I feel guilty about that. Maybe I should combination feed where I give her pumped milk and formula.

Most recent, we were at a friend's house whom invited me and them with their siblings to carve pumpkins they purchased. They made rice crispies and my oldest stood near them which none of us thought anything of, then later that day they informed me that my child ate every piece of candy but one off each square (before leaving, he stopped carving and was sitting on their couch where i seen him trying to quietly stick his hand into their candy bag to take some while peering at me through his side eye). 

When he was younger, his dad and I made a big deal about taking snacks or junk or whatever without asking out of fear it would only progress, while everyone told us we shouldn't give trouble for him wanting to eat. Meanwhile that wasn't the case for us, it was not about being hungry. It was about what he was taking and knowing it was things that needed to be asked for, 1 because it isn't healthy and 2 they have ADHD so some things just worsen the symptoms.

He’s now 5.5 months and it has been battle after battle with sleep and just general frustration. 

He started rolling over on his tummy around the same time as the sleep regression started and because he can’t fully get himself back over he just wakes up in the middle of the night and screams and we have to come soothe him. This is happening 4-5x a night.

My oldest (13) goes to catholic school. We got an email this morning that he blurted out a racist joke in class. My wife and I are horrified. I never thought a kid of mine would say something like that.

While debating what the punishments will be, it's got me thinking I'd really just like to purge YouTube from the home completely. We've got 3 kids: 13, 10, 8. YouTube does something different and awful for each of them.

The 13 year old, who has ADHD and anxiety disorder, gets into these rednecky outdoors videos. They're ostensibly about fishing, hunting, outdoors survival but I'm guessing a lot of the guys have a mixture of intolerant and narrow minded views.

The 10 year old has zero behavior problems and is very kind, and is also neurotypical, but zones out to these stupid vignette of girls acting dumb and bratty...it's not toxic stuff but just really shallow.

Our 8 year old likewise is very kind and has no behavior problems, but is autistic and gets sucked into watching these weird Minecraft videos where two people babble back and forth to one another in near gibberish and its like everything is said at 1.5x normal speed. I worry it's hacking his brain and robbing him of any kind of attention span. 

So I really just want to blow the whole thing up and yank it from all of them. Curious if other parents have gone no-YouTube cold turkey, and if so, what their experience was? It's like all my kids watch. My mid child kind of likes old 90s and 00s sitcoms but other than that I can't remember the last time any of them wanted to watch any kind of movie or show that wasn't from a YouTube creator.

My wife and I admit we have been too lax with technology. We do have their devices controlled under Google Family Link but they're on them too much.

I'm a first-time dad expecting a baby girl at the end March.  As I'm a car guy who takes car of our car stuff, I've been tasked with finding the car seat.  I've done a little research, but since this is our first kid I have no idea what I should be looking for.  For the sake of product recommendations, we're in the U.S.  Some questions/parameters:

1. Safety is the first priority obviously.  We'll also be moving the seat between two cars so easy installation is a plus.  What are other features you find useful/important?

2. Thoughts on LATCH vs. Seatbelt vs. ""European Method"" anchoring styles?  Which do you find easiest for installation/transfer/safety?

3. Infant seat vs. Convertible - based on what I've read so far it seems like convertibles are a little bit of a hassle with newborns, but I'm also seeing that once the baby has some head control or reaches about six months or age or so, some babies find the infant seats uncomfortable.  What are your experiences?

Any advice is appreciated!",2024-11-08 05:24:24

My oldest turned 21 today and my baby girl turned 13 in November. I am a single mom. I am working on my doctorate. These girls get whatever they want.

The 21 year old went to a prestigious college and flunked out her freshman year. My mom bailed her out and now she is in a local community college. 

The oldest waltzed in my bedroom around 1:00 am asking what was today…. I realized it was her bday and so I texted all of my family and friends to at least say happy bday. While doing that, I absolutely know that she has received $150 from that - probably more, but I’m not sure.

I slept the day away. My youngest came home and asked were we going out to eat. In my head, I said hell no. I ended up feeling guilty bc I know the oldest deserves everything the youngest one gets.

But now I am feeling guilty because the baby girl (13) got special treatment on her bday and I am wore the hell out on the oldest’s bday (today).

My dad died in April and, not only am I still dealing with grief, but I work in finance. When I turned 21, I had established everything on my own.

My husband has taken off work tomorrow so we as a family can go see her one last time. This would be classified as a family emergency in our opinion.

My daughter (7F) has always been a little scared of thunderstorms, but over the past year, her fear has become almost unmanageable. As soon as she hears a rumble of thunder or even sees dark clouds rolling in, she’ll start to panic. We’re talking full-on crying, hiding under her blanket, and begging me to “make it stop.” It’s gotten to the point where she won’t leave the house if there’s even a chance of a storm.

We live in an area where thunderstorms aren’t uncommon, so avoiding them completely just isn’t possible. I’ve tried everything I can think of to reassure her – explaining how storms work, using calming techniques, and even making up silly stories about “friendly thunder.” Nothing seems to calm her down once she’s in that state of panic. Her heart races, she shakes, and she clings to me like her life depends on it.

I feel terrible because I know the fear is real for her, but it’s also impacting our daily life. We’ve missed out on events and activities because she just can’t handle being outside when there’s even a hint of a storm coming. I’m worried this anxiety is going to hold her back in more ways as she grows older.

Has anyone else dealt with this level of fear in their kids? Is it time to consider some kind of professional help, or are there other methods I can try first? I just want her to feel safe and not be overwhelmed by something that’s out of our control.

We are starting sleep training because my 6 month old is 22lbs and I cannot bounce him to sleep for 45 minutes anymore. He wants to comofort suck on my boob AND be bounced simultaneously and it's too much. He's also going to grow out of the swing so it needs to be done! 

He did great last night with bedtime, today first 2 naps with caregiver (nonrelative whom he's known for 3 weeks). Today he fussed for 1 hour, every time I went in to soothe him at intervals of 1 min, 2 mins, 3 mins etc he got very awake and excited to see me, even though he was overtired. I work from home and try to take breaks throughout the day to nurse and play with him. But I feel like I excite him so much that I overstimulate him. I finally just gave up and put him in thr swing because he was overtired and going from happy/excited to crying. 

He doesn't keep a pacifier in his mouth very well (he did better with this 2/3 months ago but now he is more fidgety and teething) so I'm thinking of adding more pacifiers and loveys to his sleep space so he can always find and grab something to chew or suck on. 

We still cosleep at night so this is just for naps and bedtime until the first waking when I bring him to bed with me to dream feed and sleep for the rest of the night. 

Is there a different method I can try that will help him be soothed by my presence instead of overestimulated? I don't think he is ready for 2 naps yet. ",2024-11-08 00:08:46

While doing this he was telling my son he was an asshole little fucker, he deserved it, and that he was a pussy. Another parent that was there for pickup (I was not off work yet) pulled the kid off my son. 

After that I demanded the kid be removed from the after school program.

I want this kid gone, it's not his first offense ( he touched a girls butt and when she told on him he threw a chair at her) and there have been other instances with other kids. 

Mr husband says we should give him a second chance, to put ourselves in the parents shoes and imagine what we would want in that situation.

I want the kid gone and under a lot of mental health services.

My son (13M) has a close friend, “Jake,” who he’s known for a couple of years. Lately, I’ve noticed my son becoming a bit more distant and anxious, especially when it comes to talking about this friend. I finally sat him down to ask what was going on, and after some pushing, he admitted that Jake has been taking things from his room – small things, like money, snacks, and even some of his toys, when my son isn’t looking. Apparently, Jake says things like, “It’s just a joke” or “I’ll give it back later,” but my son is feeling really uncomfortable with it.

I asked my son why he didn’t say anything sooner, and he said he was afraid of making Jake mad and losing their friendship. He kept saying, “I don’t want to be a snitch,” which just broke my heart because I can tell he’s stuck in this situation. He doesn’t want to hurt the friendship, but at the same time, he knows it’s wrong.

I’ve talked to my son about the importance of standing up for himself and not letting anyone take advantage of him, but I don’t know how to approach Jake or his parents. I don’t want to make things awkward between the kids, but I also can’t just let this slide. It’s not just the stolen things – I think it’s also affecting my son’s confidence, and I don’t want him feeling like he’s in a toxic friendship but doesn’t know how to get out of it.

Has anyone been in a situation like this before? How do I address this with Jake’s parents without making it a bigger issue than it already is? I’m feeling really unsure of how to handle it, and I’m worried about my son’s emotional well-being through all this.

Week 1: gather information for 6 categories. Must answer all bullet points for each category (4-7 per category). 

Week 2: practice writing facts gathered during week 1.

Week 3: copy writing from practice report onto final report. Draw pictures for each of the 6 categories, including a cover page picture of the animal with background and a life cycle diagram. Fill out separate sheet with all sources used.

I'm exhausted. Here is some insight to our usual morning. Two kids 9m, 12f and myself. We have 1 bathroom and the kids share a bedroom ( hoping to move soon for more space) I set my alarm for 6:10 am, I try to not hit snooze but I'm only human. I try to be done myself in the shower by 6:30. Usually I wake up the kids before I jump in the shower.  The goal is to be out the door by 715/7:20.

Usually, my son is ok, sometimes there are rough mornings where he's dragging his feet, whining etc but he can get ready in about 20 min. 

I do try to keep the kids separate so they have some privacy. One is in the bathroom while one is in the bedroom getting dressed. But I also need to get ready for work. I work in an appointment based job so being late for work is frowned upon.

My daughter is the issue. I get it I was 12 once, it's hard. She cares a lot about what others think so she is constantly worried about zits, make up, hair and clothes. The hormones are raging and most morning she's crying about something - and I'm not exaggerating full blow panic/tears/sobbing. I can't take it anymore. I try to give tips. Getting up earlier, getting clothes ready before bed, how to streamline her make up ( which isn't a lot - Usually some concealer and mascara) these huge feelings slow us down a lot. 

I hate hearing myself tell her to calm down and get a grip but I can't continue to run this behind to get her to school and her brother to daycare, my patience is running thin.

 I'm trying to teach her accountability and time management - but I'm just a dumb mom that knows nothing. Leaving without her isn't an option and throwing her over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes while she cries and mascara runs down her face won't work either. 

I feel like I'm in a lose/lose situation and need to get everyone up way earlier - which also won't go over well. I'm also exhausted and feeling overwhelmed.

Ever since they are inseparable. His girlfriend changed colleges at the last minute because she did not want the separation. It has been a disaster. They live in the same dorm on the same floor! My son has always had good grades and has worked hard to get into college. His midterm grades are not good. Girlfriend has awful grades and withdrew last week. 
Now my son wants to withdraw and do online classes next semester so they can be together. He wants to live in her Moms house. 
I am livid over all of this. I feel he is really messing up and I have voiced my opinion. I do not want him living with her. I fear she is going to end up pregnant and he will be stuck in a small town where there are no jobs and no future. He has such big dreams. What can I do?",2024-11-06 21:52:29

One day it’s, “Mom, if I don’t get 10,000 followers, I’ll be a nobody!” and the next, it’s, “Dad, why can’t I just game all night like *that* kid?”

Now we’re not just competing with the playground chatter; we’re up against a never-ending stream of “cool people” with perfect lives (or at least that’s what they show) teaching our kids what “success” and “normal” look like. How are you all handling this? Do we block the apps? Limit screen time? Give the speech on how “real life isn’t like social media” for the 200th time?

I just want my kids to grow up feeling good about who they are without thinking they need to mimic every trend or “life hack” from someone who’s barely old enough to vote.

My daughter (6F) is in 1st grade at a school that is in our neighborhood. Once school is out we’ll stay at the school’s playground so she can play with some of her friends and then we’ll walk home. Our neighbor (7M) happens to be in her class and they’re best friends. I talk to his mom everyday, we walk home from school together, play dates, it’s an everyday friendship. As I was just putting her to bed she told me that our neighbor and another boy in her class showed their penises to her on the playground today after school. That other boy was also shouting vagina to her over and over before flashing her. Apparently he did it first and our neighbor boy followed suit. I texted his mom not too long ago to tell her what my daughter said and I haven’t heard back (it’s also 11pm here currently). My biggest question is, should I approach the school about this? It did happen after school on the school premises. I’m concerned that if that’s going on then it could happen during school and to other kids. I’m going to message their teacher in the morning because I did tell my daughter to avoid that boy I just don’t know how much to divulge. What would you do? Has anyone dealt with this?

My daughter (15F) has started refusing to eat anything we prepare at home. She used to eat dinner with us every night, and while she was always a bit of a picky eater, it was never an issue. But over the past couple of months, she’s barely touched her meals at home. I’ve tried cooking her favorite foods, asking her what she’d like to eat, but nothing works. She’ll just say she’s “not hungry” and then end up eating something quick or processed later on when no one’s watching.

At first, I thought it was a phase – teens go through all kinds of strange preferences, right? But now I’m worried there might be more to it. I’ve tried gently asking her if there’s something about our food she doesn’t like or if she’s feeling okay, but she shuts down and just says she “doesn’t want to talk about it.” It’s like there’s this invisible wall now, and every time I try to address it, she becomes defensive and avoids the conversation altogether.

I’m honestly starting to wonder if there’s an underlying issue, like maybe she’s struggling with body image or food anxiety, but she won’t open up, and I don’t want to push too hard. I don’t want her to feel cornered or embarrassed about it, but at the same time, I’m genuinely worried. She’s getting skinnier, and I can’t just ignore that.

Has anyone else dealt with this type of situation? Should I be concerned or give her space to figure things out? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to approach this without making her feel pressured or uncomfortable. I just want her to be healthy and feel comfortable eating around us again, but I don’t know how to get there.

Any support or experiences would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance.",2024-11-08 00:35:00

parenting,1glxi8u,Three year old and emotional behaviors,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1glxi8u/three_year_old_and_emotional_behaviors/,3,"Hey guys! This is my first kid. He’s a three year old boy. My literal only experience with kids before him was being one myself 😭 My kid has issues focusing. Like looking me in the eyes. And listening to instruction. He’s not like that with everyone idk if he is dealing with something that’s making him scared to look me in my eyes??? Which makes me terribly sad but I don’t make a big deal out of it I just let him do whatever he wants in that regard. I think he’s dealing with emotional issues but I’m not sure because I don’t have much to compare to. So, I have been working with him to listen to his teacher at daycare. We go over it after I pick him up (congratulate him if he did good, tell him it’s okay we will do better tomorrow if he struggles that day and then I move on to “fun” convo like what was his favorite part of daycare) and in the mornings before I drop him off I reiterate  expectations- being kind, respectful, listening, no hitting.

When I picked my kid up from daycare yesterday he had had a good day. We did a celebratory dance in the parking lot, high fived, got in the car. I told him I was proud of him and I knew he could do it! And I asked him what his favorite part of daycare was. He told me Dinos and goldfish and then he is REALLY upset like whinj g crying upset because he didn’t get to see a bus when we were leaving (this isn’t like a normal thing or anything, we don’t see busses with any consistency he has no reason to believe seeing a bus is a part of our routine therefore he feels like he’s missing out) I will say ever since he knew how to name different 
Modes of transportation he will say “mommy, look a truck!” (Or bus, or tractor, or crane) and I will say “Hi, truck!!!!” And he will too. And I’m like buddy what are you talking about? We can look for a bus on the way home no big deal. Nope there isn’t a bus right here but that’s okay.

And he’s upset and I’m like buddy wants going on? We had a good day, you were fine why are you so sad? And he tells me because you yelled at me???? (I didn’t yell!!!) and I say dude I didn’t yell??? I am so happy to see you you were happy what’s happening right now? And then he tells me someone at daycare bit him. (This isn’t true, the daycare does incident reports and he sometimes cries and makes reasons up) and I’m trying to figure out, why my son cries or is upset when I think everything’s normal. And then he just lists random reasons why he’s not happy. I’m very lost- there isn’t credibility to the things he’s saying I’m not trying to be dismissive but it’s like reaching for weird reasons why he’s upset. 


My son says sometimes “mommy my stomach hurts I think we need to go to the doctor so I can feel better” after a few times of checking his temp, calling daycare asking if he ate anything or complained of feeling bad, I figured out that it’s something random that he’s saying and feeling. I read that child emotional issues can sometimes manifest as kids stomach randomly hurting. 


I don’t understand the random sad outbursts and I don’t know how to help. I do think he’s going through something and I want to help him efficiently. Thanks for everyone who took the time to read and who will respond ",2024-11-07 18:34:18

parenting,1glqgm9,Worried about my 11 yo's mental health,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1glqgm9/worried_about_my_11_yos_mental_health/,9,"Backstory, my (39F) husband (41M) and I are in the middle of an ugly separation/divorce. (It started January 2023 so it's been a while) We have 3 kids (14F, 11F, 9F). They have all handled things differently.

14 YO sees the toxicity of the marriage and feels better off that we are apart now. She has a very good relationship with me and is fierce as hell and super tough so when her dad acts like an idiot she will call him out on it. They hash it out, she says how she feels and puts him in his place and they move on. I think she just has realistic expectations for him, which is that she takes whatever he has to give but expects nothing.

9 YO is extremely emotional and volatile. She has HUGE emotions that she freely shows to anyone in her proximity. She's the kid who cries, who rages, who throws things and storms around the house like a hurricane of emotion, but she gets it OUT. She says how she feels. She never holds back. She expresses so articulately when she is hurt or angry. She's very good at expressing all of her feelings. She is very close to her dad and when his actions hurt her she tells him, but she's also open to listening to his ""reasons"" she typically doesn't LIKE them but she understands them and I think it gives her some sort of peace

Both of these girls have gone to therapy for extended periods of time.

Now the middle gal. The 11 YO. She had the most gutteral reaction to our announcement of the divorce. She sobbed harder than anyone. She BEGGED us not to do it. Then she just got quiet. She acted like she was fine. She never talks about her feelings. She outright REFUSED to go to therapy. (We tried a few sessions and the therapist felt it would be more harmful to her to make her go at this because she was so upset over the idea of it and absolutely refused to participate.)

I spend a lot of time with her. I make one on one time for her. I am an open book with my kids (within reason) I have done everything I know how to do, to let her know I am a safe space for her.

Last week their dad decided to openly get rid of some items relating to our past, by burning them in our back yard while we weren't home. I have tried hard to shield the kids from his nonsense b/c I don't want to hurt them, but that has created a lot of situations where I'm left picking up their little broken hearts and making excuses for him.

I have been encouraged to stop doing this because it's so bad for my own mental health. I never talk disparagingly about him, but I have been told by counselors and therapists and friends and family etc. (everyone) to stop covering for him and making excuses for him.

So this time around when they asked me I told them the truth.

Everyone was incredibly upset. He did not try to console or comfort them, he just told them that it was his way of healing and he didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. This was not an adequate answer for any of them but the oldest and youngest both confronted him when they next saw him, and they worked stuff out. Again, nobody is happy about it but they were able to express their feelings.

Middle didn't say a word. And her dad didn't make any effort to talk to her about it.

Sidenote, she spends a LOT of time alone in her room now. She used to be very active but has gradually become very lethargic and will choose to be alone in her room on her iPad rather than out with her friends. (not all the time but more than she used to) she will choose to take naps. She's clearly very very tired.

She's also 11 and starting puberty so it's hard to tell what is what.

She has gained a lot of weight. At the pediatrician yesterday her growth chart for weight shot from 50% to.... much higher when she's been a steady line her whole life.

So I have been concerned. Last night I found texts to her best friend on her iPad which read (and this is an exact quote)

""I am so sad. I know I hide it so nobody knows but It's all the time I feel this way. It's hard living with all this. It's weird. It's like a feeling that never ends. Even in happy moments, you feel depressed. Like I got sad. My dad was gone. He couldn't sing me happy birthday like normal. I'm sad all the time and I'm tired of it. It drains my energy. I cannot control it. It's this anger and this rage and when you are done raging you get a deep deep state of depression and sorrow. That's what it feels like.""

She has never expressed any of this to me and I have tried so many times to help facilitate being a safe space for her to open up to. I don't know what to do. I'm so worried about her. She is clearly really suffering but she hides it so well.

I don't know if this was a dramatic series of messages to her friend immediately following the traumatic event of her dad burning stuff last week, or if this is actually something she's truly dealing with all the time. I feel inclined to believe that she's dealing with it to some extent all the time.

I don't know what to do. Do I force her back into therapy? I plan to take her out just the two of us today to go to Starbucks and just have some time to talk. My heart is so incredibly broken and I'm so scared. She is the most beautiful, talented, funny, amazing child. She is creative, good at EVERYTHING she tries to do. She's athletic, strong, makes straight A's. Is liked by everyone. She's an incredible person and I am terrified I have ruined her life with this divorce and I'm afraid for her mental health and her safety.

I need guidance. I don't know what to do.",2024-11-07 13:30:20

And not because he understands anything about politics, of course—he’s four! No, it’s because he thinks Trump “looks funny” and does “silly dances.” Apparently, whenever Trump pops up on TV, my kid lights up and laughs like it’s a cartoon.

It all started when he saw a clip of Trump doing one of those stiff dance moves at a rally, and now he can’t stop mimicking it around the house. I even caught him trying to do the “funny dance” in front of his friends. I can’t believe this is happening in my own home.

I’ve tried explaining, in the gentlest way I can, that Trump isn’t exactly someone we look up to. But to a four-year-old, it’s all “funny man on TV!” Now after the election this has become a huge problem. I'm completely crushed by the result, and my son is basically celebrating every time he sees Trump's face. It is causing me to resent my own son. I know he doesn't mean anything bad, but I can't just accept my fate as the parent of a tiny Trump fan.

So here I am, confessing this because I have no idea how to handle it. Should I just let him grow out of it? Or will he end up chanting “Make America Great Again” before he hits school? I’m genuinely worried this will lead to more, that he’ll get drawn into that kind of thinking.

There is no simple solution to this. I’ve tried turning off the TV, but Trump is *everywhere*. His orange face seems to pop up in every corner of media—you can’t escape him. Even when we’re out in public, people are talking about him all the time. It’s like he’s haunting us, and I can’t shield my son from it, no matter how hard I try.

I even took away his iPad time, since all he wanted to do was watch videos of “the funny orange man dancing.” But even without screens, it’s as if Trump is everywhere. I feel completely defeated trying to keep my son from idolizing him. Please help, before my son turns into a MAGA-cultist.",2024-11-08 16:17:06

I’ve been a part of their life for years, since they were really little, so I have been able to create a very close bond with them. I’ve never had any issues with them and they’ve welcomed me like I was part of the family from day one. 
The four (five in a few days) year old has been horrible for the past few months and we are at a loss on what to do. The boy’s have split custody with their mother but spend about 80% of their time, everyday except for Monday and part of Tuesday, here. First it was potty training, he still doesn’t poop on the potty without being told. He would hold it and it created medical problems that now he is on daily laxatives. Starting young fives helped him but it is still a daily battle to this day. 
Now, he has had horrible attitude problems. He will scream, throw things, cry, etc. when he doesn’t get exactly his way when he’s here. He’s even peed all over the floor. Today, I told him to clean his room as I couldn’t step foot in there without running into Magna-Tiles, cars, Tinker Toys, and everything else he has in there. He started screaming and crying, telling me he didn’t want to clean his room. I told him if he continued to throw a fit, he would lose his tv for the rest of the day and night (both boy’s have one in their rooms). That is the moment he punched me. I’ll admit I lost my temper in a moment where I should not have and yelled at him but I was caught off guard. This child scared me as he threw his toys at me, screaming and crying even louder. He had no remorse as I told him it was never okay to hit people and just continued yelling over me. I sent him straight to bed and went downstairs and cried. 
With his behavior I feel like we’ve tried everything - positive and negative. I know this is some times a phase children go through at around his age but his older brother was never like this. I don’t have children of my own either. We are discussing possible solutions in terms of therapy or doctors. The only thing is, he’s still so young and it could be something professionals tell us he will grow out of. Also, we would need the support of their mother but she has been unwilling to in the past and has brushed off almost everything we’ve brought up. We were the ones to bring him to a doctor for the bowel issues and we’re the only ones that give him his medicine, etc. I’m not necessarily posting this for advice because we will need to get him whatever help he needs regardless of other factors but has anyone else experienced this? I’ve never been scared of his behavior but when he punched me and threw his things at me, it made me feel a way I haven’t before.   ",2024-11-07 22:32:10

Today we were out for a short walk, it wasn’t sunny at all with thick cloud cover, so we let our guard down. In the evening, I noticed my baby’s cheeks, back of neck, and back of arms were slightly red/pink, and some flaking on his checks, so probably mild sunburn. I feel so shitty about it because it was so preventable, but we rarely ever have to think about this where we live! Especially having read stuff about raised skin cancer risk with even a single sunburn in childhood.

So this got me thinking, how do babies in the south not get burned all the time? Are parents just keeping them indoors, making them wear full long sleeves in hot weather, or applying thick layers of sunscreen daily?!?

I have some concerns regarding B’s development.
Im not sure if my concerns are from the fact that A has just always been ahead of his age by all means, and thats whats making me constantly compare the two.
Im not referring to the fact that A started walking and talking earlier, but communication with him in terms of reasoning and logic has always been different. A has always been super smart, super social, he would pick up on things from the first time i’d teach him. Linguistically, he would pick up on words without us teaching him how to say them (just from listening to us use those words).

When i look at videos of him when he was younger, he was generally more capable than B across the board (even when he was younger than B)

B’s temperament is completely different. He is a difficult child by all means and requires constant attention and no one adult can handle him for a prolonger period. He makes sounds here and there, still doesn’t know how to use words to their actual meaning. He does make eye contact, responds to his name, crawls and stands. He doesn’t walk unassisted, even though I’m sure he can if he tries, but he’s just too clingy to us and wants to constantly be held. He is very attracted (obsessively) to objects like remotes. He is extremely hyper and cannot sit still in an adult’s lap. He uses all his force to twist around and constantly change positions when we’re holding him. His hyper activity is something worth noting as it makes him so difficult to handle, he honestly just wears out my shoulders after some time.

 A used to sleep much better than B when he was his age. The first 8 months of B’s life were a nightmare sleep wise, he would literally wake up screaming and crying multiple times a night. When and if he focuses on something, we cannot distract him from it what so ever. He does not like watching TV at all (opposite to A who loves the TV). B cannot just sit and watch something for more than a minute. 

He responds when we tell him ‘no’ by pausing whatever he’s doing. He doesn’t know how to properly play with things, he pretty much just puts objects in his mouth and clings on to them with his hands.

We have a 4 year old son 'Ty', and at home, we all watch a lot of hockey and UFC events, and Ty and J come to my games all the time and cheer for me.

Ty is a very energetic little kid, and we've gotten a few comments from his teacher ""Mrs F"" a few times about him being too loud or talking too much in class. A few times, she's mentioned that he talks a lot about sports, and here and there has said that it's ""disruptive""

She's also complained that he talks a lot about hockey fights and UFC, and that she ""worries"" it would be 'Disruptive"" or ""encourage violence"" amongst his classmates. His dad and I laughed it all off, as Ty is not violent in the slightest, and is pretty popular with his classmates. He would never lift a finger against another person, just we all love watching hockey and discussing the best fights, plays, etc.

Ty wants to try hockey for himself and for the last few months has been attending a skating class. Recently, we ordered him his own gear and when it arrived we took him to a sticktime session.

He LOVED it and had such a great time starting to learn stick handling, and was so excited to ""shoot on mommy"" (I'm a goalie).

Yesterday J and I get a call from Mrs. F saying she gave Ty a detention for ""roughousing"" and ""violent language"", and she wants us to come in for a meeting to speak further, saying that she has ""concerns' about the sports in our family and what's best for Ty and that she ""worries"" that hockey may not be the best for him.

J and I spoke to Ty.... Apparently he was so excited about learning to play hockey that he was showing some of his friends skating posture and how to hold a stick, and they were playing around pretending to be hockey players. Apparently there was some light pushing and shoving, but nobody was anywhere near injured and it was not ""rough"" (Ty said he was just showing them the stance and how to shoot, and they were joking around doing a play game, and he and his friends were pretending to body check each other, but no contact or injuries or anything).  
Apparently Mrs F saw part of it out the window, and came outside to come stop it (even though accorting to Ty AND his friend Sara, there were other teachers and parents outside during recess who also saw and apparently didn't try to stop it)

To me it sounds ridiculous and like it was some harmless playing, and Ty is SO excited to start hockey and join Mites in the next few years. J and I are trying to figure out how to handle this any thoughts appreciated.

I looked into it after witnessing some picky eating in the extended family and watching people at family gatherings standing over the child demanding just-one-more-bite and I thought, I can't do that, there has to be a better way.

I'm curious to hear from anyone who saw it through and what the long term results were? My daughter went from very particular at age 2-3, to eating a reasonably broad range of food, however when confronted with a new dish her 'try' will be one mouthful or less and it can take a long time to bring her onboard with a new dish (which I am still assuming is pretty normal). She went to a friend's house for dinner the other night and when I picked her up, all she'd eaten was potato. The food was really plain, chicken with some sides, all veggies and foods she knows and eats but prepared slightly differently. She hadn't touched it. There were 4 other kids there tucking into everything and more. 

My 5 year old is the one who I'm really struggling with. He doesn't eat meat (or meat alternatives), but will eat fish and eggs. The only veggies he eats are carrot and cucumber. I have been doing division of responsibility but then he was diagnosed with an iron deficiency. I upped the amount of meat we were eating but he just won't eat it - I have literally googled every method and tried every way of serving it - meat sauces, burgers, tiny meatballs with toothpicks, you name it. He is now starting to drop the fish so he's only on eggs. We had him on iron supplements for 3 months a year or so ago, but they kill your gut bacteria and I'm just really wanting to sort his eating out to bring his iron up naturally. I don't think it's a sensory issue because he ate all sorts when he was younger. He loves cooking and gets involved with making dinner, we let him choose veggies at the shop, but when it comes to it he rejects everything and basically lives on pasta with cheese or scrambled eggs. 

Basically I'm just wondering if anyone had similar and stuck with devision of responsibility with any luck, or whether anyone eventually tried other methods that worked? Thank you!!",2024-11-07 19:47:25

He had a great time at school in September, since Oct hit in being called every other day, he’s having massive melt downs, running on to the street, destroying the class.

He’s been waking up every night for at least an hour to an hour and a half just sitting there, I ask why he says he had a nightmare. When watching YouTube, he watches those gamers stream a video game and talk, I thought it was harmless. On his tablet he only has YouTube kids so I thought it’s regulated and no inappropriate things are on there. Of course I was wrong, I deleted YouTube off his tablet, and today I came home from school drop off and opened Roblox only to see a game he was last playing, of these creepy looking creatures that you simply throw into a grinder and kill? no wonder he’s having nightmares and talking about death, he’s so into horror things lately and I truly believe this is why his behaviour is the way it is, he has such a mix of great days and horrible days, his anger has gotten COMPLETELY out of control. I’ve since deleted every game off his tablet except for educational games like khan academy. He will be coming home everyday and doing homework and possibly watching a movie as a family. Netflix doesn’t seem to bother him and never has, he could care less about it. This boy will never have YouTube again, or games on his tablet.

My (43m) son (7m) is in second grade and is small for his age. Almost 30 lbs but on the cusp. He is fed well though he can be picky at times. He’s also around 43” tall. His 4 year old sister is only around 3-4 inches shorter which I am already dreading if she surpasses his height. My wife is 5’3” and I am 5’9”, so of course we aren’t expecting a giant. 

I love him so much it breaks my heart to hear him tell me some things kids say at school even if it’s just he’s “the smallest” kid. He is in 2nd grade and is excelling in academics especially reading. What crushes me though is when he tells me he feels small at school and feels normal at home, his friends from preschool sometimes towering over him now, buying 5T clothes for him, and just today coming home from a birthday party with laser tag saying he got “shot” twice because he’s too small. 

It’s tough to navigate and figure out what to say. Of course we love him no matter the size he is or becomes, I just don’t know if there is any advice out there that has helped the self esteem of other smaller kids that could help? I want him to be confident in the body he has and know that his heart and mind are immeasurably giant.

Never. I truly feel like every baby is such a blessing and who could ever be upset about the gender? Me. Apparently me. We have a daughter, who we ADORE. She is our whole life, our whole world. Me and my husband love being girl parents, we would have been completely happy with 2-3 girls and just thrived in it. For me, I also have a little bit of might I say “trauma” around boy moms? My mother in law being reason number 1, literally accused me of cheating because I was taking her baby boy away and changing him and just about every other monster in law story you can think of is something I have experienced with her(thankfully, things are better now. Mostly) the relationship on her and with my husband, turned borderline sexual and just crazy. She was in love with him, and I was the woman ruining her life for it. Reason number 2 being my mom having clear favorites for my brothers, who touched me inappropriately(butt smacking, but lingering and grossly) and in the many fights I started because I was uncomfortable and felt so icky about it, my moms response was “it’s play in this house, they aren’t doing nothing wrong”.

I know that I can raise a good boy. I know in my bones that I can do a good job and raise a strong and gentle man who loves and respects others. I just have such a hard time wanting to. I don’t want to handle their sexual awakenings, I don’t want to handle the natural anger, I don’t want the responsibility of possibly raising someone who hurts other women. Maybe I need to go to therapy for this, but I’m really scared. 

If you have boys, and love it. Please share. I could really use some good stories and experiences to help me change my mindset and have better associations with having a boy. 


Edit 1: because I am seeing some pretty nasty stuff insinuated about my husband. Once my husband realized it was so bad he put a swift stop to it. His mom was in love with him, and it was his first time navigating that sort of thing. We went no contact for months. Missed holidays. Didn’t answer phone calls and texts. He was totally disgusted by the reality of the situation and was icked out completely. My husband didn’t allow anything, and has since put up amazing and healthy boundaries to prevent the behavior. We were young when we got married, and we can a very, very long way. My mother in law knows her place now, and has worked on her marriage as well. Also some comments that are just rude, I do understand. Thankfully Reddit is the one place you can be honest and ask the questions some people think it crazy. I have gotten so many incredibly nice comments, thank you guys🧡

Edit 2: I don’t know why this was locked, but now that I’ve read more of here is a lot of nice, but also a lot of honestly so rude comments. I am a mom who does care deeply. I am actively resolving this issue right this second. I think that it’s okay to be sad and to trace back my issues to the bad experiences I had. It obviously is trauma, that I’ve worked through before, but manifesting in a completely different way. I do understand thinking it’s crazy because you haven’t experienced what I have. But some of these comments are genuinely mean. ",2024-10-12 04:33:39

The guidance has been profoundly helpful and sincerely appreciated. I acknowledge the consensus that I exhibit excessive sensitivity and require personal growth. As such, I plan to address these concerns during my upcoming therapy session. Additionally, I recognize that my initial post unintentionally conveyed self-pity and made the discussion overly personal.  I will ensure that parenting decisions prioritize my daughter's needs. The issue of controlling behavior was also raised, which stems from my struggle to let go of the memories of my daughter's unconditional affection during childhood.  She would often go up to me for no reason and tell me she loves me. But I know she's now growing up and I must accept it. However, I will adopt the recommended strategy of asking how I can support my daughter rather than directly inquiring about her self-care. I am committed to becoming a more effective and nurturing parent. Thank you all.]







As a parent, I'm deeply troubled by my daughter's hurtful behavior, particularly at 13. While I avoid criticizing those I love, her actions are eroding my well-being. Yesterday's incident, where she derisively responded to my comment about my shirt and later apologized, only to repeat similar behavior today, has left me heartbroken. After I told her about the shirt I was wearing she said, ""Let me pull out of my pocket the amount of fucks I give"". Just today,  her dismissive response to my offer to help with her hair was equally upsetting. I said to her, ""did you take a shower?"" She said, ""yes"". I said, it doesn't look like your hair has been brushed"".  She said, ""yeah, what you going to do about it?"".  I said, ""well, I can help you gently brush your hair"".  She said, ""the only one that touches my hair is me"".  These recurring incidents make me feel unworthy and unloved. I'm struggling to understand why she continues to hurt me and where I failed as a parent. I feel hopeless and sometimes I just want to give up💔. Any advice is appreciated. ",2024-10-04 21:24:43
parenting,1fuqixc,I think my son is gay…,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1fuqixc/i_think_my_son_is_gay/,11,"So this is my first Reddit post. I’ll try to keep it short. So I have two sons (12 and 14) and an amazing wife. My elder son has always had an extroverted personality since he could barely walk and loved to sing and dance and be in front of the camera. A natural entertainer! He never had any interest in sports or any of the things boys normally gravitate towards. And since he was little, all of his best friends were girls which is still the case to this day. He is not really feminine in his mannerisms, but most of his interests are much more aligned to what girls would normally like. 

So I have a strong feeling that he could be gay.  I don’t want this to come off as me sounding homophobic, but I worry about this. Not because I have anything against gay people. In fact, some of my best friends are gay and they are amazing. I worry more because, I feel that being gay makes life tougher in general. The world is still stuck in the old ages in many places where gays have less rights, and are discriminated against. Even in western society I feel that it is still not fully accepted and there is some hidden bias. The other worry I have is that I grew up in a pretty macho family and that my son might feel like he is disappointing me if he ever came out as gay. And that would devastate me as I would not care at all and just want him to be happy and be his true self. I would want him to come out as soon as he is comfortable with himself. Again, he might not be gay but many signs point there and it is clearly on my mind.

Do any parents here have any experience with a gay son where they had suspicions from an early age. Do you just let them be and see what happens? Should I broach the subject with him? Am I worrying for no reason? I have so many questions. Would love some advice.",2024-10-02 20:42:50

I’m 25M and have a son 11M, 
I will admit we aren’t the most stable family but in no way is he being abused/neglected. 


I got home from work on Wednesday and got a knock at my door, it was some lady saying that cps had received a call of potential “child endangerment” and if she could ask a few questions. 

Well, today I march into school with my son because what the fuck. The reasons they gave were

1 - he didn’t have healthy lunches

2 - he walked to/from school by himself 

3 - he said I would be mad if he failed his upcoming test. 

4 - some minor behaviour issues 



My son packs his own lunch, usually a sandwich with some snacks, obviously not the healthiest but he honestly doesn’t eat anything all day if I pack it. 
He literally live less then a 5 minute walk from his school, and he’s 11. Of course there are dangers of a kid walking alone but they are acting as if I’m forcing him to walk through dark alleyways. 


I guess the final straw for them was when my son said I would be mad over a failed test. But what parent wouldn’t? It’s not like I yell at him but of course I’d be mad if my son was failing. 


I understand that school staff are just trying to lookout for the children’s safety but they are blowing this way out of proportion and I hate this. ",2024-09-19 21:58:38

As my son fell and hit the back of his head, the teacher was on top of him, allowing the other student to kick him in the head. My son is now complaining of a headache and neck pain. The incident was recorded on video, clearly showing that my son did not start the fight or touch the other student, although he was trying to protect himself. After being kicked, my son reacted angrily and said he wanted to stab the other student with a pencil. Now, he has been expelled for making criminal threats, and the police were involved. He is awaiting placement in a new school. I took him to the ER, where he was diagnosed with a mild head injury that needs monitoring. While my son’s reaction was wrong, he did not provoke the fight.

They said that ""removal is curative"" for his type of tumor, the majority of the time. 

Well, we just got word after a follow-up MRI that there's some regrowth, and the most likely outcome (we find out more on Monday) is that he'll need to have brain surgery again to remove the regrowth, and then a year of chemo. He'll have a port put in, and then mostly be stuck at home for a year...

I (34M) am stunned. My wife can barely keep it together. He has been doing so good since surgery. Just a normal, happy kid, and the light of our lives. I knew this was a possibility, but the news today hit me like a sledgehammer. The surgery is a sprint, and the chemo will be a marathon.

Anyone else that's been through this with a little one - how do you manage?

You may all just be 'internet strangers', but there are thousands of you. Reading. Commenting. Just letting me know you're here, with an upvote. Holding my son in your prayers. Promising me you will never forget. Sharing some of your own struggles, to let me know that there will come a day when it's not just all dark, anymore. 

Unless you have been where I am, right now, you have no idea. No idea how much this helps. Even if all you can say is that you're sorry, despite none of this being your fault. 

I am disheartened by the fact that a few people have suggested I might be 'karma farming'. To those who think that is what's happening here, I say: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever happened to you to make you that cynical. I hope you have people in your life who can and will take care of you. Because you need it.   

***

You were the best thing that had ever happened to me. My perfect little boy. You were the sun; the center of my universe.

You were confident and full of joy. You were headstrong, like your mother. You were picking up a step stool, and dragging it to where your bottle was sitting on the counter, before you'd even learned to stand up straight without support. You were walking like a pro by the time you'd turned ten months old. You escaped from daycare not even six months later, walking home down the street, and interrupting our downstairs neighbor's work-from-home day because his was the only bell button that was low enough on the wall for you to reach. That day, you told your daddy that you didn't want to stay with ""all those little kids"", anymore. It was as if you knew how little time you had. 

You'd had really bad respiratory infections with long hospitalizations before. But after that day, when you came home from daycare all on your own, the horror *really* started. You got a yeast infection in your lungs not too long after that. Yes, apparently that happens. It made all sorts of alarm bells go off on the part of your medical team, and three months later, with lots of genetic testing, we found out you had a primary immune deficiency. It only got worse from there. You were in and out of the hospital with various difficult-to-treat infections for the better part of the next two years. We were told three or four times, on different occasions, that you 'might not make it through the night'. Your father left us after the second time, and then again after the third. It was 'too heavy of a burden to bear', he 'hadn't planned for this'. 

We celebrated your second and third birthdays on the ward, and in-between, we went from weekly intravenous immunoglobulin drips, to long-term preventative hospitalization, to bone marrow transplant. After a long search, because you came from Ashkenazi Jews on your father's side, and apparently that makes for a rare tissue type, the transplant happened a few days before you turned three, in August.

You were genuinely better for a while, after that. With help from your grandmother as I tentatively went back to work, I even managed to send you to preschool two days a week for a stretch. You started after Halloween, and you enjoyed it. You used to get up on your school days and say ""yay, I get to go to school today, mama!"" You especially liked it when I would let you ride your bicycle to school. Miraculously, given your medical history, you were the only one there who didn't need training wheels, and you made full use of the bragging rights that came with that. 

But then, one evening in late May, as I was sitting next to your bed with my hand on your shoulder, waiting for you to fall asleep, suddenly you stopped breathing. Your heart had given out.

I didn't panic. I started CPR. I hit the button on my watch to call an ambulance. It worked. They came. They saved you. But four days later, while being monitored and under treatment at the hospital, your heart stopped again. It had been damaged by the chemotherapy prior to your bone marrow transplant. That, we'd known for a while. But now, something else had damaged it. Something bacterial. The doctor told me with a straight face that ""this was proof that the bone marrow transplant had worked, since it's the kind of infection anyone can get."" 

They brought you back again, and gave you a temporary pacemaker. When that didn't help much, they put you under ""just for a few days"", so as to give your heart some time to rest and heal. Nearly three weeks later, you still hadn't woken up. A meeting was called. A decision was made. You finally woke up on Thursday, June 20. I spent about four perfect hours with you. Despite my fears, you recognized me immediately. We had a conversation. It was about teddy bears. But it became obvious quickly that your heart really wasn't in it, anymore. You could lie there, and say a few words, and that was about it. Anything more strenuous exceeded your capacity. You had woken up, but to what kind of life? They put you back under again. 

You were added to the transplant list that day, but I knew. I knew. Luckily, there aren't all that many four-year-old hearts available for transplant. And even if one did pop up, it was unlikely for you to ever get it. Your lungs were all messed up, from too many infections. You'd had a recent bone marrow transplant, which increased the chances of rejection for any other donor organ to near-unacceptable levels. There was some lingering doubt about your brain function, too, despite those four pefect hours. You were never a good candidate. 

And yet, there came one last flicker of hope on Wednesday, June 26. A heart in transit suddenly became available, when its intended recipient unexpectedly died before it could get to him. I received the call during a meeting at work, and I rushed to your side. But by the time I got there, the flicker of hope was already gone. The heart had been in transit just a tad too long. It wasn't viable anymore.  

And so, tonight, I had to let you go. Forever three years old. You were the sun. The center of my universe. It will be dark forever, now.

Sleep tight, my perfect little boy.                 ",2024-06-30 21:01:02
parenting,1d6em1h,My 11 yo son is surprisingly empathetic. ,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1d6em1h/my_11_yo_son_is_surprisingly_empathetic/,2,"I recently hurt my back and it's very painful and difficult for me to get around. My 11 year old is normally in his own world. We both have adhd so I completely understand how it is to be all over the place and get bored easily.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how empathetic and helpful he has become during my injury. He hasn't left my side and has pretty much moved into the living room with me. If I have to get up, he is right there next to me to assist me with walking and reaching things. It has made my heart so full. I had to take a moment to brag on him. We have two sons. The other one is thirteen and has always been more of the helper but does things more out of duty than empathy and has always been an over achiever. He gets praise for things that are more metric based and his helpfulness. Things seem to come more easily to him. I always knew that my youngest was more emotionally driven but never to this extent. Anyway, I just was surprised to have the overwhelming feeling of maybe we did something right instead of the normal feeling of I haven't done enough. It has been the silver lining during these past few days that have left me feeling pretty bummed and useless. So not only am I here to rave about my kiddos but to let other parents know that when you are exhausted and the kids are everywhere and all over the place, one day life may come to a screaming halt and that's when you truly get a glimpse of the little humans you are helping form and it's amazing.
