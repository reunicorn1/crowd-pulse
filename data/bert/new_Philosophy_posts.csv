#/r/philosophy's Mission

/r/philosophy strives to be a community where everyone, regardless of their background, can come to discuss philosophy. This means that all posts should be primarily philosophical in nature. What do we mean by that?

#What is Philosophy?

As with most disciplines, ""philosophy"" has both a casual and a technical usage. 

In its casual use, ""philosophy"" may refer to nearly any sort of thought or beliefs, and include topics such as religion, mysticism and even science. When someone asks you what ""your philosophy"" is, this is the sort of sense they have in mind; they're asking about your general system of thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.

In its technical use -- the use relevant here at /r/philosophy -- philosophy is a particular area of study which can be broadly grouped into several major areas, including:

* Aesthetics, the study of beauty
* Epistemology, the study of knowledge and belief
* Ethics, the study of what we owe to one another
* Logic, the study of what follows from what
* Metaphysics, the study of the basic nature of existence and reality

as well as various subfields of 'philosophy of X', including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and many others.

Philosophy in the narrower, technical sense that philosophers use and which /r/philosophy is devoted to is defined not only by its subject matter, but by its methodology and attitudes. Something is not philosophical merely because it states some position related to those areas. There must also be an emphasis on *argument* (setting forward reasons for adopting a position) and a willingness to subject arguments to various criticisms.

#What Isn't Philosophy?

As you can see from the above description of philosophy, philosophy often crosses over with other fields of study, including art, mathematics, politics, religion and the sciences. That said, in order to keep this subreddit focused on philosophy we require that all posts be primarily philosophical in nature, and defend a distinctively philosophical thesis. 

As a rule of thumb, something does not count as philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit if:

* It does not address a philosophical topic or area of philosophy
* It may more accurately belong to another area of study (e.g. religion or science)
* No attempt is made to argue for a position's conclusions

Some more specific topics which are popularly misconstrued as philosophical but do *not* meet this definition and thus are not appropriate for this subreddit include:

* Drug experiences (e.g. ""I dropped acid today and experienced the oneness of the universe..."")
* Mysticism (e.g. ""I meditated today and experienced the oneness of the universe..."")
* Politics (e.g. ""This is why everyone should support the Voting Rights Act"")
* Self-help (e.g. ""How can I be a happier person and have more people like me?"")
* Theology (e.g. ""Here's how Catholic theology explains transubstantiation"")

#/r/philosophy's Posting Rules

In order to best serve our mission of fostering a community for discussion of philosophy and philosophical issues, we have the following rules which govern all posts made to /r/philosophy:

###PR1: All posts must be about philosophy.
> To learn more about what is and is not considered philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit, see our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq). Posts must be about philosophy proper, rather than only tangentially connected to philosophy. Exceptions are made only for posts about philosophers with substantive content, e.g. news about the profession, interviews with philosophers.

###PR2: All posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis.
> Posts must not only have a philosophical subject matter, but must also present this subject matter in a developed manner. At a minimum, this includes: stating the problem being addressed; stating the thesis; anticipating some objections to the stated thesis and giving responses to them. These are just the minimum requirements. Posts about well-trod issues (e.g. free will) require more development.

###PR3: Questions belong in /r/askphilosophy.
> /r/philosophy is intended for philosophical material and discussion. Please direct all questions to /r/askphilosophy. Please be sure to [read their rules](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/14o2p7n/welcome_to_raskphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/) before posting your question on /r/askphilosophy.

###PR4: Post titles cannot be questions and must describe the philosophical content of the posted material.
> Post titles cannot contain questions, even if the title of the linked material is a question. This helps keep discussion in the comments on topic and relevant to the linked material. Post titles must describe the philosophical content of the posted material, cannot be unduly provocative, click-baity, unnecessarily long or in all caps.

###PR5: Audio/video links require abstracts.
> All links to either audio or video content require abstracts of the posted material, posted as a comment in the thread. Abstracts should make clear what the linked material is about and what its thesis is. Users are also strongly encouraged to post abstracts for other linked material. [See here for an example of a suitable abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/abstracts).

###PR6: All posts must be in English.
> All posts must be in English. Links to Google Translated versions of posts, translations done via AI or LLM, or posts only containing English subtitles are not allowed. 

###PR7: Links behind paywalls or registration walls are not allowed.
> Posts must not be behind any sort of paywall or registration wall. If the linked material requires signing up to view, even if the account is free, it is not allowed. Google Drive links and link shorteners are not allowed.

###PR8: Meta-posts, products, services, surveys, cross-posts and AMAs require moderator pre-approval.
> The following (not exhaustive) list of items require moderator pre-approval: meta-posts, posts to products, services or surveys, cross-posts to other areas of reddit, AMAs. Please contact the moderators for pre-approval via modmail.

###PR9: Users may submit only one post per day.
> Users may never post more than one post per day. Users must follow all [reddit-wide spam guidelines](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-), in addition to the /r/philosophy [self-promotion guidelines](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/selfpromotion).

###PR10: Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract.
> /r/philosophy is not a mental health subreddit. Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch. If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting /r/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden.

#/r/philosophy's Commenting Rules
In the same way that our posting rules above attempt to promote our mission by governing posts, the following commenting rules attempt to promote /r/philosophy's mission to be a community focused on philosophical discussion.

###CR1: Read/Listen/Watch the Posted Content Before You Reply
> Read/watch/listen the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively. If you have unrelated thoughts or don't wish to read the content, please post your own thread or simply refrain from commenting. Comments which are clearly not in direct response to the posted content may be removed.

###CR2:  Argue Your Position
> Opinions are not valuable here, arguments are! Comments that solely express musings, opinions, beliefs, or assertions without argument may be removed.

###CR3: Be Respectful
> Comments which consist of personal attacks will be removed. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Slurs, racism, and bigotry are absolutely not permitted.

###Miscellaneous Posting and Commenting Guidelines

In addition to the rules above, we have a list of miscellaneous guidelines which users should also be aware of:

* Reposting a post or comment which was removed will be treated as circumventing moderation and result in a permanent ban.
* Posts and comments which flagrantly violate the rules, especially in a trolling manner, will be removed and treated as shitposts, and may result in a ban.
* Once your post has been approved and flaired by a moderator you may not delete it, to preserve a record of its posting.
* No reposts of material posted within the last year.
* No posts of entire books, articles over 50 pages, or podcasts/videos that are longer than 1.5 hours. 
* No posts or comments which contain or link to AI-created or AI-assisted material, including text, audio and visuals.
* Posts which link to material should be posted by submitting a link, rather than making a text post. [Please see here for a guide on how to properly submit links](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/submitlinks).
* Harassing individual moderators or the moderator team will result in a permanent ban and a report to the reddit admins.

#Frequently Asked Questions

Below are some frequently asked questions. If you have other questions, please [contact the moderators via modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/philosophy) (not via private message or chat).

###My post or comment was removed. How can I get an explanation?
Almost all posts/comments which are removed will receive an explanation of their removal. That explanation will generally by /r/philosophy's custom bot, /u/BernardJOrtcutt, and will list the removal reason. Posts which are removed will be notified via a stickied comment; comments which are removed will be notified via a reply. If your post or comment resulted in a ban, the message will be included in the ban message via modmail. If you have further questions, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/philosophy).

###How can I appeal my post or comment removal?
To appeal a removal, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/philosophy) (not via private message or chat). Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible. Reposting removed posts/comments without receiving mod approval will result in a permanent ban.

###How can I appeal my ban?
To appeal a ban, please respond to the modmail informing you of your ban. Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible.

###My comment was removed or I was banned for arguing with someone else, but they started it. Why was I punished and not them?
Someone else breaking the rules does not give you permission to break the rules as well. /r/philosophy does not comment on actions taken on other accounts, but all violations are treated as equitably as possible. 

###I found a post or comment which breaks the rules, but which wasn't removed. How can I help?
If you see a post or comment which you believe breaks the rules, please report it using the report function for the appropriate rule. /r/philosophy's moderators are volunteers, and it is impossible for us to manually review every comment on every thread. We appreciate your help in reporting posts/comments which break the rules.

###My post isn't showing up, but I didn't receive a removal notification. What happened?
Sometimes the AutoMod filter will automatically send posts to a filter for moderator approval, especially from accounts which are new or haven't posted to /r/philosophy before. If your post has not been approved or removed within 24 hours, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/philosophy).

###My post was removed and referred to the Open Discussion Thread. What does this mean?
The Open Discussion Thread (ODT) is /r/philosophy's place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but do not necessarily meet our posting rules (especially PR2). For example, these threads are great places for:

* Arguments that aren't substantive enough to meet PR2
* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. ""who is your favorite philosopher?""
* Philosophical questions

If your post was removed and referred to the ODT, it likely meets PR1 but did not meet PR2, and we encourage you to consider posting it to the ODT to share with others.

###My comment responding to someone else was removed, as well as their comment. What happened?
When /r/philosophy removes a parent comment, it also removes all their child comments in order to help readability and focus on discussion.

###I'm interested in philosophy. Where should I start? What should I read?
As explained above, philosophy is a very broad discipline and thus offering concise advice on where to start is very hard. We recommend reading [this /r/AskPhilosophyFAQ post](https://reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4ifqi3/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start/) which has a great breakdown of various places to start. For further or more specific questions, we recommend posting on /r/askphilosophy.

###Why is your understanding of philosophy so limited?
As explained above, this subreddit is devoted to philosophy as understood and done by philosophers. In order to prevent this subreddit from becoming /r/atheism2, /r/politics2, or /r/science2, we must uphold a strict topicality requirement in PR1. Posts which may touch on philosophical themes but are not distinctively philosophical can be posted to one of reddit's many other subreddits.

###Are there other philosophy subreddits I can check out?
If you are interested in other philosophy subreddits, please see [this list of related subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/sublinks). /r/philosophy shares much of its modteam with its sister-subreddit, /r/askphilosophy, which is devoted to philosophical questions and answers as opposed to discussion. In addition, that list includes more specialized subreddits and more casual subreddits for those looking for a less-regulated forum.

###A thread I wanted to comment in was locked but is still visible. What happened?
When a post becomes unreasonable to moderate due to the amount of rule-breaking comments the thread is locked. /r/philosophy's moderators are volunteers, and we cannot spend hours cleaning up individual threads.

#/r/philosophy's Self-Promotion Policies

/r/philosophy allows self-promotion, but only when it follows our [guidelines on self-promotion](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/selfpromotion).

All self-promotion must adhere to the following self-promotion guidelines, in addition to all of the general subreddit rules above:

* Accounts engaging in self-promotion must register with the moderators and choose a single account to post from, as well as choose a flair to be easily identified. 
* You may not post promote your own content in the comments of other threads, including the Open Discussion Thread.
* All links to your own content must be submitted as linked posts ([see here for more details](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/submitlinks)).
* You may not repost your own content until after 1 year since its last submission, regardless of whether you were the person who originally submitted it.
* You may not use multiple accounts to submit your own content. You may choose to switch to a new account for the purposes of posting your content by [contacting the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy).
* No other account may post your content. All other users' posts of your content will be removed, to avoid doubling up on self-promotion. Directing others to post your material is strictly forbidden and will result in a permanent ban.
* All posts must meet all of our standard [posting rules](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules).

You are responsible for knowing and following these policies, all of which have been implemented to combat spammers taking advantage of /r/philosophy and its users. **If you are found to have violated any of these policies we may take any number of actions, including banning your account or platform either temporarily or permanently.** 

If you have any questions about the self-promotion policies, including whether a particular post would be acceptable, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) before submission.

###How Do I Register for Self-Promotion?

If you intend to promote your own content on /r/philosophy, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) with the subject 'Self-Promotion Registration', including all of the following:

* A link to your relevant platforms (e.g. Substack, YouTube)
* A confirmation of which single account you are going to use on /r/philosophy 
* A short name we can use to flair your posts to identify you as the poster 
* A confirmation that you do not use any form of AI or LLM to create or assist in the creation of any of your content, including audio, visual, text and translation
* A confirmation that you have read and agree to abide by the [general subreddit rules and guidelines](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1d5uo4r/welcome_to_rphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/?)
* A confirmation that you have read and agree to abide by the [self-promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/selfpromotion)

**Only accounts which have had their self-promotion registration approved by the moderators are allowed to self-promote on /r/philosophy.** Acknowledgement of receipt of registration and approval may take up to two weeks on average; if you have not received an approval or rejection after two weeks you may respond to the original message and ask for an update. **Engaging in self-promotion prior to your registration being approved may result in a ban.**

#A Note about Moderation

/r/philosophy is moderated by a team of dedicated volunteer moderators who have spent years attempting to build the best philosophy Q&A platform on the internet. Unfortunately, the reddit admins have repeatedly made changes to this website which have made moderating subreddits harder and harder. In particular, reddit has recently announced that it will begin charging for access to API (Application Programming Interface, essentially the communication between reddit and other sites/apps). While this may be, in isolation, a reasonable business operation, the timeline and pricing of API access has threatened to put nearly all third-party apps, e.g. Apollo and RIF, out of business. You can read more about the history of this change [here](https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) or [here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges). You can also read more at [this earlier post on our subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14ayod9/rphilosophy_will_indefinitely_be_in_restricted/).

These changes pose two major issues which the moderators of /r/philosophy are concerned about.

First, the native reddit app is lacks accessibility features which are essential for some people, notably those who are blind and visually impaired. You can read /r/blind's protest announcement [here](https://reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/). These apps are the only way that many people can interact with reddit, given the poor accessibility state of the official reddit app. As philosophers we are particularly concerned with the ethics of accessibility, and support protests in solidarity with this community.

Second, the reddit app lacks many essential tools for moderation. While reddit [has promised better moderation tools on the app in the future](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), this is not enough. First, reddit has repeatedly broken promises regarding features, including moderation features. Most notably, reddit promised CSS support for new reddit [over six years ago](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), which has yet to materialize. Second, even if reddit follows through on the roadmap in the post linked above, many of the features will not come until well after June 30, when the third-party apps will shut down due to reddit's API pricing changes.

Our moderator team relies heavily on these tools which will now disappear. Moderating /r/philosophy is a monumental task; over the past year we have flagged and removed over 20000 posts and 23000 comments. This is a huge effort, especially for unpaid volunteers, and it is possible only when moderators have access to tools that these third-party apps make possible and that reddit doesn't provide.

While we [previously participated in the protests against reddit's recent actions](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14ayod9/rphilosophy_will_indefinitely_be_in_restricted/) we have decided to reopen the subreddit, because we are still proud of the community and resource that we have built and cultivated over the last decade, and believe it is a useful resource to the public. 

However, these changes have radically altered our ability to moderate this subreddit, which resulted in a few changes for this subreddit. First, moderation will occur much more slowly; as we will not have access to mobile tools, posts and comments which violate our rules will be removed much more slowly, and moderators will respond to modmail messages much more slowly. Second, from this point on we will require people who are engaging in self-promotion to reach out and register with the moderation team, in order to ensure they are complying with the self-promotion policies above. Third, and finally, if things continue to get worse (as they have for years now) moderating /r/philosophy may become practically impossible, and we may be forced to abandon the platform altogether. We are as disappointed by these changes as you are, but reddit's insistence on [enshittifying this platform](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/), especially when it comes to moderation, leaves us with no other options. We thank you for your understanding and support.",2024-06-01 19:24:38

Philosophy,1gpsz30,How collaboration gives rise to morality,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1gpsz30/how_collaboration_gives_rise_to_morality/,6,"Road map diagram here

[https://orangebud.co.uk/genealogy\_of\_morality.png](https://orangebud.co.uk/genealogy_of_morality.png)

Collaborating towards a joint goal gives rise to an understanding of mutual dependence and self-other equivalence between partners (Tomasello, 2016).  These give rise in turn, respectively, to joint self-regulation and mutual altruism, and to equality, respect, fairness, and impartiality.  These form the basis of evolved morality\*.  

\* There are other kinds of evolved morality, namely: parenting, pair-bonding, patriarchy, kin selection (Perry, 2024).  

The proposal is that collaborating towards joint goals, with its accompanying evolved psychology, gives rise to the behaviour called morality, and its accompanying evolved psychology.  

 

**Dual-level psychology of collaboration**

Each partner, “you” and “I” is an agent with his or her own will and purpose.  When they act and think intentionally together, they form a joint agent “we”, with joint thinking and joint goals, from which benefits are to be maximised all round.  

The joint agent “we” consists of its individual partners “I” and “you”.  Each has their own perspective on the collaboration.  The perspective of the joint agent “we” is a “bird’s eye view” where it sees roles with people filling them.  Each partner has their own role, and perspective on the joint goal, and their own goals: sub-goals of the overall goal, role ideals.  These role ideals provide the basic pattern for norms and moral standards: a moral standard is a role ideal that belongs to any collaboration alike, such as, hard work, honesty, faithfulness, etc: to be an ideal collaborative partner.  

To coordinate our thinking and intentionality, I may take your perspective, as you may take mine, on the collaboration.  

The joint agent “we” governs you and I, so that I govern myself, and I govern you, and you govern me, on behalf of “us”.  

We can break down the “road map” of how collaboration produces morality into its elements, and the links between them, and define the unfamiliar terms and concepts.  



**Elements of the road map**

(1)  collaboration

Engaging in joint or collective activity with others for mutual benefit.  

 

(2)  interdependence

Depending on one another: I need you, and you need me; I depend on you, and you depend on me.  Symbiosis.  

 

(3)  self-other equivalence between collaborative partners

Partners are equivalent in several ways:

1. each is equally a causative force in the collaboration: each is equally necessary and responsible for what is done.  
2. partners are interchangeable within roles, in that each role could in principle be played by any competent partner.  
3. role ideals are impartial and apply equally to anyone who would play a particular role.  Hence, each person's ego is equally constrained, and so, each is equal in status in this sense.  None of us is free to do what we like, within the collaboration.  

 

(4)  mutual risk and strategic trust

I depend on you (2).  What if you let me down, and fail to collaborate ideally, and we do not achieve our goal?  There is mutual risk, because each depends on the other, and each may be weak and fallible.  In order to get moving, in the face of risk, it is necessary for each partner to trust the other “strategically”: rationally and in one’s own best interests.

 

(5)  mutual value

Because each partner needs (2) and benefits (1) the other, each partner values the other.  

 

(6)  equal status

Self-other equivalence (3) leads to a sense of equal status between partners.  

 

(7)  impartiality

The joint agent “we” governs every partner equally and impartially, since each partner is equivalent and equal (3).  

 

(8)  commitment

To reduce mutual risk (4), partners make a commitment to each other: they respectfully invite one another to collaborate, state their intentions, and make an agreement to achieve X goals together.  This commitment may be implicit -we simply “fall into” it -or explicitly stated.  

 

(9)  legitimacy of regulation

Because we agreed to collaborate (8), we agreed to regulate ourselves in the direction of achieving the joint goal.  The agreement gives the partners a feeling that the regulation is legitimate: proper and acceptable.  

 

(10)  mutual partner control, holding to account, responsibility

Mutual risk (4) and legitimacy of regulation (9) lead to partners governing each other and themselves in the direction of achieving the joint goal.  This regulation takes the practical forms of:

1. partner control -partners govern each other through correction, education, “respectful protest”, punishment, or the threat of exercising partner choice -finding a new partner.  
2. holding to account -I accept that I may be held to account for my behaviour, and you accept that I may hold you to account for your behaviour.  
3. responsibility -the legitimacy tells me that I “should” be an ideal collaborative partner to you.  Hence, I feel a sense of responsibility to you not to let you down in any way, and to see the collaboration through, faithfully, to the end.  

 

(11)  mutual empathic concern, gratitude and loyalty

If I need you and depend on you (2), I therefore value you (5) and feel empathic concern for your welfare.  I am likely also to feel gratitude and loyalty towards you.  

 

(12)  mutual respect and deservingness

If I value you (5) and consider you an equal (6), and we are working together towards joint goals (1), then I am likely to feel that you deserve equal respect and rewards as myself.  

 

(13)  fairness

Because you are equally respected and deserving as myself (12), and we are making impartial judgements of behaviour and deservingness (everyone is treated the same regardless of who they are) (7), the only proper result is one of fairness where each partner is rewarded on some kind of equal basis.  

 

(14)  impartial regulation

The regulation of “us” (8, 9, 10), by you and I, and the regulation of you and I by “us”, is impartial because we are all equivalent (3).  

 

**BASIC MORALITY**

 

Regulation (we > me)

This formula, “we is greater than me”, indicates that the joint agent “we” or “us” is ruling over “you” and “I”.  I govern myself, and I govern you, and you govern me, in the direction of the joint goal, on behalf of “us”, legitimately and impartially.  

 

Altruism (you > me)

This formula is about temporarily putting the interests of others above my own, in order to help them, out of charity, gratitude, loyalty, obligation, etc.  

 

Fairness, respect (you = me)

Equality is the basis of fairness, in two ways: 1) egalitarianism is necessary for fairness in that bullies cannot share fairly: dominants simply take what they want from subordinates, who are unable to stop them; 2) deservingness is decided on some kind of equal basis, whether in equal shares, equal return per unit of investment, equal help per unit of need, etc.  

 

**“The eye of reputation” observes and evaluates cooperative and uncooperative behaviour**

“Reputation” is shorthand for a number of related concepts:

1. my opinion of myself as a cooperator and moral person (personal cooperative or moral identity)
2. the opinion of my past or present collaborative partners of myself as a cooperator and moral person (cooperative identity)
3. my public reputation, the opinion of the world at large of myself as a cooperator and moral person (public moral identity, reputation)  

 

The world, and my collaborative partners, are always monitoring me and evaluating my performance as a cooperator and moral person.  In turn, through self-other equivalence (3), I do the same to myself, as I would any other person.  

According to our reputation or cooperative identity, we may be chosen or not chosen as collaborative partners (partner choice).  This can have important consequences as we all need collaborative partners in life.  Hence, reputation and partner choice form the “big stick” that ultimately turns my sense of responsibility to be an ideal partner (10), into an obligation, if I know what is good for me.  

 

**BASIC NORMATIVITY**

Normativity is defined as the pressure to achieve goals.  The diagram above connects with the structure of normativity (see diagram below).  We may be socially normative (achieve our goals socially) in two ways: cooperatively, with others, to mutual benefit; and competitively, at the expense of others.  There is also individual action which doesn't affect anyone else, and so is neither cooperative nor competitive.  

 

**THE STRUCTURE OF INSTRUMENTAL NORMATIVITY**

In the diagram below, cooperation and competition are the two ways to thrive, survive and reproduce involving other people.  The black “down” arrows mean “depends on, is a result of”, and the words in blue represent evolved drives, the achievement of which produces pleasure.

Philosophy,1gmpdqg,"Reality: A Flow of ""Being"" and ""Becoming"" ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1gmpdqg/reality_a_flow_of_being_and_becoming/,12,"The thesis is that reality is a continuous flow of 'being' and 'becoming,' where entities persist through natural duration rather than relying on an imposed concept of time.

Imagine you’re watching a river. It has parts that appear stable—a specific width, depth, and banks—but it’s also always in motion. It’s moving, changing, yet somehow stays recognizably a river. That’s close to the heart of this philosophy: reality is not just “things that are” or “things that change.” Reality is a seamless, dynamic flow of *both* stable presence (*being*) and ongoing unfolding (*becoming*).

In other words, each entity—like the river or a mountain, or even ourselves—has two intertwined aspects:

1. **Being**: This is the stable part, the “what is.” It’s what makes a tree recognizable as a tree or a river as a river, grounding each entity with a unique, steady presence.
2. **Becoming:** This is the unfolding part, the “always in motion” quality. The tree grows, the river flows, and even our own identities shift and evolve. Becoming is the dynamic side, the continual process that each entity participates in.

**Duration: How Things Persist Without Needing “Time”**

Here’s where it gets interesting: in this view, things don’t actually need “time” in the way we typically think about it. Instead, every entity has its own kind of natural *duration*, or persistence, that doesn’t rely on the clock ticking. Duration is how things stay coherent in their “being” while continuously unfolding in “becoming.”

For example, a mountain persists in its form even as it’s slowly worn down by erosion. Its duration isn’t about the hours, days, or years passing. It’s about the mountain’s intrinsic ability to endure in its own natural way within the larger flow of reality.

**Why Time Isn’t a “Thing” Here, but an Interpretation**

In this view, “time” is something we humans **create** not impose, to understand and measure the flow of this unified reality. We chop duration into hours, days, years—whatever units we find helpful. But in truth, entities like trees, mountains, stars, or rivers don’t need this structure to exist or persist, even 'you'. They have their own objective duration, their own intrinsic continuity, which is just a part of their existence in reality’s flow.

So, in simple terms, this philosophy says:

* Reality *just is* and is constantly *becoming*—a flow of stability and change.
* Entities have *duration*, which is their natural way of persisting, without needing our idea of “time.”
* We use “time” as a tool to interpret and measure this flow, but it’s not a necessary part of how reality fundamentally operates.

This view invites us to see reality as something organic and interconnected—a vast, seamless process where everything is both stable in what it “is” and constantly unfolding through its “becoming.”

I welcome engagements, conversations and critiques. This is a philosophy in motion, and i'm happy to clarify any confusions that may arise from it's conceptualization.

Note: Stability doesn't imply static of fixidity. A human being is a perfect example of this. On the surface, a person may appear as a stable, identifiable entity. However, at every level, from biological processes to subatomic interactions, there is continuous activity and change. Cells are replaced, blood circulates, thoughts emerge, and subatomic particles move in constant motion. Nothing about a human being remains fixed, yet a coherent form and identity are maintained. Stability here emerges as a dynamic interplay, a persistence that holds form while allowing for movement and adaptation. This emphasizes the concept of stability not as a static, unchanging state but as a fluid resilience, allowing a coherent identity to persist through continuous transformation.

This post addresses how we understand reality's nature.

* ***Objection 1***: Isn’t time necessary to understand any persistence or change?
* ***Response***: In this view, time as humans define it isn't fundamental; entities have their own objective durations that enable persistence and change within the flow of reality.
* ***Objection 2***: Does this mean that scientific or empirical concepts of time are irrelevant?
* ***Response***: Not irrelevant, but rather tools we use to interpret a fundamentally timeless reality, where time serves as a helpful construct...",2024-11-08 18:26:22

Philosophy,1fv3hhv,Why doesn’t it has to be the way it is? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1fv3hhv/why_doesnt_it_has_to_be_the_way_it_is/,6,"Is it guilt from within, from all the things I did? Or is it reality—how I see myself? Or perhaps it’s simply what I think I am, the way I think reality is. If that’s the case, allow yourself to accept that it’s not who you were or who you are. Things happened the way they did because the circumstances in your life led to a point where you acted in a way that created guilt. It’s important to realize that it’s not your fault—it just happened. You might feel responsible, but it’s not. Let me tell you why.

First, forgive yourself. You may wonder why you should, if it wasn’t your fault. Forgiving means accepting and giving yourself a chance to grow. Even now, with all the understanding you have, you may not always do the best things because your actions are limited by what you can think and do. No matter how strong your desire or will, you may lack the mentality, mindset, or maturity to act differently. Your actions are shaped by your experience, and sometimes, even doing nothing is the best thing you could manage at the time. It had to happen that way.

Nothing is truly your fault, nor will it ever be, because we are all in the hands of life itself. All the decisions we make, from the smallest impulsive thought to the biggest choices, were never entirely within our control. We are alive, but pure consciousness is responsible for everything that happens within it. I believe that pure consciousness is life itself. Life is what’s living through us. Life gave us the chance to be alive and experience things. It’s called life because we, by being alive, give it meaning. We are life itself, asking questions about our existence.

Life experiences itself through us, although we don’t know how. Perhaps life exists to allow us to experience ourselves. That opportunity alone should make us grateful. Now that we understand our purpose, we wonder about the purpose of life itself. We’ve been asking this question as if we were life itself, forgetting to ask what our purpose is in this life we’ve been given, and for which we should be grateful.

We can only experience what is within us, and life experiences itself through us, within itself. Our perception shapes how we experience life. Each person experiences life differently, and we cannot fully understand what others feel. Emotions are different for everyone and hold different meanings. Life, in many ways, may be experiencing itself through us, just as we experience emotions and feelings. We are shaped by different circumstances and experiences, making us unique individuals, but at our core, we are not that different from each other.

When we realize that we are emotions, feelings, and experiences, we understand that we’re all connected. Our reactions to emotions define who we are, and if we see ourselves and others this way, we’ll see that we’re not so different after all. Emotions and feelings are not exclusive to humans; all living creatures have them. What separates living beings from inanimate objects is their ability to feel. Emotion is the energy in motion, and feelings are the manifestation of that energy. How we feel drives us to act, and what we do defines us.

Emotions and feelings are intertwined. What we experience and how we perceive it shapes how we feel. Judging our experiences as positive or negative determines our emotional state. Feeling good is an emotional state of higher energy in motion, while feeling sad is a state of lower energy in motion.

Humans operate on judgment. Our experiences and circumstances shape our perception of right and wrong. How we perceive things influences our emotional state, which drives our reactions. Over time, we identify ourselves based on how we behave and act in certain situations.

To manipulate emotions, we must first unlearn what we know—unlearn the perceptions injected into us by life’s experiences. These circumstances began the moment life itself began. By unlearning the perceptions forced upon us, we can begin to rewrite our understanding of who we are and how reality works. With awareness, we gain the power to create our own circumstances. But with this power comes great responsibility.

When we learn to take control of our energy and actions, we must also take full responsibility for how we act. If we don’t know what’s right or wrong, it’s our duty to learn and act in ways that won’t harm others. Even if we can manipulate our energy, we may not know which reality to choose. Reality is shaped by our perception. Before we create our reality, we must learn about good and evil and understand how to make a positive impact on our own and others’ lives.

Once we’re aware of how things should be, we become more knowledgeable and capable of clear judgment. However, it may be difficult for others to understand or accept this perspective, and that’s not their fault. We can help raise their awareness and guide them toward higher vibrational states. After that, people are less likely to choose a reality where they suffer.

As living beings, we all strive for love—the highest form of emotion. Love is a combination of all feelings and emotions, and when we reach this state, we feel complete. Our purpose in life is to become the highest form of ourselves, and that means reaching the highest form of emotion—love.

Love what you do, and give love to those you care about. Be love itself. Love the situations and circumstances life brings you, and make the best of them. Your highest form begins with adapting your perceptions. You can reflect on others to see if you want to act like them. If that’s what you desire, then be that person. Sometimes, doing what you love may not align with others’ expectations, but that’s not your problem if you’re true to yourself.

Others may perceive you differently, but don’t let their judgments dictate your behavior. Everything is inside you. True awareness is being fully present, observing without judgment, and feeling complete. You can complete yourself by loving who you are. You can also seek love from others, like a life partner, but there may still be a void if you don’t love yourself.

No matter how much love someone else gives you, you won’t feel complete if you don’t love yourself. True love for someone else begins with loving yourself. When you love others, help them see the beauty within themselves. That’s true love—when you make someone fall in love with who they are. Like a butterfly that cannot see its own wings, we often fail to recognize our own beauty. Yet others see it, and that’s the love they feel for us. But if you don’t love yourself, you may feel undeserving of love.

When we truly love someone, we want to be better for them. This desire for self-improvement is an act of self-love, learned through loving others. Learn from these experiences. If you don’t, life will teach you its lessons, one way or another. Whether you learn them or are taught, each lesson is necessary for growth. Once learned, you can pass them on to others.",2024-10-03 09:09:39

Philosophy,1fueady,Why Christian Methodological Platonism (CMP) Offers a Better Framework for Understanding Reality than Atheistic Methodological Naturalism (AMN),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1fueady/why_christian_methodological_platonism_cmp_offers/,111,"In the ongoing conversation between philosophy and metaphysics, we often see two key frameworks for understanding reality: **Christian Methodological Platonism (CMP)** and **Atheistic Methodological Naturalism (AMN)**—both approaches try to answer the big questions about existence—truth and meaning - but they take us in very different directions. I’m here to argue that CMP aligns far more closely with our shared human experience—especially when it comes to understanding immaterial realities like logic, morality, human dignity, and purpose.

---

### **1. The Existence of Immaterial Realities: Logic and Morality**

We live as though certain immaterial truths—like logic and morality—are objective and universal. Whether you’re talking about the law of non-contradiction or basic moral principles, these seem to apply everywhere and at all times. CMP gives us a foundation for that—it says these truths reflect God’s unchanging nature—they exist independently of human minds—they’re eternal and absolute.

AMN, however, tends to reduce these to evolutionary byproducts or social constructs—things we invented because they help us survive or keep society functioning. But here’s the problem—if logic is just a tool we developed to survive, why does it seem to hold universally—even outside survival situations? And if morality is just a social contract, why do we feel moral obligations even when society’s not looking? CMP fits better with our lived experience—it tells us that logic and morality are real, objective, and binding—because they’re grounded in God’s nature.

---

### **2. Human Dignity and Worth: Grounded in Imago Dei**

We act like people matter—like human life has value—and CMP tells us why. Humans are created in the image of God—**Imago Dei**—which means every person has inherent, unchanging worth—whether or not society recognizes it. Our instincts for justice, human rights, and dignity flow naturally from this foundation—we treat people as valuable because they are—because they reflect God’s image.

AMN, on the other hand, sees humans as just another product of evolution—no more significant than any other species. If we’re just highly evolved animals, there’s no objective reason why human life should be considered any more valuable than that of any other creature. Yet—despite this view—we still live as if human dignity is real and non-negotiable—AMN can’t justify this, but CMP gives a solid reason for why we think and act this way.

---

### **3. Ultimate Meaning: Beyond Survival**

We crave purpose—we’re constantly searching for meaning in our work, relationships, and lives—CMP tells us that’s because we were created with a purpose—to know and glorify God. This framework explains why humans naturally long for something beyond mere survival—we sense that life has ultimate significance. CMP gives that longing a solid grounding—it says our desire for meaning is real, pointing toward a higher calling.

AMN, by contrast, tells us that life’s meaning is whatever we decide it is. But here’s the catch—if meaning is purely subjective, it can evaporate in the face of life’s hardships or when we confront the inevitability of death. AMN leaves us with a void—CMP fills that void with an ultimate purpose—anchoring meaning in something eternal, rather than in our fleeting whims.

---

### **4. Rationality: Why Trust Our Minds?**

Here’s the kicker—CMP gives us a reason to trust our minds. It says the universe is rational because it was created by a rational God—and we’re able to reason because we reflect that same rationality. In CMP, the world is intelligible—because it’s designed to be—and our ability to reason is part of that design.

AMN, though, sees our cognitive abilities as the result of evolution—geared toward survival, not necessarily truth. If that’s the case—why should we trust that our reasoning leads us to actual truth rather than just helping us stay alive? CMP gives us a grounding for rationality itself—it says our minds can grasp truth because they reflect a greater rational order.

---

### **Objections and Responses**

---

**Objection 1: AMN provides a simpler explanation by only appealing to natural causes—CMP complicates things by introducing the supernatural.**

**Response**: The simplicity of AMN is deceptive—it might offer fewer initial variables, but it often leaves the most important questions unanswered—like why logic exists or why we should trust our reasoning. Sure, AMN keeps the explanation to the physical world—but it leaves us with a reality where the immaterial aspects of life—things like morality, logic, and purpose—are left hanging without sufficient grounding. CMP offers a richer, more comprehensive framework—it doesn’t avoid these questions—it addresses them head-on by grounding the immaterial in God’s nature. Occam’s Razor doesn’t always mean the simplest explanation—it means the explanation with the fewest assumptions that still accounts for the data—CMP does that.

---

**Objection 2: Morality is just a product of evolution—it’s subjective but still functional for survival, so there’s no need to appeal to God.**

**Response**: Evolution might explain how moral instincts develop—but it can’t explain why we feel some things are objectively right or wrong—whether or not they help us survive. The fact that we feel moral obligations even when they go against our survival instincts—like risking our lives to save a stranger—suggests something deeper. CMP says morality isn’t just a survival tool—it’s an expression of God’s goodness, which is why we experience moral truths as objective and binding. AMN can’t explain that sense of moral obligation—it reduces morality to a biological quirk, but that doesn’t fit with how we actually experience it.

---

**Objection 3: AMN better fits with scientific inquiry, which is based on empirical observation, while CMP relies on faith in the supernatural.**

**Response**: CMP doesn’t reject empirical observation—it embraces it—but it also acknowledges that empirical science alone can’t explain everything. Science tells us *how* things work, but it can’t tell us *why* they exist or why the universe is intelligible in the first place. CMP says the rational order of the universe reflects the mind of a rational Creator—it’s not a leap of faith—it’s an inference to the best explanation. AMN limits itself to the physical world and dismisses the metaphysical—but that dismissal doesn’t make the metaphysical less real.

---

### **Conclusion: Which Better Fits Our Experience?**

CMP fits with how we actually live and think—whether we’re talking about logic, morality, human dignity, or purpose. We treat these things as real—objective—and universal—CMP says they are. AMN, on the other hand, tends to reduce them to illusions—things we invented to help us survive, but that don’t have any deeper reality. The problem is—we don’t live as if that’s true.

In the debate over which framework better explains reality—CMP aligns more closely with both the physical world and the immaterial truths we all experience. It accounts for both the seen and unseen—and provides a coherent foundation for understanding why we think, act, and believe the way we do.

Philosophy,1fk59fq,Zeno’s Paradox and Democritus’ Atomism as an Ontological Solution,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1fk59fq/zenos_paradox_and_democritus_atomism_as_an/,0,"# 1. Introduction to Zeno's Paradox (Achilles and the Tortoise)

Zeno’s paradox, particularly the tale of Achilles and the tortoise, has fascinated philosophers for centuries. Zeno argued that motion is an illusion by suggesting that if space and time can be divided infinitely, Achilles would never catch the tortoise. This is because, to reach the tortoise, Achilles must first cover half the remaining distance, then half of that, and so on, leading to an infinite series of steps that would never allow him to overtake the tortoise.

This paradox raises a deep ontological question about the nature of space, time, and motion: Is it truly possible to divide space or time indefinitely? If so, how can motion occur in a world with infinite divisions?

# 2. The Traditional Mathematical Solution

A widely accepted modern solution comes from mathematics: the paradox is resolved by demonstrating that the infinite sum of decreasing terms can have a finite value. In Achilles’ case, the infinite series of distances adds up to a finite value, meaning Achilles will catch the tortoise at a specific time.

However, this solution addresses the problem from a quantitative and mathematical perspective, without resolving the underlying philosophical dilemma: the infinite divisibility of space and time. Zeno wasn’t concerned with summing series but with the ontological possibility of infinitely dividing the world, which, in his view, rendered motion illusory. Therefore, while the mathematical solution offers a technical answer, it does not fully address the philosophical concerns Zeno raised.

# 3. My Proposal: An Atomist Solution

I propose that Zeno’s paradox can be resolved from a philosophical standpoint by adopting Democritus’ atomism. According to Democritus, matter is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void. These atoms cannot be divided beyond their minimum size, implying that matter is not infinitely divisible.

This has direct implications for Zeno’s paradox. While empty space might be infinitely divisible, the matter moving through that space cannot be. The atoms that make up the bodies in motion impose a limit on divisibility. Thus, even if space could theoretically be divided infinitely, the atoms composing matter would move in discrete “jumps,” resolving the problem posed by the paradox.

My proposal is based on the fact that what is moving in the paradox is matter, not empty space. Achilles and the tortoise are made of atoms, and since these atoms are indivisible, they move over finite distances, not infinitely small divisions. Even if space could be divided in half down to the size of an atom, the atom itself would still move a full atom-sized distance, not a fraction smaller.

# 4. Development of the Thesis: Atomism as a Solution to Infinite Divisibility

Zeno’s paradox rests on the premise that space and time are infinitely divisible. This leads to the conclusion that, since motion relies on an infinite number of divisions, it can never be completed. However, if we consider Democritus’ atomism, this premise no longer holds true for matter.

For Democritus, matter is made up of atoms, which are indivisible and move through a void. While the void may theoretically be divisible, atoms themselves cannot be divided beyond their minimum size. This means that rather than traversing infinitely small divisions of space, the atoms that compose Achilles and the tortoise move in discrete “jumps.”

Therefore, even if space were divided down to half the size of an atom, the matter (composed of atoms) would only move in distances corresponding to its atomic structure. This solves Zeno’s paradox without resorting to an infinite series of steps or divisions of motion.

By applying Democritus’ atomism to Zeno’s paradox, we eliminate the need to worry about infinite divisibility of space or time. Matter, being composed of atoms, moves within defined limits, allowing us to conclude that Achilles will indeed catch the tortoise.

# 5. Anticipated Objections and Responses

**Objection 1: Confusion between Matter and Space.**  
A common objection might be that my proposal confuses the divisibility of space with the divisibility of matter. While matter may be composed of atoms, space itself could still be infinitely divisible, which would not resolve Zeno’s paradox.

**Response:** It’s important to clarify that my proposal focuses on the fact that what is in motion in the paradox is matter, not space. While empty space may be divisible, material bodies are not. Since the bodies in motion (Achilles and the tortoise) are made up of indivisible atoms, their movement occurs in discrete distances corresponding to those atoms, eliminating the problem of infinite division in motion.

**Objection 2: The Mathematical Solution is Sufficient.**  
Another objection is that the mathematical solution to the infinite series is sufficient to resolve Zeno’s paradox, as it shows that Achilles will indeed catch the tortoise in a finite amount of time.

**Response:** The mathematical solution may resolve the problem quantitatively, but it doesn’t address the ontological core of the paradox: the possibility of infinite divisibility of matter and motion. Zeno was concerned with the nature of reality, not merely the calculation of distances. My proposal offers an ontological solution that rejects the premise of infinite divisibility and directly addresses Zeno’s concerns about motion.

**Objection 3: Democritus’ Atomism is an Archaic Theory.**  
A more modern objection might be that Democritus’ atomism is an outdated theory that has been surpassed by modern physics, making it anachronistic to base a solution on this theory.

**Response:** My thesis does not aim to update atomism, but rather to show how, in its philosophical context, it offers a coherent response to Zeno’s paradox. By addressing the paradox within the framework of ancient thought, atomism provides a valid and relevant solution, resolving the philosophical concerns without altering or modernizing Democritus’ original theory.

# 6. Conclusion: Atomism as a Philosophical Solution to Zeno’s Paradox

In conclusion, Zeno’s paradox can be resolved by adopting Democritus’ atomism, which rejects the infinite divisibility of matter. While mathematical solutions address the problem from a quantitative perspective, atomism provides an ontological solution, demonstrating that matter cannot be infinitely divided. This, in turn, proves the existence of atoms, refutes the paradox, and reaffirms motion as a physical reality.",2024-09-18 22:16:58

Philosophy,1fcfuel,The DOUBLE Knowledge Argument! Back for another whack at Mary's Dumb Room ,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1fcfuel/the_double_knowledge_argument_back_for_another/,120,"Frank Jackson’s 1982 & [1986](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/JacksonWhatMaryDidntKnow1986.pdf) papers are built around a thought experiment. Mary the Color Scientist lives in a Black & White room — she never sees color. However she is given “all the physical facts” about color. And being a genius scientist, she knows all that can then be known about color. One day she is released from her room, and sees red. The question is, as Jackson puts it, “will she *learn* anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had *all* the physical information. *Ergo* there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.” 

Summed up,[ the Knowledge Argumen](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/#DoubAbouThouExpe)[t](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/#DoubAbouThouExpe) is: 

(1) Mary has all the physical information concerning human color vision before her release.

(2) But there is some information about human color vision that she does not have before her release.

*Therefore*:

(3) Not all information is physical information.

This argument is for some reason that utterly escapes me compelling to serious philosophers, and has even bewitched some of them into becoming anti-physicalists. **I will try to show that any inference about physicalism made via the Knowledge Argument is entirely based on the fact that the terms “knowledge” and “physical facts” are poorly defined.**

I have already posted a [long diatribe](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1brvuzm/marys_room_is_an_unsuccessful_dualist_intuition/) about the knowledge argument elsewhere so you might be thinking, “this guy is obsessed.” \*And you’re right!\* No really I do have a life, but I am a little fixated on putting the final nail in the coffin of this thought experiment that I cannot believe get’s taken seriously. However I am always happy to be proven wrong — [Philip Goff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCPCyri1rXU&t=3583s) if you’re out there, come at me bro. In fact, some of the arguments I used before were a little sloppy. But more than anything they’re just overdone — I believe the answer is much simpler. 

I have two related arguments, both showing that Mary’s Room/The Knowledge Argument make no metaphysical claims about the nature of phenomenal consciousness or physical reality, *and perhaps more importantly,* that belief in anti-physical subjective experience (at least as justified by Mary’s Room) is fundamentally theological — it can’t be \*disproved\* with armchair theorizing. 

**Argument 1: The entire thing is semantic. That’s all it is. And it hinges on how poorly defined words like “knowledge” and “information” are in Frank Jackson’s original paper.** 

Jackson begins his description of physical facts like this: “*It is undeniable that the physical, chemical and biological sciences have provided a great deal of information about the world we live in and about ourselves. I will use the label 'physical information' for this kind of information, and also for information that automatically comes along with it.”*

You can refer to Jackson’s paper or my [older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1brvuzm/marys_room_is_an_unsuccessful_dualist_intuition/) for his slightly longer definition of “physical facts,” but I promise there’s not a lot more there — it’s absurdly vague. 

So we have to start by defining our terms. If you’re going to defend the Knowledge Argument, you have to tell me what physical facts are \*in detail.\* Do you mean:

**A) anything that can be written down in a book or communicated via a video or a podcast?** 

Or do you mean:

**B) any information that can be functionally losslessly instantiated and transmitted?** 

Or: 

**C) something else?** 

**Let’s say it’s A).** So Mary the Color Scientist opens the door to her Black & White room and sees Ladder Company No. 5 sitting outside. She takes a good look, decides that the color reeks of communism and it’s not for her, and shuts the door. Did she learn any new physical facts about red? The answer is very simple! No. She did not. What would she have learned that could be written down or that adds to our physical understanding of red? Nothing. 

If I knew every “physical fact” that could be detailed in a textbook about a car motor and then opened the hood of the car and looked at the engine for a second would I be able to meaningfully amend the textbook? No. Obviously not. I would have other new qualia but no new facts about how motors work. This changes nothing about our understanding of physical reality. 

**Let’s say it’s option B).** Up until now, Mary has also possessed every brain state corresponding with black and white. When she sees the fire engine, does Mary posses *new physical information* about red? Hell yes. Of course. She has entered a whole bunch of brain states and fired a ton of previously unfired neurons. She has lots of new, entirely physical information about how seeing red changes her body — she has all the brain states that correlate with seeing red. But physics has no trouble accounting for these brain states — they’re just different measurable physical states. 

How is there a claim about the nature of reality in here? Where is it hiding? Neither of these cases advances the cause of anti-physicalism one iota. 

In fact, you can see quite easily how the semantic nature of this argument breaks down if I change one simple suffix. **What if I say that Mary has all the physical facts about red*****ness***\*\*.\*\* Not about red but about redness. Does she learn anything new by seeing red then? Apparently not since she already knew everything there is to know about redness and therefore red qualia. (Of course we also see how it’s impossible to impart objective information about qualia through words, but that’s not a metaphysical issue its a linguistic one, and an issue I will get to in my second argument.)

(A quick digression into another argument which I won’t develop here: The anti-physicalist might object and say that the fact that we can’t write down objective facts about red qualia *is the point!* That’s proof that there is non-physical knowledge about red. However I would ask the question, “how do you know it’s about red?” Let’s say as a child every time I saw the color blue someone gave me a drug that made me vomit. Now I look at blue and feel sick. Is that a quality-in-the-qualia-sense of the color blue? Or is the aboutness entirely in my very physical and squishy head? If it is the latter, then once again the fact that Mary has a subjective experience when seeing red doesn’t mean she has learned anything new *about* *red*. It just means she has learned something new about herself.)

The bottom line is that there is no deep metaphysical truth being excavated here, just a bunch of miscommunication about the nature of knowledge and information. 

**Argument 2: THE DOUBLE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT!!!** 

Join me in this little thought experiment. 

Mary (Mary Prime) is watched 24/7 by another Mary (Mary II) who also hasn’t seen color. The apparatus monitoring Mary Prime records her brain states. If it helps to make the argument clearer, we can say that the information is printed out on an old-timey dot matrix printer and then scanned into another computer which then plays the data back into the brain of Mary II. 

With the Double Knowledge Argument, we can get rid of all that confusing chaff about “physical knowledge” and textbooks etc. The computer recording everything and the printouts make everything physical. Physical is now stipulated. (However it is physical *information*, not textbook knowledge.)

The only question left is whether Mary II still fails to experience redness in this formulation. This is where the “theological” aspect comes in. Without being able to actually run this experiment (yet) we’re left with simple intuition and nothing else to guide us. If you think that redness qualia is physical data that can in principle be captured and written down, then you will think that Mary II sees red as a result of this experiment. 

If you think that it cannot be captured then you will accept everything in the experiment but say, “Mary II still doesn’t experience the red qualia that Mary Prime had.” That’s fine. But it’s a preexisting intuition. The Knowledge Argument hasn’t done any work here to reveal the truth. 

This argument has been made before in other terms — Jackson’s original paper clearly begs the question with regard to physicalism. However I believe this construction makes clear just how fatal this flaw is to the entire conjecture. Mary’s Room *cannot provide us with any more information than we went in with*, absent a radical redefinition of the terms “physical,” and “facts.”

Now let’s be clear, this isn’t an argument about anti-physicalists (you fools!). It’s just about the validity of the Knowledge Argument on its own merits. There may be other good reasons to be an anti-physicalist, but this isn’t one of them. 

Unless of course I am very stupid and wrong. This is a case where I know a lot of smart people take Mary’s Room seriously and that’s been good in the sense that it’s pushed me to really question whether i understand it. But I still come away feeling like this is just the most unsupportable nonsense in the world, and I am flabbergasted that other people buy it. ",2024-09-09 03:12:32

Philosophy,1ekirgr,"arguments in favor of living life around efficiency, instead of morality",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1ekirgr/arguments_in_favor_of_living_life_around/,42,"In this post, I will try to argue in favor of amorality, and viewing the world based on efficiency.

I will start by explaining what I mean by morality here. Morality is the reason to do something that are not dependent on real benefit. Morality might for example push one to care about the suffering of individual they won't interact with, or make somebody respect the dead.

In relation with this definition of morality, an action is immoral if it goes against morality, and amorality is the attitude of ignoring any reason other than concrete benefit for one's action.

Efficiency is here used to mean the benefit generated by an action in relation to its cost, both the cost necessary to do the action but also the negative repercussion the action will have. For example, murdering your noisy neighbor might seem free, for almost everybody got a sharp enough object in their house to kill somebody, but the cost appear after the act, when a hasty kill will be quickly caught by the local law enforcement, and cause more detrimental consequence for you than the noisy neighbor.

To calculate efficiency, one must know the goal they seek to achieve. That is because consequences, in isolation, are neither bad or good, especially once one take away morality. As such, consequences must be appraised according to if they further your goal, or on the contrary slow down your progress.

I will now start listing the advantage gained from this way of thinking.

The first is that it allows for better and faster decision making. Individuals can simply look at any decision as if it was a choice in a game, and chose according to what they believe will give them the best chances of achieving their goal, rather then having to deal with their interest conflicting with morality.

The second advantage is less responsibility, allowing for an easier state of mind in the current world. The world, at the moment of writing and probably for the foreseeable future, is an atrocious place for many people in it. Somebody that try to live according to morality might feel the duty of helping as many people as they can, while amorality allows one to focus entirely on themselves.

The third advantage is an easier time with the current professional world. Not being slowed down by morality allows one to get an advantage on their competitors, which is crucial in today's hyper competitive workplaces.

The fourth advantage is the reduced chances of hopelessness. One cannot be hopeless if they view the world through the lens of efficiency, for there is always something that can be done. For something to be the most efficient action, it doesn't need to assure success, but simply to be the action that will grant the most progress toward the goal, taking into consideration the probabilities of success. As such, it is always possible to take the most efficient action, even if that action has low probabilities of success. When one can always take an action with hope that it can succeed, then one cannot be hopeless.

The fifth advantage is that viewing the world in an amoral manner allow for ignorance of morality. Defining what action are morally good and morally bad is an extremely difficult task, and amorality grant one the ability to sidestep this problem.

I will now start enumerating the arguments I could come up with against amorality, and I will explain why I do not think they are apt at invalidating my thesis.

The first argument against my thesis is that it objectify people, both the individual using it but also other people. Viewing the world from the point of view of efficiency will inevitably lead to dehumanization, as people will become tool for you to attain your goal. Even yourself will start to be dehumanized, as you become closer to a virtual pet, needing to be fed on time to stay alive, because being alive is necessary for you to achieve your goal. However, I do not think this argument hold much ground, the only reason one would think of objectification as bad is morality., but we already established that this way of thinking is based around amorality. Just like one cannot judge the hormone level of a rock, for the rock doesn't have hormones and isn't meant to have them, one cannot judge an amoral viewpoint on its lack of morality. In addition, one could even think of objectification as a positive, as it allows for an easy way to know your goal. One simply has to think of their life as a tool crafted and given to them by their parents. If you were given a weird tool, your first instinct would be to simply ask the individual who gifted it to you to explain what is its purpose. If they aren't in capacity of answering either because they're absent or don't know the answer, you can either look around for any use the tool could have, or ask around if somebody know how you could use it.

The second argument is the lack of well-being one may get from a lifestyle based around efficiency. One could think of fun activities and hobbies as waste of time and money, and think that if they were to live life for maximum efficiency, they'd have to do without those. However, even if relaxation and comfort aren't your goal, which they could be, one need those to achieve one's goal. One need time to relax and unwind to be able to work on their goal, for if they didn't, they would be simply fated to burn out, which impact negatively your progress.

The third argument is for people that believe in a retribution according to the morality of your actions, be it a judgment after death that allocate you to a an afterlife pleasant or not, or some form of smite imposed by any form of mystic entity to punish those living immorally. One could think that amorality is not suitable for such individual. However, those individual can simply put their goal as “doing good according to my belief”. As such, you will only have to take the minimum of morality needed by your belief, and will still be able to have some of the advantage offered by amorality.

The fourth argument against amorality is that it could be used to justify massacre, large scale violence, and other morally reprehensible act at a large scale. While simple occasional act of immorality, such as murder, occasion a risk disproportionate to the benefit, large scale one, such as genocide, allow for benefit no other action offer, such as extermination of those hated. Such benefit may even be the goal of the individual, leaving no other course of action then large scale violence. However, other viewpoints also allow justification for violence, notably by simply choosing precisely who is considered a moral entity. As such, I don't believe one could say that amorality is not judicious because of what it enable, since other viewpoint do that too. If everybody breaks the law, the law is in practice non existent.

In conclusion, amorality and efficiency give us a way to view the world that allow for an easier and more accomplished life, and as such is a preferable way to live.",2024-08-05 08:37:20
