history,1gpgxua,Franco-Ottoman Marie Tepe: An American Civil War hero who fought for the Union,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1gpgxua/francoottoman_marie_tepe_an_american_civil_war/,9,"I recently came across the fascinating story of **Marie Tepe**, also known as ""French Mary,"" and it completely captured my attention. Born on **August 24, 1834**, in Brest, France, to a Turkish father and a French mother, Marie’s background was incredibly unique for someone living in Civil War-era America. Her family immigrated to the U.S. when she was around 15 years old, and when the Civil War broke out, she made the bold choice to join the Union Army as a **vivandiere**.

Vivandieres were women who provided supplies, nursing, and comfort to soldiers on the front lines. Initially, she served with the **27th Pennsylvania Volunteers**, where her husband was enlisted. But after a dramatic incident involving her husband and other drunken soldiers stealing from her, she left the regiment and joined **Collis’ Zouaves**, the 114th Pennsylvania Infantry. Known for their striking uniforms, inspired by French and Ottoman military styles, Marie fit right in with their distinctive look.

Marie’s bravery was evident on the battlefield. During the **Battle of Fredericksburg**, she was wounded in the ankle while helping set up a field hospital. Despite her injury, she continued to assist the soldiers and was later awarded the **Kearny Cross** for her courage, though she humbly refused to wear it. She also played a significant role during the **Battle of Chancellorsville**, where she brought water and supplies to the wounded under heavy fire.

Despite her heroism, Marie’s post-war life was filled with hardship. She never received a military pension, despite her years of service, and struggled to make ends meet. Sadly, after years of battling poverty and illness, she took her own life in 1901. Her grave remained unmarked for nearly a century until historians and Civil War enthusiasts placed a proper headstone in 1988.

Marie Tepe’s story is a powerful reminder of the diverse backgrounds of those who served in the Civil War, especially the women who defied societal expectations. Her story was nearly lost to history, but thankfully, researchers have brought her legacy back into the light.

history,1go7ybp,West African Swords and how to understand them: an example through inadequacy,290,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1go7ybp/west_african_swords_and_how_to_understand_them_an/,15,"A little bit of background: I was gathering a compendium on West African mythological weapons for a personal project, and I was focused on two swords displayed a myriad of times on the famous Benin Bronzes, the Ada and Eben, but sadly there is little information on the two blades, after an eternity of researching and posting on the Historum African Forum I gathered a lacklustre amount of information on its origin and then I was urged to commit the ultimate taboo......... and that was to use Wikipedia for sources on African history, and to my expectations, it was so horrendous I assume it's by a guy who knows nothing about swords or someone who is neither of the Edo or Yoruba ethnic group, So I'll try clean it up, I will detail everything I picked up, here's the Wiki link by the way.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada\_and\_Abere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_and_Abere)

Background: The editor convolutes his sources, conflates the many different ""Ada"" for a single sword that is of a similar type, and refuses to make that distinction, despite his source doing so. He then goes into historical revisionism on a bad fringe attempt.

Error Number One taken from the Introduction section: ""***State swords have been used for centuries to represent the ancient rights bestowed from Ife to various Yoruba, Yoruboid, and neighbouring groups, including the*** [***Fon***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_people)***,*** [***Ga***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga-Adangbe_people)***, and*** [***Benin Kingdom***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin)***"".*** Great!

Slight Problem here is his source for this, (*Art and Risk in Ancient Yoruba: Ife History, Power, and Identity, c. 1300)* Suzanne Preston Blier says: ""During coronations, individual Yoruba Kings would contact the Oranmiyan priest at Ife (Eredumi) to acquire a ""sword of state"" a tradition purportedly followed by the Edo, Fon, and Gan kings as well. Such a ritual in essence served to both promote and legitimize the use of these ^(long swords) throughout the broader area.""

About that...... the Ada nor the Eben are longswords or Long swords or Long-swords (Poynor et. al 2024)

Take a look:

[https://umma.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/69362\_ca\_object\_representations\_media\_1334\_original.jpg](https://umma.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/69362_ca_object_representations_media_1334_original.jpg)

And here is a long sword ([ https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/27966](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/27966) ):

[https://www.theknightshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/364x364/f59d29ad4c22cdd1dd61568d41112f23/d/s/dsc\_4459\_\_15034\_2.jpg](https://www.theknightshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/364x364/f59d29ad4c22cdd1dd61568d41112f23/d/s/dsc_4459__15034_2.jpg)

And no, the author has no reason to refer to the Ada or the Eben in this matter as long swords, there is no context in that section of the book where she would need to.

So whatever sword she was referring to was not the Ada or the Eben swords, though as you'll see later on, I'm sure the editor was referring to the Ada.

The next error is found in the ""**Àdá""** section where he states:  ""*The Ada took the forms of the* ***Hwi*** *and* ***Gubasa*** *which were mandatory among the Fon in the coronation of every ruler*"". This is FALSE his source for such a claim is ""*Sandra T Barnes Africa's Ogun, Second, Expanded Edition: Old World and New""*

The editor conflates Amose's ""Great Sword of Justice and the Fon Sword of Ogun"" and then bizarrely conflates both for the Gubassa sword which he then conflates for an Ada blade then he conflates the Benin ""Ada"" for the Oyo Sword of Justice....... let me put this bluntly THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SWORD. You the reader are confused, aren't you?

Here is the source:[ https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8OWjkR-1btMC&q=gubasa+sword+justice&redir\_esc=y#v=onepage&q=gubasa%20sword%20justice&f=true](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8OWjkR-1btMC&q=gubasa+sword+justice&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=gubasa%20sword%20justice&f=true)

Let me break it down: Amos speaks about the symbolic meaning of the sword in the religion of the Fon people *not A sword but swords* so no particular sword was in the conversation initially,

So next was the Great Sword of Justice that Amos noted to being the same type as an Edo Ada mind you, NOT THE SAME SWORD but the same type of an ""Ada"" blade, for example

**The Longsword Type XVIIIc**

[https://swordis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Longsword-Type-XVIIIc.png](https://swordis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Longsword-Type-XVIIIc.png)

 **Longsword Type XVa**

[**https://swordis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Longsword-Type-XVa.png**](https://swordis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Longsword-Type-XVa.png)

These are two different longswords, mind you they are the same ""type"" of a sword but are ultimately different whether it be in grip, ricasso or pommel, which leads to a separate categorization or development (Oakeshott, 1991). The same Idea falls for the ""Ada"" blade where there are different types of ""Ada"" one of them being the Sword of Justice referenced by Amos, but the Benin Ada is not the same Sword of Justice and has its separate origin predating the Ife Kingly title (I Joseph, 2014). This shows how the editor conflates blades under the ""Ada"" category of being the same sword under the Sword of Justice when they are all different. Amos and Poynor adhere to this idea and consistently refer to them as different ""types"" of swords, but not the same, so it is prevalent in academia.

Now the claim the Gubassa and Hwi are Ada blades is blatant misinformation, I'm not as well studied on the Hwi but I'm confident both blades are different, he claims the sword of Justice ""Ada"" the Fon King got from Ife was the Gubassa, which in Fon myth is directly from Gu (The Iron and fire God) and is NOT from Ife.

([ https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/25-2/Benin.pdf](https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/25-2/Benin.pdf) )

So to Summarise this section of the debunk, There are many swords of the ""Ada"" type as pointed out by Amos, the Sword of Justice, Benin Ada and Ada Ogun, and many more I presume.

The Gubassa and Hwi are NOT ADA SWORDS, nor are they under that classification.

The next section of the debunk is the ""**Abẹ̀rẹ̀**"" where he states *An Abere is a Yoruba word for a state sword said to be used by different tribes. Cyril Punch in his visit to the king of Benin in 1889, documented the use of a fan-like blade being twirled in the hands of chiefs during a ceremony. In his illustrations, he labelled and referred to the object as an “Ebere”. While his account contains the earliest known written name of the sword in the Benin kingdom, this type of object is more commonly known today as an “Eben” by the Edo people. A divergence in names for the same object is not a strange thing, as even across Yoruba dialects, the Owo people refer to their ceremonial fan blade as an “Ape”.*

One thing you'll immediately notice is the lack of information in comparison to the ""Ada"" Section and it makes complete sense when you realise its unsourced assumption after assumption after assumption, No source to prove the linguistic change from Abere to Ebere from a Yoruba Linguist or a historian shows its already sketchy enough, It is no secret that the Eben Twirling Blade is unique to the Benin Kingdom, unlike the ""Ada"" types of blade prevalent throughout Yorubaland.

Many Yoruba Kingdoms indeed have the Eben blade, but those are Yoruba Kingdoms (Like Owo, Warri and Lagos) uniquely under domination by the late Benin Empire or within the EdoPeoples's sphere of influence, which due to the empire was quite dominant in eastern Yorubaland ( Akintoye, 1969), the citation here by Professor Akintoye is a well regarded academic on Yoruba History and wrote A History of the Yoruba People in 2010, and still conceded the fact that the Oval sword seen in Northwestern Yorubaland (Eben) is of Edo Origin (Akintoye, 1969).

Now the Pictures he used........ lmao not even those are accurate

One of the pictures is the Udamalore of the Owo Kingdom which is a form of an *udà* a blade that is distinct from an Àdá (Poynor, 2024).

Here is an Udamalore:[ https://mitp.silverchair-cdn.com/mitp/content\_public/journal/afar/57/3/10.1162\_afar\_a\_00775/3/m\_afar\_a\_00775.figure.15.jpeg?Expires=1733553201&Signature=q5jiTinpZRXs7ldkM65p2ZKQZeMl0zlprXZULIq2WxBDQMG7s-xrWj6wNPyQBTLqqUHX4mrkqFmXMHTLj9luyacBqRxE9UuIdCaVv1lmV5eJwmhQagEtPWv2p1nTmgngQ0fG1vbCjtxaeFLBJqf9\~AyjwlV5MC9-JDkRlWi6RPtjJkgwFb4UuSjKI2cPdA9t2RvO6YnzwORXOC-1KVBKlfHWKBVF8bJPJHNjZ7WT9PvD1SN\~CvxtI\~2SjNIcF6TUFxzP44wRR3XbMUJ6exNeDByToTMZ-ksDlGQTjbkg4VlVO0UpUanqg8ehOBUF4Q54Q7syum80a0kdZy0VC8YOgg\_\_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA](https://mitp.silverchair-cdn.com/mitp/content_public/journal/afar/57/3/10.1162_afar_a_00775/3/m_afar_a_00775.figure.15.jpeg?Expires=1733553201&Signature=q5jiTinpZRXs7ldkM65p2ZKQZeMl0zlprXZULIq2WxBDQMG7s-xrWj6wNPyQBTLqqUHX4mrkqFmXMHTLj9luyacBqRxE9UuIdCaVv1lmV5eJwmhQagEtPWv2p1nTmgngQ0fG1vbCjtxaeFLBJqf9~AyjwlV5MC9-JDkRlWi6RPtjJkgwFb4UuSjKI2cPdA9t2RvO6YnzwORXOC-1KVBKlfHWKBVF8bJPJHNjZ7WT9PvD1SN~CvxtI~2SjNIcF6TUFxzP44wRR3XbMUJ6exNeDByToTMZ-ksDlGQTjbkg4VlVO0UpUanqg8ehOBUF4Q54Q7syum80a0kdZy0VC8YOgg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)

Also, an Ada-Ogun as he shows for some reason, can be any blade or sword as long as it's Ceremonially for Ogun. his source ( mentions sword(s) and not a single sword, another such case...... as well as the insane variety of an ""Ada-Ogun""

A Dagger-like Ada-Ogun

[https://emuseum.miami.edu/internal/media/dispatcher/8075/preview](https://emuseum.miami.edu/internal/media/dispatcher/8075/preview)

A ""Hwi but less bulbous"" looking Ada-Ogun

[https://emuseum.mfah.org/internal/media/dispatcher/286960/preview](https://emuseum.mfah.org/internal/media/dispatcher/286960/preview)

The most ""Ada-looking"" Ada-Ogun

[https://cdn.drouot.com/d/image/lot?size=fsquare&path=2331/143487/fcf1062d7264e0a4ef3ba35551298ebd](https://cdn.drouot.com/d/image/lot?size=fsquare&path=2331/143487/fcf1062d7264e0a4ef3ba35551298ebd)

Those are just examples I've seen.

Next is the **Archaeology section**, where he states: *Whether for ceremonial use, or conventional use, it is evident that swords across these cultures have taken on varied identities, and many early oral traditions point to Ife as a source of their royal authority. Archaeological discoveries of ancient sword carvings in rock have been found in Ife.*

**"" And many early oral traditions point to Ife as a source of their royal authority""**

**W**ell no. Let's run the List shall we

Benin Ada and Eben - From the Ogiso (I. Joseph 2014)

Ada-Ogun - From Ogun (Witte, 1976)

Sword of Justice Ada - From Ife (Barnes, 1997)

Gubassa- From Gu ([ https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/25-2/Benin.pdf](https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/25-2/Benin.pdf) )

Udamalore - From the Ancestors (Poynor, 2024)

And finally, you know one really funny thing that I didn't even realise while making this, NONE OF HIS SOURCES MENTION THE BLADES, absolutely none mention the Eben except dictionaries and only Johnson and Amos indirectly call out the Ada but not the Benin Ada blade lmao but a similar type. It was all a very terrible attempt and a reach by the editor to reach some kind of obvious conclusion that the eben originates from Ife, despite literally 0 scholars claiming so and even for an original Concept the research was so badly put together and incoherent, and people will be believing it to since it's on wiki.

history,1g2yfv4,The Armenian Genocide,371,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1g2yfv4/the_armenian_genocide/,79,"The Armenian Genocide of 1915 stands as a stark departure from the centuries-long treatment of Armenians within the Ottoman Empire. Historically, Armenians were part of the millet system, where religious minorities like Christians and Jews were granted a degree of autonomy under Ottoman Islamic rule. While they were subject to certain legal and social restrictions, such as higher taxes and limitations on political participation, they were generally tolerated and even flourished in urban and economic life. Armenians were often referred to as the “loyal millet” for their perceived loyalty to the Sultan. The coexistence between Muslims and Armenians, while imperfect, was marked by a level of mutual accommodation that allowed Armenians to maintain their religious and cultural practices for centuries within a predominantly Muslim empire.

However, the rise of secular Turkish nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries profoundly altered this dynamic. The Young Turks, particularly after taking power in 1908, promoted a vision of a homogenous Turkish nation that conflicted with the multi-ethnic and multi-religious fabric of the Ottoman Empire. Secularists within the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), who led the empire during World War I, viewed the Armenians as a threat to the territorial integrity of the state, especially given the rise of Armenian nationalist movements and the empire's losses in wars with Christian powers. The decision to expel, massacre, and deport Armenians from Eastern Anatolia was driven more by nationalist and strategic concerns than religious ideology, reflecting a modern secular nationalist vision that saw minorities as expendable in the quest to secure a cohesive Turkish state.

While the leadership of the Ottoman state was responsible for orchestrating the genocide, many individual Muslims resisted these policies and helped Armenians at great personal risk. Stories of Muslim neighbors hiding Armenian families, providing food and shelter, and even aiding their escape are well documented. Some local officials and religious leaders also protested against the massacres, arguing that they violated the core principles of Islamic law, which emphasized the protection of life, even for non-Muslims under Islamic rule. These acts of humanity highlight the disconnect between the secular nationalist agenda of the ruling elite and the traditional Islamic values of coexistence and protection of minority rights.

The Armenian Genocide, therefore, cannot be understood solely through the lens of religious conflict. It was the secular nationalist aspirations of the CUP that transformed long-standing social tensions into a campaign of extermination and expulsion. The assistance provided by Muslims to Armenians during this dark period serves as a powerful reminder that religious solidarity and human compassion often transcended the divisive nationalist ideologies of the time. It also underscores the fact that many within the Ottoman Empire did not support the genocide, and that the brutality was not inherent to the broader Muslim population, but rather a result of a specific political project aimed at reshaping the empire's ethnic and national identity.

Sources;

Taner Akçam, a prominent historian and one of the leading scholars on the Armenian Genocide, whose works such as The Young Turks' Crime Against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire (2012) offer in-depth analysis of the transition from Ottoman multi-ethnic society to the secular, nationalist policies that fueled the genocide.

Donald Bloxham, in The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians (2005), discusses the role of secular nationalism and the modern state apparatus in the orchestration of the genocide, while also noting the complexities of religious and ethnic coexistence in the Ottoman Empire before 1915.

Raymond Kévorkian, in The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History (2011), provides a comprehensive account of the genocide, exploring both the involvement of the Young Turks and the role of individual Muslims who opposed the violence or helped Armenians.

Fatma Müge Göçek, in her book Denial of Violence: Ottoman Past, Turkish Present, and Collective Violence Against the Armenians, 1789-2009 (2015), analyzes the role of secularism and modern nationalism in shaping the policies that led to the Armenian Genocide, as well as the actions of those who resisted such policies.",2024-10-13 20:02:38

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei

However, there are certain controversies about their origin. In his recent work (2017) with title ""Languages of Ancient Southern Mongolia and North China A Historical-Comparative Study of the Serbi or Xianbei Branch of the Serbi-Mongolic Language Family,with an Analysis of Northeastern Frontier Chinese and Old Tibetan Phonology"" author Andrew Shimunek used name ""Serbi"" for this people, as it is believed to be reconstruction of their original name:  

https://www.google.rs/books/edition/Languages_of_Ancient_Southern_Mongolia_a/V-BjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbi%E2%80%93Mongolic_languages

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIy9JKVNMGc

According to this article, ancient Chinese texts basically described Xianbei (Serbi) people as Indo-Europeans:

https://www.dandebat.dk/eng-dan14.htm

Furthermore, an genetic analysis of population of the Xiongnu state (which predeced Xianbei / Serbi state) clearly shows an important Sarmatian component in this population:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xiongnu_ancestry.png

As it is already well known, Serbi were one of the tribes in eastern European Sarmatia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Colchis,_Iberia,_Albania,_and_the_neighbouring_countries_ca_1770.jpg

It is believed by some researchers that part of these Sarmatian Serbi moved to the west, where it was slavicized and gave its name to current people of Serbs and country of Serbia.

However, I have not yet seen some researches where Serbi in eastern Asia are connected to Sarmatians despite the fact that presented data shows possible connection. Xiongnu and Xianbei (Serbi) states in eastern Asia were multiethnic and it is likely that Sarmatians who were known as Xianbei (Serbi) were actually an ruling class in Xianbei (Serbi) state, while Serbi language explained by Shimunek in his book was rather a most common language spoken in this state by Para-Mongolic population, which was ruled by Sarmatian upper class.

history,1g142pk,Manipulation through Masculinity: How Norse Women Used 'Ergi' to Influence Men,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1g142pk/manipulation_through_masculinity_how_norse_women/,69,"
In Norse society, the concept of 'ergi' - implying unmanliness or effeminacy - was one of the most severe insults a man could face. Interestingly, the sagas provide numerous examples of women weaponizing this concept to manipulate men into action. Let's explore some of these instances:

1. Njáls saga: Hildiglúmr's wife accuses her husband of cowardice to pressure him into avenging their son's death. She essentially questions his manhood, a subtle form of 'ergi' accusation.

2. Laxdæla saga: Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir goads her brothers into avenging her husband Bolli's death. She tells them, ""It may be that you think more like daughters than sons of Ósvífr if you do not avenge such a brother-in-law as Bolli was."" This comparison to women directly challenges their masculinity.

3. Gísla saga Súrssonar: Þórdís pressures her husband Börkr to avenge her brother Þorgrímr, implying he's less of a man than Gísli if he doesn't act.

4. Völsunga saga: Brynhildr incites Gunnar to kill Sigurðr by suggesting he's not a true man if he allows Sigurðr to live after sleeping with her.

5. Orkneyinga saga: Count Sigurðr's wife urges him to attack the Scots, insinuating cowardice if he refuses.

These examples demonstrate how women in Norse sagas used accusations related to 'ergi' or lack of masculinity to manipulate men, particularly in matters of vengeance or conflict. This tactic allowed women to exert influence in a society where they often had limited direct power.

It's important to note that while these sagas provide valuable insights into Norse culture, they were written down centuries after the events they claim to describe. Therefore, they may reflect 13th-century attitudes as much as or more than those of the Viking Age.

This phenomenon highlights the complex gender dynamics in Norse society and demonstrates how deeply ingrained concepts of masculinity and honor were in their culture. It also shows how women, despite their generally subordinate position, could wield significant influence through manipulation of these cultural norms.

What are your thoughts on this aspect of Norse culture? How do you think this compares to gender dynamics in other medieval societies?

Homosexuality and other gender and sexual minorities became surprisingly accepted in Weimar Germany.  Prior to the 1933 Nazi government, gay clubs were a somewhat common sight in German cities, with some sources citing about 100 establishments catering to LGBT+ people in Berlin alone..  Paragraph 175 of the Weimar legal code determined sex acts between men illegal, though there were attempts made to strike down this legislation.  Such attempts ultimately failed, though by 1933 public acceptance of LGBT+ people was higher than anywhere else in Europe.

This rise in acceptance in Weimar Germany is commonly known as The First Homosexual Movement.  

Institut für Sexualwissenschaft and Magnus Hirschfeld

Magnus Hirschfeld was a physician in Weimar Germany, who himself was a gay Jewish man.  He specialized in researching human sexuality and gender identity, and on July 6th 1919 opened the Institute for Sexual Research.  This was a private clinic that aimed to broaden the understanding of what we now call LGBT+ people, promote sexual education, and support LGBT+ individuals.  This clinic revolutionised gender conformation procedures.  The institute housed a significant library of literature written about human sexuality and gender identity.

The Raid of Institut für Sexualwissenschaft
On May 6th, 1933, Nazi soldiers raided the institute,  and performed a publicized book burning of over 20,000 books in the institute's library.  Voiceovers in the footage of the burning deemed the literature ""the intellectual garbage of the past"".  

Most of the individuals involved with the institute fled Germany, though one individual involved at the institute, a physician by the name Gohrbandt, joined the Luftwaffe and became a chief medical advisor.

The Nazi Regime
LGBT+ people living under the Nazi Regime were heavily oppressed.  Paragraph 175 became heavily enforced, and between 5000 and 15000 men were tried and convicted of homosexuality.  Many of these men would be placed in concentration camps, tortured, castrated, or murdered.  Many Lesbians were also sent to concentration camps usially being prosecuted for crimes such as prostitution, lewdness, and asociallity.

The Pink Triangle
Gay men in concentration camps were forced to wear a pink triangle on them to denote their status as homosexuals.  Such status subjected them to particularly brutal treatment from Nazi guards and other prisoners alike.  Many were murdered by other inmates.  Medical experimentation was performed on these men, including castrations, as a means to identify a way to convert them into heterosexuals.  Wearers of the Pink triangle were also segregated in ""sissy blocks"", away from the general camp population.

One incident in 1941 saw 5 gay men in Sachenhausen taken to a bathroom, have hoses shoved down their throats, and be subsequently drowned.  

Murders at Klinkerwerk
Klinkerwerk was a subcamp of Sachsenhausen.  People held there were forced to make munitions for the Nazi war effort, and it's conditions were particularly brutal.  One incident in 1942 saw 200 gay men were systematically murdered in Klinkerwerk.  

Post Nazi Germany
After the war, many men convicted of homosexuality in Nazi Germany were forced to serve their full prison sentences given to them by the Nazi regime, while other prisoners in concentration camps were liberated.  LGBT+ survivors of the Nazi regime were not recognized or compensated. Paragraph 175 was not repealed in Germany until 1994.  In 2002, the German Government pardoned people convicted of homosexuality by the Nazis.

Conclusion
This is but a small sample of LGBT+ history during World War II.  I hope it sparks some of us to continue to learn about the history of LGBT+ people in general, as well as the atrocities committed by both Nazi and allied countries in the first half of the 1900's.

About me.
I am a 25 year old LGBT+ person in western Canada.  My interest in the persecution of LGBT+ people in Nazi Germany was piqued when I asked what happened to gay people in Nazi Germany while in social studies class in high school, and my teacher couldn't give a satisfying answer.  This has lead to several years of interest in the topic of LGBT+ people in Nazi Germany, as well as LGBT+ history in general.  I only speak English and some Russian, and as such I am unable to cite sources written in German.  My sources for this post will mostly be articles written in English by historians.

Lest we forget.

*Background:*  
Antisemitism has deep roots in American history, yet outside a few well-known incidents, that history is little known. [Antisemitism, U.S.A.](https://www.r2studios.org/show/Antisemitism-USA/) is a ten-episode podcast produced by [R2 Studios](https://www.r2studios.org/) at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. The podcast tells the history of antisemitism in the United States from the founding of the country down to the present. This AMA is being held with the historians who created that show: [Zev Eleff](https://www.gratz.edu/about/office-of-the-president) (Gratz College), [Lincoln Mullen](https://lincolnmullen.com/) (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media), [Britt Tevis](https://www.britttevis.com/) (Syracuse University), and [John Turner](https://johngturner.com/) (George Mason University).

What do you want to know about the history of antisemitism in the United States? What does antisemitism have to do with citizenship? With race? With religion? With politics? With conspiracy theories? What past efforts to combat antisemitism have worked? What does the history of antisemitism in the U.S. tell us about antisemitism on digital platforms like Reddit? Please feel free to ask them anything about that history.",2024-09-11 13:26:15

I’m a National Geographic Explorer and Assistant Professor/Curator of Archaeology at the University of Colorado-Boulder, where I conduct scientific research into horse domestication and important changes in the human-horse relationship, from the innovation of the saddle and the stirrup all the way to the replacement of the Pony Express by the transcontinental railroad.

Drawing from history, archaeological science, emerging technologies like ancient DNA, alongside Indigenous perspectives and new field discoveries, the book explores how momentous events in the story of humans and horses helped create the world we live in today. Tracing the horse's origins and spread from the western Eurasian steppes to the invention of horse-drawn transportation and the explosive shift to mounted riding, *Hoof Beats* gives a new account of how horses altered the course of human history, from the origins of globalization, trade, biological exchange, and social inequality.

*Hoof Beats* has been reviewed by the *New York Times, Science Magazine*, and *Psychology Today.* Science calls it a ""fantastically rich narrative,"" and the NYT dubs it ""that too-rare work that is as authoritative as it is legible to the pay audience.""

Ask me anything about horses in the ancient world – from the scientific controversy over their initial domestication, to their changing role in our rapidly-shifting, post-industrial world.

I encourage everyone to have a look at Hoof Beats if this is interesting to you - there's a lot in there that will hopefully encourage more horsey discussions!

[Blog post](https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2022/02/the-art-of-healing-a-nostalgic-ode-to-black-hair-braiding/#:~:text=In%20the%20era%20of%20slavery,would%20lead%20them%20to%20safety.)

Recently, there has been a trend of posts online claiming that American slaves would use braids or other hair fixing methods to hide plans to escape. There is a similar claim about hiding seeds. 

No history class I know of teaches this as fact, but that does not make it untrue. A quick google search will give you dozens of results, mostly [blog posts](https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2022/02/the-art-of-healing-a-nostalgic-ode-to-black-hair-braiding/#:~:text=In%20the%20era%20of%20slavery,would%20lead%20them%20to%20safety.), making this claim. What none of them provide is any historical evidence. They will be quick to make claims, yet I have seen nothing beyond these claims. I have seen dozens of blogs of this type, none with any links to sources that are not essentially other blog posts, which eventually makes you wonder if there was ever a source at all. There is precedent, but the earliest claim I’ve seen is another internet post. Does any evidence exist? I have seen books that include the claim, but as far as I can tell those are dead ends as well.

Another thing to look at is the feasibility of such a thing. What would the complicated and easily visible practice of cornrows provide that oral repetition could not? Seed hiding makes a little more sense, but still lacks the evidence of the former claim.

This would be a terrible piece of history to lose if it was true, but I have been given no reason to believe that it is. [Here](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/03/12/maps-cornrows-black-slaves-escape/ ) is the snopes article on the subject. There is no claim of evidence to the subject there either, but it is an imperfect source. It is well regarded, but like anything made by people it carries bias and isn’t always correct.

I mean no disrespect to the subject by any of this, I am simply looking for information. Please don’t argue in the comments either.

Abstract from the article: ""In the period between 5,300 and 4,900 calibrated years before present (cal. BP), populations across large parts of Europe underwent a period of demographic decline. However, the cause of this so-called Neolithic decline is still debated. Some argue for an agricultural crisis resulting in the decline, others for the spread of an early form of plague. Here we use population-scale ancient genomics to infer ancestry, social structure and pathogen infection in 108 Scandinavian Neolithic individuals from eight megalithic graves and a stone cist. We find that the Neolithic plague was widespread, detected in at least 17% of the sampled population and across large geographical distances. We demonstrate that the disease spread within the Neolithic community in three distinct infection events within a period of around 120 years. Variant graph-based pan-genomics shows that the Neolithic plague genomes retained ancestral genomic variation present in *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis*, including virulence factors associated with disease outcomes. In addition, we reconstruct four multigeneration pedigrees, the largest of which consists of 38 individuals spanning six generations, showing a patrilineal social organization. Lastly, we document direct genomic evidence for Neolithic female exogamy in a woman buried in a different megalithic tomb than her brothers. Taken together, our findings provide a detailed reconstruction of plague spread within a large patrilineal kinship group and identify multiple plague infections in a population dated to the beginning of the Neolithic decline.""",2024-07-20 15:44:42

history,1dvfkpy,"Were the ""Ring of Silvianus"" finds as improbable as they sound? ",96,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1dvfkpy/were_the_ring_of_silvianus_finds_as_improbable_as/,9,"A pair of artifacts of late Roman Britain which I find puzzling are the ""Ring of Silvianus"" and the 'curse tablet' invoking Nodens which seems to be related to it but was found at a completely unrelated excavation at a distant site. Here is my (perhaps incorrect) understanding of them and how they were found:

1. In 1786 a farmer in Silchester in southern England found a gold ring in a plowed field. It is believed to be from sometime in the 300s and bears the inscription ""SENICIANE VIVAS IIN DE"". In *Christianity in Roman Britain to AD 500*, Charles Thomas states that this inscription was made incorrectly and it should be SENICIANE VIVAS IN DEO"".
2. In 1817, almost 100 miles away in western England, someone found a lead tablet in a temple complex dedicated to the god Nodens. There were other tablets found there praying to Nodens for healing, but this particular tablet instead invokes Nodens for a curse upon someone named Senicianus. The Latin inscription is apparently ""DEVO NODENTI SILVIANVS ANILVM PERDEDIT DEMEDIAM PARTEM DONAVIT NODENTI INTER QVIBVS NOMEN SENICIANI NOLLIS PETMITTAS SANITATEM DONEC PERFERA VSQVE TEMPLVM DENTIS"". A museum there translates that as ""For the god Nodens. Silvianus has lost a ring and has donated one-half \[its worth\] to Nodens. Among those named Senicianus permit no good-health until it is returned to the temple of Nodens.""

As I recall from Latin class 15 years ago, the name Senicianus uses the second declension. Which means Seniciane is the vocative (which is what you use to speak to Senicianus directly). So 'SENICIANE VIVAS IN DEO' would mean ""Senicianus, live in God!"" So the name from the ring matches the name of the person from the tablet who is supposed to return the ring.

Articles and museum descriptions seem to assume that this ring *is* the ring which the curse tablet mentions.

That seems like a startlingly lucky find to me. What are the odds that the specific lost/stolen ring which a single tablet mentions would not only survive but be found? It isn't even as if the sites were related or the same team discovered them. They were discovered 30 years apart and almost 100 miles apart. For that matter, they seem religiously very different. The ring's inscription seems to be Christian, whereas the curse tablet seems to be from a fusion of the Celtic worship of Nodens with later Roman additions.

Is there another explanation beyond amazing luck? For example, was Senicianus an extremely common name, with this not necessarily being the ring of the same Senicianus from the curse tablet? Or is there some other way in which they might not actually be connected?

He is often associated with the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order founded to defend Christianity in Eastern Europe. The name ""Dracula"" has its roots in this association.

The term ""Dracula"" is derived from the Latin word ""draco,"" meaning ""dragon."" Vlad's father, Vlad II, was inducted into the Order of the Dragon in 1431, earning him the moniker ""Vlad Dracul,"" or ""Vlad the Dragon."" As a result, Vlad III, his son, adopted the surname ""Dracula,"" meaning ""son of the dragon"" or ""son of Dracul"" .

The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the advance of the Ottoman Empire, and its members pledged to defend Christianity against its enemies. Vlad III's adoption of the name ""Dracula"" was a reflection of his father's legacy and his own commitment to this cause. The name symbolized not only his lineage but also his allegiance to the Order's mission.

However, the name ""Dracula"" has since been intertwined with a more sinister connotation, largely due to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ""Dracula,"" which fictionalized Vlad as a vampire count. Despite this literary association, the historical Vlad Tepes bore the name ""Dracula"" as a proud emblem of his heritage and his role as a staunch defender of Christian Europe .

I also found some information on later horse breeding programs by Spanish kings, however, would anyone be able to help me find information about what the day to day running of monastic stud farms would be like?

(Note: my information is biased toward Spain as that's where I've found most of my information so far, but I am interested in the horse breeding practices of monastic stud farms more generally and if anyone has any good information from other locations please don't hesitate to share!)

Thanks so much for any help, I appreciate it!



My questions include:

* Did these monastic stud farms have a studmaster, and what were their duties?
   * Renton (2019a) mentions the position of *caballerizo mayor,* or head of stables, but in later royal horse breeding programs instead of monastic stud farms, and I'm not sure if their position would be the studmaster.
* What roles the monks play in the breeding? Were they the ones examining, handling, and separating the horses, or would that be the job of grooms (or were the grooms monks)? How did they record pedigrees?
* How much input did the government have on the running of these farms?
   * Bennett writes that the Catholic Spanish king Ferdinand II charged the Carthusian monks with the breeding and pedigree-keeping of the captured Grenadine stud after the conquest of Grenada (2008) but also that the Carthusian ""horse breeding operations remained small and sporadic until much later"" (1998:163). Renton writes of the royal breeding programs of later Spanish kings Charles V and his son Philip II (2019a) (2019b), but I'm not clear how much continuity there was between their royal breeding programs and earlier monastic stud farms.
* What were the breeding practices like? Were separate herds of mares and stallions maintained, and how did the monks keep them? How were horses selected for breeding and what techniques were used (harem mating, assisted live covering, etc.)?
   * If I understand correctly, Renton (2019b) writes that under Philip II's later breeding program, towns would allow select stallions to mate with the town's mares, who would otherwise be kept in a separate herd under the watch of *yegüeros*. However, I think this describes the later breeding policies in towns, not dedicated stud farms.

> Not once, but three times, Baker tried out the “not one inch eastward” formula with Gorbachev in the February 9, 1990, meeting. He agreed with Gorbachev’s statement in response to the assurances that “NATO expansion is unacceptable.” Baker assured Gorbachev that “neither the President nor I intend to extract any unilateral advantages from the processes that are taking place,” and that the Americans understood that “not only for the Soviet Union but for other European countries as well it is important to have guarantees that if the United States keeps its presence in Germany within the framework of NATO, not an inch of NATO’s present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.” (See Document 6)

[Also](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/russias-belief-in-nato-betrayal-and-why-it-matters-today): 

> The idea that the Soviet Union was tricked in 1989-90 is at the heart of Russia’s confrontation with the west

> The current confrontation between Russia and the west is fuelled by many grievances, but the greatest is the belief in Moscow that the west tricked the former Soviet Union by breaking promises made at the end of the cold war in 1989-1990 that Nato would not expand to the east. In his now famous 2007 speech to the Munich Security Conference, Vladimir Putin accused the west of forgetting and breaking assurances, leaving international law in ruins.

...

> What is the basis of the complaint?  

> At one level it narrowly focuses both on verbal commitments made by the US secretary of state James Baker under President George HW Bush and the terms of a treaty signed on 12 September 1990 setting out how Nato troops could operate in the territory of the former East Germany.

> Putin claims that Baker, in a discussion on 9 February 1990 with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, made the promise that Nato would not expand to the east if Russia accepted Germany’s unification.

> The following day Chancellor Helmut Kohl, ambiguous about Germany remaining in Nato after unification, also told Gorbachev “naturally Nato could not expand its territory to the current territory of the GDR”. The promise was repeated in a speech by the Nato secretary general on 17 May, a promise cited by Putin in his Munich speech. In his memoirs, Gorbachev described these assurances as the moment that cleared the way for compromise on Germany.

However, when exactly was the gentlemen's agreement broken according to Russia, and when did the USSR/Russia engage in debatable military activities? Russia intervened militarily in places like [Georgia](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-russia-georgia-conflict-what-happened-and-future-implications-for-us-foreign-policy) and [Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria#Transnistria_War) in the early 90s. Meanwhile, the US intervened militarily in Panama in 1989 and in Iraq in 1991. I don't know to what extent events like the latter two influenced the Russians' attitudes.

From a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace [article](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2022/08/transdniestria-moldova-and-russias-war-in-ukraine?lang=en) on Moldova/Transnistria:

> Transdniestria owes its existence as a quasi-independent entity to the brief war started in 1992 by Moscow-backed separatists who feared that Moldova would become part of Romania after the Soviet Union broke up. The war ended when Russia’s 14th Army, headquartered since the 1950s in what was the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), intervened on behalf of the separatists and defeated the forces of the newly independent Republic of Moldova. 

So, insofar as the NATO/US-Russia/USSR relationship developed for the worse from 1990 to 2004, would you attribute that mainly to factors related to US aggression/provocations, mainly to factors related to Russian aggression/provocations, or would you say that there's no obvious tendency? Either way, what do you consider the main events that contributed to increased tensions/hostility between the two sides?",2024-05-17 22:32:41

history,1ct15a2,Conflations of Casualty Terminology and Another Analytical Fallacy,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1ct15a2/conflations_of_casualty_terminology_and_another/,4,"I noticed that sometimes when discussing battles whether historical or modern, people make mistakes in terminology and come away with incorrect conclusions and perceptions. Likewise, they often fall into a simple analytical fallacy regarding killed vs wounded and come away with incorrect conclusions about the effectiveness of certain weapons vs others.

Let's define some terms.

Wounded In Action (WIA): Anybody who receives a wound. Usually this covers any wound serious enough to warrant medical treatment, so a bruise or scrape or very light graze probably wouldn't be serious enough to qualify.

Seriously Wounded: Anybody who receives a wound which takes them out of the fight. Many wounds can be sustained without necessarily making a person ineffective as a soldier, but this class covers more serious ones which are either debilitating or life threatening. Either way, a soldier who is seriously wounded probably won't be fighting for days to weeks or even months.

Killed In Action (KIA): Self-explanatory.

Missing In Action (MIA): Anybody who cannot be accounted for. In most cases, MIA individuals have been taken prisoner, deserted, or are dead.

Irretrievable/Irrecoverable Casualty/Losses: Anybody who is permanently incapacitated as far as fighting goes. This includes KIA and for practical purposes MIA, but also include anybody who receives wounds which make them incapable of returning to the fight - amputees, people with brain damage, spinal damage, etc.

Casualty: Anybody who is WIA, MIA, or KIA.

I frequently see casualty being conflated with KIA. This is not correct. As a rule of thumb for any KIA there will be between 2 and 10 WIA. These numbers vary depending on the conflict, weapons used, armor used, availability of medical care, and so on. When a force has ""100,000 casualties"" it doesn't have 100,000 KIA, it likely has a few tens of thousands KIA and the rest are WIA.

Now, I'd like to highlight a fallacy I see when people are discussing how deadly certain weapons are or how effective certain armors are. Here's an example from another Reddit thread discussing Napoleonic weaponry.

[About what percentage of the Revolutionary War and Napoleonic War's casualties were caused by melee combat vs ranged combat? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7yl3qj/about_what_percentage_of_the_revolutionary_war/)

>Looking at a larger sample of veterans admitted to the Invalides in 1715, Corvisier arrived at the following breakdown of wounds:

>71.4 % from firearms

>15.8 % from swords

>10.0 % from artillery

>2.8 % from the bayonet

>According to another sample taken (in 1762) in Invalides;

>69 % of the wounded were wounded by musket balls

>14 % by sabers

>13 % by artillery

>2 % by bayonets

I've seen commentators rely on the same data on Reddit and elsewhere to conclude that the ""king of battle,"" artillery, was only responsible for 10% of casualties on the Napoleonic battlefield.

This is a fallacy based on the conflation of WIA and casualties. It causes the assumption that the WIA and KIA rates are the same for these weapons, which is a poor assumption. There are two glaring issues. First a little context for those who are unfamiliar.

Napoleonic-era artillery was composed of cannons/guns and howitzers. Guns fired round shot which were usually solid iron balls or canister shot which were packages of many small iron or lead balls. Round shot acted like a massive bullet which could also bounce, tearing through any men in its path. Fired at a line it could kill two or three men at a time but fired at a dense column it could kill a dozen or more. Howitzers fired shells filled with powder and a fuse and they would ideally explode in the air just above their target to wound via fragments of the shell. Howitzers could also fire canister. Fragmentation and small balls can easily wound someone without killing them. Round shot on the other hand is very likely to kill sooner than wound. It will go straight through the body, producing nearly instant lethal damage to the torso and head or else ripping off limbs. Limbs ruined by round shot could be amputated and cleaned up, but surgeons were in short supply and someone whose femoral artery got ripped open by round shot probably couldn't make it to a surgeon anyways. That is to say, I would expect round shot wounds to be deadly in short order and unless the individual wounded was of importance evacuation to the surgeons to be unlikely in the midst of a battle.

So, round shot victims would inherently be under-represented in a surgeon's tent.

Next, to address canister shot. As stated earlier, canister shot was a shotgun-like blast of dozens of metal balls. Sometimes these were special large diameter balls. At other times these were indistinguishable from musket balls. I suppose in some cases it's possible to distinguish whether an individual was fired at by a cannon or a musket, but canister shot had a range in the hundreds of meters and if a company is under fire from both enemy muskets and canister shot, who's to say whether a man was hit by a ball fired by a musket or a cannon?

In other words, I suspect many canister wounds could have been written off as wounds caused by muskets.

Coming back to the collected statistics we see:

1. They are unreliably because there may be a conflation between canister shot and musketry wounds.
2. As far as ""casualties"" go round shot will be greatly undercounted due to its very high likelihood of killing rather than wounding anybody it hit.

There was a similar analytical fallacy made in WW1. When soldiers were issued with helmets to protect against artillery fragmentation, there were reports that head wounds greatly increased. Someone might conclude that helmets somehow made things more dangerous for the infantry but the truth was just the opposite: The men who would have once been killed by hits to the head were now ""merely"" wounded.

So, please be careful not to conflate casualties with any subcategory and also question how statistics are generated and what they mean in their context.",2024-05-16 01:16:34

history,1cqepdt,"What were the real consequences of the Nuremberg Tribunal declaring the SS a criminal organization in 1946 for its ordinary members? Were there cases of prosecution on the basis of guilt-by-association only, regardless of proofs of participation in crimes?",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1cqepdt/what_were_the_real_consequences_of_the_nuremberg/,4,"I am having an online dispute with one pal over the legal aspects of the Nuremberg Trials right now. We are trying to find out if the principle of the presumption of guilt was applied to all SS membersby the Tribunal but seems like we are both lacking evidence. My point is that it was applied and here is why:

During our discussion, I surprisingly found the following wording in [the Judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal of October, 1946](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judorg.asp#ss), in the section dedicated to ‘The Accused Organizations: 

>*“Tribunal declares to be criminal within the meaning of the Charter* ***the group composed of those persons who had been officially accepted as members of the SS as enumerated in the preceding paragraph\**** ***who became or remained members of the organisation with knowledge that it was being used for the commission of acts declared criminal by Article 6 of the Charter or who were personally implicated as members of the organisation in the commission of such crimes,*** ***excluding, however, those who were drafted into membership by the State in such a way as to give them no choice in the matter, and who had committed no such crimes.*** *The basis of this finding is the participation of the organisation in war crimes and crimes against humanity connected with the war; this group declared criminal cannot include, therefore, persons who had ceased to belong to the organisations enumerated in the preceding paragraph prior to 1st September, 1939.”*

*\* “all persons who had been officially accepted as members of the SS including the members of the Allgemeine SS, members of the Waffen SS, members of the SS Totenkopf Verbaende and the members of any of the different police forces who were members of the SS”*, except for the so-called SS riding units, and the SD, which was dealt with separately.

While the beginning of the paragraph seems to be very clear about the collective guilt of all SS members, including those who just had knowledge of its crimes, I have never heard of people being prosecuted simply for membership in the organization. At the same time, a number of open sources indicates that the exception for those whose membership was involuntary was [used](https://www.karamuzejs.lv/lkm/latvian-legion-controversial-points) by defense attorneys in disputes over the criminal status of Baltic SS legions’ members, so, as far as I understand, the principle of collective guilt itself was never questioned. Thus, questions arise about about the enforcement of the Tribunal’s decisions in this part. Actually, I would split my title question down into two separate questions:

1. There seems to be a contradiction between the beginning of the paragraph, which establishes collective criminal liability for members of the SS, and its end, which exempts those who did not commit crimes from liability. This may even sound a bit absurd, but only if we look at it from the perspective of the presumption of innocence. However, if we use the optics of the presumption of guilt, it starts to look quite logical: SS members are presumed guilty until they can prove that they membership was involuntary or they did not commit any crimes. So, the question is am I right to understand that the principle of the presumption of guilt was applied to all SS members and thus the judgment implied that all of them (tens of thousands of people at the moment) should be prosecuted for the membership? I found [an article](https://www.scotusblog.com/2017/07/symposium-lessons-nuremberg/) by Beth Van Schaack, the US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, indicating that the theory really was that *“any individual member of one of the criminal organizations would face a presumption of guilt”*, but I’m not sure if this interpretation is absolutely correct. Were the presumption of guilt really applied?
2. If yes, what real consequences did it have for SS members? I mean not for high-profile individuals, but for those ordinary members who were obviously neither Nazi leaders nor complicit in war crimes. Were they tried in national courts, so we probably haven’t heard of these cases due to their insignificance? Or maybe they were brought to justice selectively, say, only when they came into attention in specific cases? Or perhaps there were special by-laws giving that exempted them from serving actual prison sentences, while still recognizing them criminals? Were there people charged simply for the fact they were members of the SS?

Would be grateful if you respond with references to specific court documents, legislative acts or analytical papers/scientific works/historical books based on them.

They are only what is in the film's gunfight scene. They are separated by two categories. The first are the objective inaccuracies: what cannot be argued, due to reliable testimony or the coroner's report. The second are the less reliable inaccuracies: we don't know exactly what happened, but it most likely wasn't what was shown.

\[The movie scene\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpEkaGJnkAk&t=226s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpEkaGJnkAk&t=226s)

First, the objective errors.

1. The Earps were not walking all together in a straight line. It was two-by-two, with Virgil and Wyatt in the front, and Doc and Morgan in the back.
2. Doc Holliday should have been wearing a gray coat and hat, as opposed to black.
3. The cowboys' wardrobe does not match the history. Frank and Tom McLaury were wearing buckskin pants, which was noted in the coroner's report. Tom McLaury’s wardrobe was recorded in the coroner’s report as a blue shirt, black vest, and a hat with a silver rimband. All of which were absent. Furthermore, the day was blustery and cold, so all of the cowboys should have been wearing dusters or some other coat.
4. For some reason, the Earps round the corner of Fly’s Boarding House twice.
5. At some point, one of the Earps said to Doc Holliday ""Let them have it"", to which Doc responded ""Alright"". They never did this in the film.
6. Johnny Behan met them much earlier, when they rounded the street corner.
7. Behan is shown ducking into Fly’s Photography Studio. That building was actually behind the vacant lot. The correct building should have been Fly’s Boarding House, which actually bordered the lot and was the true building Behan went into. Though, the exterior of the building matches the boarding house better than the small studio.
8. The vacant lot should be about a third the size of the movie lot. There was no fence separating the lot from the O.K. Corral. As well, all the stable accouterments in the movie lot were not there, leaving the vacant lot exactly that: vacant.
9. Fly's Boarding House is depicted accurately, but the building on the other side of the lot was a house owned by William Harwood. Whatever that building was in the movie, it didn't represent the way the small pre-manufactured cottage really looked.
10. A couple of witnesses took refuge and watched the gunfight from Addie Bourland’s dress shop across the street, including Addie Bourland herself. But in the film, the building across the street is under construction.
11. Tom McLaury is correctly shown with a horse, but Frank should have one as well.
12. The bearded cowboy wearing blue is credited as Johnny Barnes, which is confirmed later. The real Barnes had nothing to do with the gunfight, and it causes the exclusion of Billy Claiborne, who was actually there.
13. The Earps are seen walking forward up until the cowboys go for their guns. In reality, the Earps had stopped in their positions once they got to the lot.
14. Doc Holliday did not advance on the cowboys on his own. He stayed out on the street with the shotgun. Likewise, he did not remove his duster once he had the shotgun out, or anytime during the gunfight.
15. Virgil’s exact words were “Hold! I don’t mean that!” before the first shots, possibly (and probably) in an attempt to stop his brothers and Doc.
16. The Earps are seen firing at Frank midway through the fight, who is still in the middle of the lot halfway through the battle, until he collapses again. By this point in the gunfight, Frank almost certainly was up and trying to get out of the vacant lot. He was seen leading his horse towards Fremont Street, where he would eventually die.
17. Tom McLaury, after he was shot by Doc Holliday, ran to the end of the block until collapsing against a telegraph pole on the street corner. He is never seen running away in the film.
18. The shot that hits Virgil hits him in the wrong leg.
19. The angle of Morgan's wound is considerably off. The shot ripped across both of his shoulder blades, meaning that the shooter was to Morgan’s side. Billy in the film shoots Morgan from the front.
20. Billy Clanton is shot far too many times. In reality, he was only hit twice in the final volley.
21. Once Billy was gunned down in the film, he was basically down for the count. The truth can be stranger than fiction, as Billy really hit the wall of the Harwood House, landed in a sitting position, and just kept shooting until he ran out of ammo. He did not lose consciousness and die until well after the gunfight was over.
22. The whole bit with Ike stealing a gun and shooting out the window? Yeah, none of that happened.
23. Doc is seen wielding two revolvers in the film. He only brought one to the actual gunfight. He may have had a Derringer on him, but he never used it in the fight if he did.
24. The confrontation between Frank and Doc should have been in the middle of the street, with the two of them much further away from each other. As well, Frank grazed Doc in the hip, causing him to exclaim, “I’m shot through!”. It isn’t shown in the film.
25. Frank is seen bearing a wound to his shoulder in the film. In actuality, he only suffered two throughout the gunfight. He took Wyatt’s shot to the gut, and Morgan’s shot to the head.
26. Speaking of that head wound, Morgan is seen shooting Frank in the forehead. The coroner found the wound below the right ear and passing through his head. However, as accurately portrayed, Frank died instantly.
27. After Frank McLaury's death, Doc Holliday said ""That sonofabitch has shot me, and I mean to kill him."", speaking of Frank. He does not do this in the film.

And now, things get muddy.

1. No one really knows what the cowboys were doing in the vacant lot when the Earps arrived. Some believe they were waiting to ambush Doc Holliday, who lived in Fly's Boarding House. Others claim that they were simply trying to get out of town. Still others say the group couldn't decide what to do. Whatever their actions, they were not just dawdling in the lot. They were talking and/or preparing when the Earps came.
2. According to the Earps, the cowboys were not all spread out in the lot, but were instead against the wall of the Harwood house. When the confrontation started, it was then that they moved away from the house.
3. Also, Barnes/Claiborne are shown exiting as soon as the Earps arrive. Claiborne in actuality may have stayed up until the shooting started, but no one knows for sure. According to Johnny Behan, he grabbed Claibourne as he went into the boarding house, but again, we’re not sure what happened.
4. This also causes the other cowboy who leaves early, which we can assume to be Wesley Fuller, to leave once the guns come out. In reality, Fuller was seen by the Earps, but left first.
5. While nobody can entirely agree on where each Earp brother stood, it is agreed that Morgan should have been in Virgil’s place, on the west side of the group. Wyatt should have been close to or up against the boarding house for reasons we’ll get to in a little bit, and Doc should have been out on the street in the back of the group.
6. The phrase Virgil utters to try and disarm the cowboys is accurate to Wyatt’s testimony, but the general consensus is that he said: “Throw up your hands. I want your guns.” , which corresponds to his own testimony.
7. The cause of the gunfight was not Doc Holliday winking, but was actually Holliday cocking the shotgun. It was this that made the cowboys reach for their weapons.
8. It is unclear if there was a moment where everyone hovered over their guns, but if there was, it didn’t take that long.
9. Almost everyone’s gun is correct, but in the movie, Wyatt pulls out a long Colt called a Buntline Special. It is unknown if Wyatt ever really owned this gun, much less used it in the confrontation. In addition, he said he put the gun in his coat pocket, which would have been much harder to do with a longer weapon. He probably used a wood-handled Smith and Wesson 1869, the same model that Virgil had.
10. The tradition of revolvers was to leave the hammer on an empty chamber in case the gun jostled, causing it to go off. Therefore, most of the participants should have only fired five shots out of their six-shooters, unless they threw an extra bullet in for the occasion. (My bets would be on Frank McLaury to do that.)
11. The most reliable testimony from the gunfight, that of the Earp brothers, said that Wyatt and Billy fired the first two shots. This was corroborated by others, but we can't be sure.
12. According to Wyatt's testimony, the film correctly shows Wyatt firing first and hitting Frank in the gut, but his and Billy Clanton’s shots were simultaneous. It took a moment for everyone else to start shooting.
13. Wyatt testified that only four shots were fired before Ike Clanton ran to him. In those shots, Frank and Billy should each have been hit once, and no more.
14. Morgan Earp is seen hitting Billy in the first volley, which would be correct. However, it most likely was the shot to Billy’s wrist, which would not have knocked him to the ground.
15. The reason that Wyatt is placed next to the boarding house is because, according to his testimony, when he grappled with Ike Clanton, he threw him around the corner of the building. He also did this before saying “This fight has commenced. Go to fighting or get away.” Wyatt spoke those words while his revolver was in Ike’s face.
16. Tom McLaury is shown with a revolver, like most adaptations of this event. However, the general consensus is that Tom was unarmed. He had checked his pistol into a hotel beforehand, as was custom, and no gun was found on his body. Most of the testimony that says Tom was armed was from the Earp brothers. However, due to the smoke, the chaotic movements, and the fact that Billy and Frank were shooting around him, it is inferred that a bullet from Frank or Billy was mistakenly believed to be from Tom.
17. This changes the manner of his death. He is seen in the film firing his pistol until Doc scares his horse away with a shotgun blast, then using the remaining ammo to kill Tom. In reality, Tom was seen frantically trying to get a Winchester rifle out of the scabbard on the saddle when the horse either bucked or was nicked by a bullet. This caused Tom to be left open for Doc to blast him with both barrels.
18. Billy Clanton is shown dying in a volley from Wyatt and Doc. No one knows if such a volley really happened or if the shots that killed him were isolated. However, Doc probably only contributed one or two shots, and Virgil was likely the other man to kill Billy.

Adennum: The history behind the second category's notes are less firm, but still more viable than what the film portrays. What is written above is informed by the sources. Many people have drawn different conclusions about what happened that day on October 26th, 1881, all from the same information. I recommend you read/watch up and do the same.

I’m A.J. Jacobs. I’m an author. I wrote a book several years ago called “The Year of Living Biblically” about following the rules of the Bible as literally as possible. 

My new book is a semi-sequel to that, and is called “The Year of Living Constitutionally.” I try to understand our Founding Document by following its original 1789 meaning.

I bore my musket on the Upper West Side of New York.

I gave up social media in favor of writing pamphlets with a quill pen.

I agreed to quarter some soldiers in my apartment.

The book is (I hope) entertaining, but it also has a serious purpose: To explore how we should interpret this 230-year-old document. How much should we stick to the original meaning, and how much should we evolve the meaning?   
I do a deep dive into democracy, SCOTUS, originalism, and much more.

Booklist calls it ""fascinating  and necessary"" and Harvard's Laurence Tribe says ""everyone should read it.""

I have also written some other books, such as

“Thanks a Thousand” — where I went around the world and thanked a thousand people who had anything to do with my morning cup of coffee.

“The Know-It-All” — where I read the Encyclopedia Britannica (when it still existed in physical form)

“Drop Dead Healthy” — where I tried to be the healthiest person alive.

“It’s All Relative” — where I tried to throw a family reunion for eight billion of my cousins.

history,1bq5voa,"Yes, but what does the historical documentation say about The Ark of the Covenant?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1bq5voa/yes_but_what_does_the_historical_documentation/,18,"The Ark of the Covenant  
  
The Ark of the Covenant, is mostly known as 'the Lord’s' mightiest biblical weapon ever or God's laser beams of doom from Raiders of the Ark . . . as it happens the mightiest weapon part is kind of true but, perhaps, not in quite the way some seem to imagine it in terms of a holy rocket-launcher.  
  
Portable shrines modelled on the original Ark were quite common across much of medieval Europe with examples being taken on expeditions or directly into battle on numerous occasions. Two of these replica Arks or ‘house-shaped’ reliquaries appear in the Bayeux tapestry; the Breac Maodhóg is a surviving example of a reliquary from among those carried into battle in medieval Ireland; and the Morgan Bible’s use of the imagery of the Crusades depicts the establishment of the Ark in Jerusalem.  
  
Clearly, there is evidence of a tradition of the Ark being linked to conflict and battle. This at times involved a practice of carrying the Ark round an army three times, but there are no descriptions or images of either jets of blinding light or flaming unbelievers. The Ark or at least a consecrated replica is set up or ‘established’ prior to battle, but any action or effect it may have seems to be manifest in the battle and its outcome rather than the Ark itself physically slaying or striking down anyone.  
  
A bit of wander round the Bible and the Litany of Loreto may help to explain why it was thought important to take an Ark into battle. These sources offer descriptions of the nature of the original Ark containing Christianity’s moral code in the form of the tablets detailing the commandments. Starting with the bible we find the ‘Ark of the Covenant’ re-appeared in the temple when the Lady returns to the holy of holies (Rev. 11.19–12.1). Her title ‘Ark of the Covenant’ is preceding by the title ‘House of gold’, domus aurea, which, according to the language of the temple, indicates the holy of holies.  
  
The holy of holies can be understood by considering the role of the Lady and from there the nature of the holy of holies. In the Wisdom of Solomon 7.26 Mary is described as the spotless mirror of the power or Glory of God, speculum . . . Dei maiestatis. In the Litany of Loreto the title, Mirror of Justice, speculum iustitiae, is applied. The Greek text has this as the spotless mirror of the ‘working’ of God. In Greek or Hebrew this justice is righteousness, which in its Hebrew context, describes exactly the role of wisdom. Righteousness was the action that brought peace, šalom, and Wisdom joined all things together, held them in harmony, ἁρμόζουσα (LXX Proverbs 8.30). Mirror of Righteousness’, the One who shows how God works to bring peace, fits well alongside Wisdom 7.26: reflection of eternal light, mirror of the working of God, image of his goodness.  
  
Mary as the speculum iustitiae links her to this form of Wisdom and takes us into the imagery of the Ark as Mary is connected to the ‘seat of Wisdom’. It was not the seat on which Wisdom sat, but was Wisdom herself. The throne in the holy of holies ‘was’ the Lady, and the one enthroned there was her son.  
  
In the Akathistos Hymn we find: ‘A throne for the King’ (Ikos 1); ‘All-holy chariot of him who rides upon the cherubim’ (Ikos 8). In the Kanon of the Akathist she is: ‘Fiery throne of the Almighty’ (Ode 1, Troparion); ‘Fiery chariot of the Word’ (Ode 5, Troparion); and ‘Chariot of the spiritual Sun’ (Ode 7, Troparion). Mary is also the throne chariot in the holy of holies, as seen by Ezekiel, (Ezek. 1.3), and recorded in Ezekiel 1 and 10.  
  
The gold chariot throne found in the original tabernacle, and the temples of Jerusalem, (that represented creation and were divided between the visible and invisible worlds by the veil). Within this scheme the holy of holies, with the golden chariot throne, was the invisible world of God and Mary, holding the Child on her lap, was seen as the throne of Wisdom manifest in the Child.  
  
The Ark’s Mercy Seat clearly fits with the description of the throne and details on the cloud above the Ark also connect up. The veil, made with the colours of the four elements, represents matter and serve to screen the throne from the material world. In (Job 26.9). ‘He encloses the face/ presence of the throne and spreads upon it his cloud’. Clearly, the throne is in a cloud placing the holy of holies beyond what can be seen as time and matter.  
  
In the Hebrew Scriptures, the Lord came to the holy of holies in a cloud, Mary is identified as an ‘all-bright cloud that unceasingly overshadows the faithful’ (Ode 6, Troparion); and Jesus is described as ‘the One seated in Glory on the throne of the Godhead, Jesus . . . who has come on a cloud of light’ (Ode 4, Irmos).  
  
The cloud covered the tent of meeting/witness when the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Exod. 40.34). A cloud, which was the Glory, also filled the temple when it was consecrated (1 Kgs 8.10–11). King David described the Lord coming from the temple to help him, carried by a thick bright cloud (2 Sam. 22.7, 12–13/ Ps. 18.6, 11–12).  
  
The cloud frequently accompanied the Lord: appearing to Moses on Sinai (Exod. 19.9); over the tabernacle when the Israelites were in the desert (Num. 9.15–23); and to Aaron over the Ark in the holy of holies (Lev. 16.2). There was also a pillar of cloud by day and flame by night to guide the people through the wilderness (Exod. 13.21–22), and the Lord arrived at the tent of meeting/witness in the pillar of cloud that stood at the door of the tent (Deut. 31.15).  
  
In Proverbs 8 Wisdom is set beside the Creator as the material world is made (Prov. 8.22), but she also dances before him in the world of human beings (Prov. 8.31). This implies an upper and a lower Wisdom, ‘united’ and ‘separated’.  
  
While an Ark or shrine, a House of Gold, containing the essence of a moral code and representative of a temple/ tabernacle supporting a cloud of wisdom may seem a curious choice of weapon that’s what appears to have been going on. Other relics, such as a saint’s bone/s, were also taken along in reliquaries, but the Arks or house shrines, (sometimes said to contain other relics), were front and centre. Clearly this might have been thought useful in terms of trying to convince troops the Lord was on their side and so boost morale. However, wisdom plays an obvious and significant role in most battles simply in terms of strategy, which is reliant on knowing as much as possible about the battlefield, your opponent and your own forces.  
  
In the Litany of Loreto, Mary is described as ‘Tower of the beloved’ and ‘Tower of Ivory’, with both images taken from the Song of Songs (4.4 and 7.4 respectively), The Tower was recorded in Jewish tradition as the holy of holies, the place where the prophets stood to receive their revelations (Isa. 21.8; Hab. 2.1). In the context of a battlefield, the ‘wisdom of foresight’ or intelligence gathering makes a whole lot more sense in terms of affecting a huge number of troops as compared to a few lightning bolts from the sky.  
  
It may have been inspiring to parade a surrogate Ark before a medieval battle, but there is possibly a risk of missing a broader perspective on ‘the battle’ in so far as it makes more sense for an item containing a tablet stating ‘thou shalt not kill’ to concern wisdom and battles on the levels of faith or psychology. Christianity is about Christian values and the idea of Jesus wandering around with a divine bazooka plain isn’t a good fit.  
  
However, applying wisdom to many situations does fit with both military and other ‘battles’ and connects with the Christian tradition or message the Ark is all about explaining. The Bayeux tapestry shows two Arks used within the story arc of a conquest, but they appear in a scene where an oath is taken.  
  
The titles applied to Mary are consistent with a Christian ‘combat’ or ‘battle’ as she is also the ‘Heavenly Ladder by which God came down’ (Ikos 2) and through title and association the Lady and Wisdom form the related tree of life. Consequently, we can recognise the Ark as the laws of the tablets and temple used to ascend the ladder or tree to the cloud of Wisdom above the Ark.  
  
The claimed contents of the original Ark included Aaron’s rod and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Mary is the ‘Mystical staff that blossomed’ (Ode 7, Troparion), a reference to Aaron’s rod that bore blossoms and almonds (Num. 17.8–11). To complete a set there is also the pot of mana said to be contained within the Ark. The pot of mana, cauldron or womb is consistently found as a symbol of primordial creation concerning birth or rebirth involving wisdom and sustenance.",2024-03-28 20:32:27

 Fake Second World War soldier honored: 'Thousands of lives saved'

 A real medal for a fake army.  Soldiers of the Ghost Army have been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor of the American parliament.  By deception they fooled the German opponent during the Second World War.

 About 1,300 soldiers helped the American army look stronger on the front lines in Europe.  They were often art academy students who used their talent to fool the enemy.

 To pretend they were a complete army, they set up hundreds of inflatable tanks, paraded around in generals' uniforms and threw fake signals into the airwaves.  ""We put on a show to fool the enemy,"" 100-year-old Seymour Nussenbaum remembers his work.

 Nussenbaum received the medal together with two former colleagues.  Together with four others, they are the last survivors of the ghost army.

 ￼APSeymour Nussenbaum during the ceremony

 At the ceremony, House Speaker Mike Johnson said their tricks ""saved 15,000 to 30,000 lives.""  For example, the American troops crossing the Rhine in 1945 encountered less resistance because the German troops had been regrouped against the fake troops.

 Rick Beyer, who campaigned for recognition, says the danger to the fake army was indeed real.  ""It takes a special kind of courage to project strength without having it. Drawing the enemy's fire so that others are spared. Dangerous work, not for the faint of heart.""  Four members of the group were killed in the battle.

 Another veteran took it as a compliment when the enemy attacked.  “We were apparently successful, because the Germans shot at us,” Bernard Bluestein, 100, told the Washington Post.  “They were convinced we were real.”

 American inflatable tanks to deceive Nazis

 The Ghost Army was used in the Allied landings in Africa in 1941 and 1942, in the battle in Italy a year later and for the D-Day landings in 1944. That same year it helped General Patton fill a gap in his line near the city  Metz.  Beyer: ""They held out for eight days, which is an awfully long time for a deception.""

 Because the tricks worked so well, the ghost army remained top secret after the war.  Its existence was not revealed until 1996.  Many of the members had not told their families anything in all this time.

 Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster praised their dedication.  ""I thought the best part was that man who only told his family: 'I blew up tanks'.""

 But inflatable tanks didn't just play a role during World War II.  A year ago we made this report about the role of inflatable weapons in the war in Ukraine:

history,1bgb4fz,Wondering about ownership & daily functioning of medieval alehouses and taverns,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1bgb4fz/wondering_about_ownership_daily_functioning_of/,32,"I'm most interested in about the 1400's in England. Early Tudor and pre-Tudor times or so. 

How were alehouses (or perhaps taverns) laid out? Are there any records of sites of these that have survived to today? What rooms would they have had? What things would have been (like objects) and been done (like activities) in these rooms? Were the buildings themselves often 2 stories? Did most have their own dedicated well? How much did they rely on buying drinks by the barrel/cask from others vs an alewife making it by themselves? Did alewives often have employees (or like their sister helping them) if their business was profitable enough? How often were such buildings & businesses owned by women vs owned by their husbands? If a man owned them, would his wife make some of the ale/etc, or would she have been considered well to do and spent her time more ordering others around to get the work done? 

If a woman was an alewife, then how much of her day would that occupation often take up? 3hr, 10hrs, or more? 

If they also served bread, buns, or meat pies, would they have gotten through the (licensing) trouble of having their own oven, or did they often still take everything to the town baker? 

What I've read before seems to paint an alehouse often more akin to a few friends coming over to your house for a drink, except the woman of the house would have made that drink herself. Compare contrast a tavern where you could rent part of a bed if you were traveling and would probably be served wine instead of (functionally) weak beer. 

Were they often wattle and daub construction? 

Do we have surviving first-hand / primary source accounts of what it would have been like to walk into one of these establishments as a customer? What about as a worker? How many people were needed to run an establishment that served a few dozen customers or more each night? 

I once read a source that talked about how women in a tavern during the day were usually there to talk business, while women there at night were usually there to sell their bodies. Would such activities happen on the premises? Were there rooms for that? 

I've read that there were laws requiring prostitutes to wear certain things to show that their services were for sale to others. Were there any trends of what these were or was it simply random seeming / varied too much from village to village / town to town? 

My two main sources for this so far have been [Alcohol, Sex, and Gender in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe](https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Gender-Medieval-Modern-History/dp/0312234147) (I found a copy in a library many years ago, stayed and read for hours) and [The Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112894/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6ZBRJC832NUZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3Q7zzfeA_Tfa_8UsHCrsfqPvhcjOxO5gAdv2A6drA0Hu-Dcd70hzuSivdBrTA0IQGjkSTsQZuqSSO8hQxxOJ8OO8fvNQw8xYWmAxaky2WApFpSeQdJ2wTME-g11Ta270u6AU4zJhFe9KFF_TH2CasAuTEQCx56qesSj3hkMDIqBMJOxlMblQRxbAXUpSVbeJkmcWgROic85fgCCzqXaUs5GBX20sAPuHk3EY1Kf46TU.Mse371ciVehbKjiDFi0P_vm5F1Ot1uetOlCCTTRElrU&dib_tag=se&keywords=time+travel%27s+guide+to+medieval+england&qid=1710608558&s=books&sprefix=time+travel%27s+guide+to+medieval+englan%2Cstripbooks%2C210&sr=1-1) (of which I have my own personal copy).

In the latter half of the 20th century, corporate America and the wealthy elite systematically waged a sophisticated campaign of influence to reshape the political economic system to favor their interests at the expense of labor and the working class. No unwitting convergence, the evidence clearly demonstrates an intentional, multi-pronged offensive by capital to consolidate power and redistribute wealth upward.

**The Mobilization of Corporate Force**

The 1971 Powell Memorandum served as a virtual blueprint for this initiative. The future Supreme Court Justice explicitly instructed corporations to vigorously promote pro-business policies and shift public attitudes to counter perceived anti-capitalist sentiment. Corporate interest groups swiftly answered the call, forming the Business Roundtable, the Heritage Foundation, and an constellation of think tanks devoted to championing free market fundamentalism.

Simultaneously, the University of Chicago economists led by Milton Friedman cultivated a re-invigorated strain of academic theory elevating unfettered capitalism and deregulation above other policy considerations. Legal scholars advanced complementary concepts prioritizing ""economic efficiency"" over other regulatory purposes through the law and economics movement.

Intellectual bastions were erected to provide theoretical justification for corporatism. This fortification of ""free market"" ideals created an formidable axis of corporate lobby groups, partisan think tanks, and pro-business academics aligned in pushing for a rightward ideological realignment favoring capital over labor. No longer would stakeholder interests be balanced - shareholder value was now the preeminent imperative.

[https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/1/](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/1/)

**Capturing the Policymaking Apparatus**

With economic crises of the 1970s creating a policy vacuum, this alliance accelerated efforts to capture the policy making apparatus. Corporate PACs could directly bankroll political campaigns. Lobbyists reshaped regulatory bodies to be subservient to industry interests. Conservative legal movements including the Federalist Society cultivated a pro-corporate judicial philosophy.

When Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency, this momentum was rendered into a comprehensive power realignment. Reagan's administration slashed taxes for the wealthy while gutting organized labor. It deregulated finance, telecommunications, and other key industries. Every cabinet department privileged business priorities over worker rights, consumer protections, or environmental custodianship.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1988/10/02/the-legacy-of-deregulation/c553674b-8bd2-436e-9be7-7de95f798fbb/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1988/10/02/the-legacy-of-deregulation/c553674b-8bd2-436e-9be7-7de95f798fbb/)

Over subsequent decades, this paradigm ossified into institutionalized pillars of corporatism. Legislators repeatedly revoked regulations for their industry donors. Tax policies turbo-charged wealth stratification with generational repercussions. Federal judicial appointments enshrined an economic fundamentalism devoid of countervailing values. What was once a process of democratic policy making became a seamless conveyor belt of rent-extraction for elite interests.

history,19d9csz,"Mohism (Moism), the School of Modernity",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/19d9csz/mohism_moism_the_school_of_modernity/,10,"I want to talk about Mohism.

**Introduction:** After the West Chou Dynasty, the beginning of East Chou Dynasty does not look good. In fact, the East Chou Dynasty is really a shadow of its previous glory. China soon entered the era known as Spring & Autumn (春秋), and after further collapse of Chou Dynasty's system (禮樂) and with a more destabilized Middle Plain, we enter the Warring State (戰國). As the world around them begin to collapse, with mass murders and endless wars, the philosophers and the intellectuals of the era begin to believe that a new philosophy must be established to help bring the Middle Plains back to its former stable status. Thus, emerged the Hundred Schools of Thought (諸子百家).

Among the hundred schools (""Hundred"" is a common metaphor in Chinese, it means ""a lot"" here, not exactly 100.), the most famous ones were: **Confucianism**, **Taoism**, **Legalism**, **Mohism**, **Agriculturalism**, **Logicianism** (School of Names), **Naturalism** (School of Yin and Yang), School of Military, **School of Diplomacy**\[F1\], School of Minor Talks\[F2\], School of Medicine, and **Syncretism**\[F3\]. Texts in bold means they're what Chinese world often refer to as 九流十家 (The nine styles and ten schools, the one extra school is the School of Minor Talks, which is not included in the nine styles.)

(yes, Confucianism is not a religion, EU4 got this so stupidly wrong.)

**Main Character:** The man behind the Mohism is the Mozi (zi 子 is a respectful way to refer to a wise teacher. His real name is unknown, but believed to be Mo Di). In his early days, he learnt about Confucianism, but he was not impressed with all the complicated class systems and wasteful behavior towards human resources. Like many other philosophers, he went on his journey to promote his ideology to the kings of countries. But one thing made the Mohism group different--they're expert at defending sieges, making them really popular among the kings, who seek for their military assistance.

**Core Ideas:** There are 10 main ideas in Mohism.

**兼愛 (The Equal Love)** promotes the idea of loving and caring all people equally. The idea of treating people equally is uncommon at the time. On top of that, the other ideology that was as popular as Mohism, Confucianism, promotes that people have different classes and levels, and thus should be treated differently.

The Equal Love is not just ordinary respect. It's the idea that promotes you to love everyone equally, have the spirit of sacrifice, and return good deeds with your good deeds.

**尚賢 (Respect the Meritocracy)** promotes the idea of meritocracy. Mozi thinks that there are many intelligent and wise advisors and politicians that can do good deeds to the country, but they are ignored over other factors, like corruption and social classes. It promotes the idea that people of all manner, no matter a farmer or a noble, should be assigned to a good position that they can do best at.

**天志 (The Mandate)** promotes the idea of 天 (literally The Sky, but can be interpreted as The Heaven or The Kingdom Above) is the object that granted the Emperors their right to rule. The philosophy of 天 is ""To love everyone"" and ""Give rewards to good doers and punishment to bad doers."", as mentioned in 《墨子．天志下》. For that, the Emperor (and consequently the judicial system) should therefore love their people and give rewards or punishments with sense of justice.

**非命 (Disbelief of Destiny)** promotes the idea that destiny cannot decide where people will end up at. Mozi claimed that there is no such thing as ""Destiny"" as many people were born in ordinary poor families, but ended up as the ruler of millions through immense hard-work and efforts. Therefore, he promotes that the people should put effort to overturn what they believe as destiny, and seek for a better future.

**節用 (Reduction of Consumption)** promotes the idea that people should use less, therefore waste less. This applies to all social classes, no matter nobles or peasants (though probably more to nobles). Some criticized that this thought will slow the growth of economy due to low consumption.

**非攻 (Against the Invasions)** promotes the idea that invasion is not of good morals, and therefore should not happen. ""Invasion"" (攻) is defined as powerful countries taking over weaker countries, but if the invasion war is targeted as people who have committed crimes or bad morals, it is not invasion, but instead a Punishment (誅). Mozi thinks that killing is not of good morals, and since war will kill hundreds of thousands, it is of really, really bad morals. Mozi is not blindly anti-war however. Instead, the Mohism, as aforementioned, is expert at defensive sieges. Mozi, his students, along with his master-crafted weaponry have helped many countries in their defense against other countries. Even Mozi himself is an experienced military tactician.

**尚同 (Align of the Higher Class)** promotes the idea that if there is no standard, the country cannot have an effective judicial system, as everyone thinks differently without a main idea that everyone shares. The Alignment can happen in all circumstances, as small as in family, and as big as the Mandate and the people. Mozi thinks that the people should align with the Sky, otherwise the Mandate would not bless them, and soon the punishment will come.

**明鬼 (Recognition of Spirits and Gods)** promotes the idea that people should believe the existence of Spirits and Gods. They're a spiritual representation of good morals, telling people that there is always someone watching behind you, and if you don't do good morals, you will certainly be punished--one way or another.

**非樂 (Rejection of Liue)** (禮樂 is a concept that represents the Etiquette and the Music. They're considered the symbol of civilization) promotes the idea that the Country should spend their budget on what does good for the people, instead of meaningless and unneeded etiquette and instruments that eats up a good portion of the country's wealth. Mozi strongly criticized that ""Music only delays what's important"".

**節葬 (Save on Funerals)** promotes the idea that people should stop unnecessarily long and expensive funerals. Back at the time, if your parents deceased, you have to spend **3 entire years** in remembrance of them. During which, you cannot do anything productive. There are similar rules for other relatives, but slightly lighter. The graves are also dug stupidly deep, and perhaps decorated with expensive items. Mozi considers that these rituals will reduce a country's productivity and makes people lose money over the etiquette that the society considers normal.

**Conclusion:** Beside these progressive thoughts that focus more on the material life and economy, Mohism is also famously known for its advancement in **science**. School of Mohism successfully developed the first **logic system** in China. The Book of Mozi (which is mostly about the ideology of Mohism) also covered many aspects, such as **Philosophy**, **Psychology**, **Political Science**, and more. Not only are they cutting-edge on philosophy-related topics, Mozi and his students are also experts at hard science, such as **Physics**. The Book of Mozi has many mentions of Mozi's theories in physics, such as **levers** and **early atomism**. Mozi also have done probably the earliest **pinhole camera** experiment in the world. (光之人，煦若射。下者之人也高，高者之入也下。足蔽下光，故成景於上；首蔽上光，故成景於下。在遠近有端與於光故景庫內也。)

Mozi's progressive political thoughts are also praised, such as his thoughts of encouraging giving opinions (which some consider as the Freedom of Speech). Some considered Mohism as the earliest trace of Democracy in China.

**References**

Sources of Materials: 《墨子》(The Book of Mozi) and its other versions, 《儒家五經》(The Five Classics of Confucianism, 《易經》、《尚書》、《詩經》、《儀禮》、《春秋》) and its other versions, and 《墨辯》(The Debate of Mozi, which is basically 6 parts in the Book of Mozi. They talk about how the logic system works.)

There are probably breakdowns or easier-to-read versions of these on Wikipedia. They're really hard to read even as a native speaker of Chinese/Mandarin.

If you can read Chinese, there are a couple translated version of those classics, one of the most famous is 《左傳》(Zho Zhuan, lit. The Tales of Zho), which explained 《春秋》(Spring and Autumn).

As mentioned above, Mozi did receive criticisms from his progressive thoughts. One of them was the famous philosopher and historian, Xunzi. His ideology is presented in 《荀子》(The Book of Xunzi).

**Footnotes**

F1: 縱橫 means Vertical and Horizontal, which at time were two different diplomatic strategies. Vertical is the idea of unifying smaller countries to resist the Qin, and Horizontal is the idea of Qin allying with smaller countries to take over other small countries.

F2: Minor Talks is translated as ""novel"" and used as ""novel"" in modern Chinese. What they did back in the time was basically taking record of folktales.

F3: Syncretism (雜家)'s main idea is basically taking what's good from other ideologies and avoiding what's bad of other ideologies. After many of the original book records of the ideologies were destroyed, all Schools turned into some degree of Syncretism, since they have to take ideas from other ideologies to fix up the parts they lost.

I made a spreadsheet that provides a summary of uprisings against European colonization of the islands of the South Asian-Pacific region for myself to better understand the history of the area. I think other people may get a lot of benefit from studying this history as well. I made this in my free time so it might not be very polished. If this is not the appropriate sub then I will remove.  
  
I called my spreadsheet “Nusantara Resistance” and I included the modern day nations of Indonesia, Philippines, East Timor, the entire island of Borneo, and the Malaysian peninsula. I think this is the most complete list of revolts, but there were rebellions that were referenced in some documents that I could never find out more about. If anyone knows where to look for more information about any of the revolts I have listed then I would appreciate the links or places to look. If you know of other rebellions or uprisings I can add those as well. The battles and wars have a variety of names, but the names I chose for some of them is partially just my own preference and not any kind of ‘official’ designation   
  
In virtually every one of these rebellions there are large numbers of native peoples fighting on the side of the Europeans, but I focused on the Imperial colonial powers because it seems clear their actions drove the conflicts.  I avoided getting into WW2 because it is such a huge event and better covered by others, and then the Indonesian war of Independence was likewise beyond the scope of what I was doing. I did not purchase any books but instead used open source material available online.  I used Google to translate pages in other languages that I am unable to read, so you may have to do the same if you use my links.   
  
If anyone thinks this information is incorrect or mistranslated, please forgive my ignorance and help me correct or change it. If anything I have included is offensive, please accept my deepest apologies, I mean no disrespect.  Lots of those stories come from websites of local governments or charities within Indonesia or the Philippines.

But good on them.

https://youtu.be/qGEm78eALzE?si=XElN5Tp52JJxVwHL&t=407

Anyone know when they did that or what text it would be described in?


So i found out they have this text called Surya Siddhanta (sun teatrise) that describe the sun and other planets and the stars. So astronomy basically. 

A quick wikipedia search will tell you this text is about 1500 years old and that in this text earth was the center. But wikipedia might not be a good source. So what else is there to find?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta

Well you have this video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQNhQ7wxOvA

Which talks about there being a south polar star aswell as a north polar star, something we dont have today, but we had that 2900 BCE and 12000 BCE.  They also talk about obliquity of earth that it should be 24 degrees but today it is 23,4 degrees. So when was it 24 degrees? 2900 BCE and 12000 BCE. Then they talk about the peak of hemanta which should happen right when earth is at its apoapsis, combined with the above then it could only happen 12000 BCE. Which suggest how old the text is. 

Then we have the question about heliocentricity. 

If you look on this page

https://mathemajik.tripod.com/article/astronomy.html

They say a lot of useful stuff about gravity and such, but they say in the text the sun is referred to as 

>the centre of the spheres

So if you think planets as spheres then you get the idea why they would say that. But its written in the vedas so about 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE old.  They also saw stars as other suns just far far away.

I often see it said that the decision to spare the Emperor was made after the war was over during occupation, however was there more to it than that? 

On August 10th Japan, after much debate within the Supreme War Council the following “acceptance” of the Potsdam Declaration:

>""The Japanese Government are ready to accept the terms enumerated in the joint declaration which was issued at Potsdam on July 26th, 1945, by the heads of the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, and China, and later subscribed to by the Soviet Government, **with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler.”**

I am aware that this condition the Japanese sought was not simply “let us keep the Emperor” and instead an attempt to maintain a degree of sovereignty that the US was not offering. My point of, perhaps confusion, is the US intent regarding the Emperor and their willingness to convey said intent to the Japanese.

According to Truman after the war, it seems that the US intent was clear in regard to Hirohito:

> “Were there any representations made to the emperor that he would be retained?” Truman answered: “**Yes, he was told that he would not be tried as a war criminal and that he would be retained as emperor**.” When asked who made that promise, Truman responded that it was presented “through regular channels.”

Of course, it doesn't appear to be that simple as there is no evidence to suggest he or anyone else sent any kind of message to the Japanese beyond what I can only assume to be the Brynes note which contained the following:

>""With regard to the Japanese Government's message accepting the terms of the Potsdam proclamation but containing the statement, 'with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler,' our position is as follows:  

>""From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms.
> ""The Emperor will be required to authorize and ensure the signature by the Government of Japan and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters of the surrender terms necessary to carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, and shall issue his commands to all the Japanese military, naval and air authorities and to all the forces under their control wherever located to cease active operations and to surrender their arms, and to issue such other orders as the Supreme Commander may require to give effect to the surrender terms.> ""**The ultimate form of government of Japan shall, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, be established by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.**
> ""The armed forces of the Allied Powers will remain in Japan until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are achieved.""

I highlighted the portion of interest as this part is a bit odd compared to the rest. It seems to me to be implying the Emperor would remain as it was fairly understood that the will of the people would not be to have the Emperor tried as a war criminal. This reply created a lot of uncertainty and conflict within the Japanese government and while I may be oversimplifying it by making the suggestion there was any “clear interpretation” by the Japanese, however it appears to me that the Emperor at a minimum interpreted this message as somewhat implicitly confirming that he would remain.

> Hirohito immediately responded that since the Byrnes note referred to the “freely expressed will of the Japanese people” he did not see any problem. If the people still trusted the imperial house, as he thought they would, he did not see any problem. 

And it seems to me that the intent, based on the diary entries of those who formed the Byrnes note or at least discussed it, seems to concur with that interpretation. Truman for instance wrote: 

> Ate lunch at my desk and discussed the Jap offer to surrender which came in a couple of hours earlier. They wanted to make a condition precedent to the surrender. Our terms are ""unconditional."" **They wanted to keep the Emperor we told 'em we'd tell 'em how to keep him, but we'd make the terms.**

This diary entry makes it seem like Truman didn’t have an issue with the retainment of the Emperor as much as making sure it was the US that “told em how to keep him”. This sentiment appears to be shared by Stimson: 

> Byrnes was troubled and anxious to find out whether we could accept this in the light of some of the public statements [demanding ""unconditional"" surrender from Japan] by Roosevelt and Truman. Of course during three years of a bitter war there have been bitter statements made about the Emperor. Now they come to plague us. **Admiral Leahy took a good plain horse-sense position that the question of the Emperor was a minor matter compared with delaying a victory in the war which was now in our hands.""**

> ""The President then asked me what my opinion was and I told him that I thought that **even if the question hadn't been raised by the Japanese we would have to continue the Emperor ourselves under our command and supervision in order to get into surrender the many scattered armies of the Japanese who would own no other authority and that something like this use of the Emperor must be made in order to save us from a score of bloody Iwo Jimas and Okinawas all over China and New Netherlands.** He was the only source of authority in Japan under the Japanese theory of the State…..

>  On the latter I found for once that McCloy was rather divergent from me. He was intrigued with the idea that this was the opportunity to force upon Japan through the Emperor a program of free speech, etc. and all the elements of American free government.

> After all this discussion I called Byrnes on the telephone and discussed the matter with him. He told me he had drafted the answer to the Japanese notice and that he would like me to see it. So I sent over [Stimson's aide Colonel William] Kyle to the Department and got it. **While a compromise, it was much nearer my position than McCloy's** and after a while McCloy agreed that it was good enough from his standpoint. **I thought it was a pretty wise and careful statement and stood a better chance of being accepted than a more outspoken one.**

This to me indicates that those involved were willing to and intend to imply to the Japanese that, while ultimately subject to the Allied authorities, that the Emperor would remain in some form. It also appears like the Emperor felt that was their intent. Pulling directly from Wikipedia: 

> That day, Hirohito informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai (imperial sovereignty) could not be preserved. The Emperor simply replied ""of course.""

Of course Kokutai in its mythical form was not preserved, but the narrow view that the Emperor had adopted was and it seems as if he thought it wouldn’t be, perhaps if he felt he would be executed, then he may have chosen to fight on. 

MacArthur also seemed to not go over with any intent but to use the Emperor, in part due to Fellers an advisor of his who told him:

> An absolute and unconditional defeat of Japan is the essential ingredient for a lasting peace in the Orient. Only through complete military disaster and the resulting chaos can the Japanese people be disillusioned from their fanatical indoctrination that they are the superior people, destined to be overlords in Asia. Only stinging defeat and colossal losses will prove to the people that the military machine is not invincible and that their fanatical leadership has taken them the way to disaster . . . There must be no weakness in the peace terms. **However, to dethrone or hang the Emperor would cause tremendous and violent reaction from all Japanese . . . Hanging the Emperor would be comparable to the crucifixion of Christ to us. All would fight and die like ants. The position of the militarists would be strengthened immeasurably. An independent Japanese army responsible only to the Emperor is a permanent menace to peace. But the mystic hold the Emperor has on the people . . . properly directed need not be dangerous. The Emperor can be made a force for good and peace provided the military clique [around him] . . . is destroyed.**

So with all of that laid out, and perhaps too simply put, was there an “implicit” acceptance or intent prior to occupation to spare the Emperor?",2024-01-12 23:48:28

I've watched the show, even though it's not entirely accurate, but i have done some reading on his story as far as history is concerned, and damn he was a fascinating figure.

From fighting as a gladiator, escaping slavery, starting a slave army. Producing intelligent military successes and nearly taking down the Roman empire. In my mind his story seems comparable to if an escaped British slave of the last several hundred years started a slave army and nearly took down the British empire. That would be an incredible feat.

Onto Spartacus - He was a Thracian who likely was taken in as a slave by the Roman empire, during his time being forced as a soldier for the Romans. He was taken to Capua and trained and fought as a gladiator, after some time escaped with some 30 men and built his slave army. At one point it's thought he might have commanded up to 100k men.

There's the famous battle of mount Vesuvius where he and his men, after being trapped on the mountain, used vines to climb down the side of the mountain discretely and ambush the Romans. This is a really cool scene in the show and appears reasonably accurate to what happened.

That aside, if Spartacus won his final battle and took Rome it would have altered the course of history drastically. The triumvirate with Julius Caesar, Crassus and Pompey would never have happened. 

After the final battle and Spartacus lost, 5000 or so slave soliders were captured and crucified along the apian way. Extremely gruesome, but pretty benign by the Roman standards. 
 
Spartacus was clearly intelligent, physically competent, a great fighter, incredibly brave and held all the qualities I admire in a historical figure. Even though Marcus Crassus defeated him, the Parthians had Crassus killed by pouring liquid gold down his throat, a fine ending for such a man hahah.

In any case, I admire the story of Spartacus. Further along, it was an interesting time, you had Julius Caesar conquering Gaul, starting the Roman empire, creating a string of good and bad, sometimes outright nasty emperor's. Then of course we had Jesus, which was crucified probably about 70 years after Spartacuses slave soldiers were.

Christianity came along and bam, the world changed in a big way. This is an exciting section of history, many important figures not mentioned, such as Cleopatra existed around this period. What do you guys think?

Do you think Spartacus was cool?

In the late 1970s, when he was just 34 years old, a radical young lawyer named Maurice Bishop led a revolution in Grenada, and overthrew a dictator. He became the prime minister, and he governed for four years. 

Bishop was adored by the Grenadian people. Some of them knew him as Comrade Bishop. He identified as a socialist, believing that the government had a responsibility to provide education, health care, and jobs to all Grenadian citizens. But he was also controversial. Bishop spoke out against American imperialism. He was close to Cuban President Fidel Castro, who gave Grenada weapons and military training, and that put Bishop and Grenada right at the center of tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

Ronald Reagan was in his first term as president of the United States, and he did care about Grenada. On March 23rd, 1983, President Reagan delivered a speech from the Oval Office.

“On the small island of Grenada, at the southern end of the Caribbean chain, the Cubans, with Soviet financing and backing, are in the process of building an airfield with a 10,000-foot runway. Grenada doesn't even have an air force. Who is it intended for?” Reagan said in his televised address, which was later nicknamed the ""Star Wars"" speech.

“The rapid buildup of Grenada's military potential is unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110,000 people, and totally at odds with the pattern of other eastern Caribbean states, most of which are unarmed.”

On October 19th, 1983, Bishop was killed. He was shot, execution style, by members of his own army. Seven other people, members of his cabinet and friends, were killed alongside him. The whereabouts of their remains are unknown. In a series two years in the making, we discovered new information about the 40-year-old mystery, including[ the role the U.S. played](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/12/08/grenada-maurice-bishop-missing-remains/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com) in shaping the fate of this Caribbean nation.

We've interviewed more than 100 people, people who witnessed the killings, people who were convicted of the murders, and others who also have a connection to all this — soldiers, diplomats, intelligence officers, even a member of the US Congress.

history,18g1cty,"An interesting historical anecdote that was recorded in a primary source written in the Manchu language about how the women of the horde fought in the war, along with my own English translation",267,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/18g1cty/an_interesting_historical_anecdote_that_was/,14,"**Some background information:**  
  
The time was 1625 CE, it has been seven years since the start of Manchus invasion against China, and the most Chinese lands beyond the great wall had already been subjugated. However, due to the sheer, overwhelming population ratio, it was almost impossible for the Manchus to establish any form of effective administration over the land they conquered, for at this point there were at least 2 million Chinese under their yoke and according to a census conducted some 20 years later, the total adult male population of Manchus was merely 55330.  
  
To better manage the land he conquered, khan Nurhaci of the Manchus decided to establish small colonies (niru) near every major Chinese city, and grant the surrounding land to these colonists in the form of tokso (meaning royal land), hoping that at least most of these city-dwelling Chinese could be kept in check.  
  
In the meantime, China had abandoned its previous war policy of winning through decisive battles, as the Chinese had lost every field battle since the beginning of the war. Instead, a general named Mao Wenlong was sent across the sea with a small contingent of crack troops and established himself on a small Korean island named ka. From there, General Mao started to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Manchus. He found himself in a very advantageous situation, as countless Chinese who hated their Manchu overlords fled from their homes to join his cause. These people, though inferior in warfare, were familiar with the land and had many connections, making them ideal guerrilla fighters. Our story happened during one of these hit-and-run attacks they conducted.  
  
**My translation**  
  
""On the evening of  (May) 27th, Mao Wenlong sent 300 troops to our Šundo colony established in front of Yue Zhou, the Chinese city; hoping to breach its defensive wall. Seeing this, the three women of the colony took action. They positioned their cart against the wall, and the wife of Cinggiyanu, taking the lead, reached the top of the wall by stepping on the cart. Wielding her husband's sword, she rushed towards the enemy and attacked. Inspired by her courage, the other two women also charged, chopping and suppressing the enemy. With this brave tactic, they forced the enemy into flight, driving them away from the wall.  
  
The khan summoned these three women and praised them for their valor. The wife of Cinggiyanu was granted the title of uju jergi beiguwan, first-class colonel. The second woman to join the fight was granted the title of jai jergi beiguwan, second-class colonel and the third woman to join the fight was granted a 1000-men-strong unit to lead. Aside from titles, they received many silk, gifts, silvers, horses, oxen and slaves from the khan. Their names were also made famous across the state.  
  
Cinggiyanu was a mediocre man in the colony, because he was still preparing his bow and arrows while his wife took his sword to attack enemy. How could such woman not be superior to this armor-wearing coward? Reflecting on this event, how could three skirt-wearing women alone defeat the enemy force? I (the author, who is a royal secretary) think it was probably because the goddess (refering to abka hehe, the arch-deity of Manchus mythology, literally means ""the sky lady"") was helping our brilliant khan. She grasped the hearts of the women, and made them to triumph over the enemies.

history,180ubxl,Looking for the first television ads that advertised TVs,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/180ubxl/looking_for_the_first_television_ads_that/,3,"I'm working an an exhibit for the museum I work at about advertising history and how it connects to the pervasion of electricity into everyday life. The scope of the exhibit is the early to mid-20th century.

Basically, the exhibit discusses how electrification became a part of average life due to aggressive advertising techniques that were born in the post-industrial revolution/beginning of the mass-production era. It begins where consumers first had to be convinced (through advertising) that electricity would improve their lives in order to get them to buy into electrification in the first place in the early 20th century, such as [this lightbulb ad](https://nclac.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/lightbulb.jpeg) that shows the different uses for bringing electricity into the home and [this lightbulb ad](https://oldchristmastreelights.com/bills_site/Vintage+Advertising_files/Edison+burning+tree+ad.jpg) that posits that electricity is a safer method of lighting than fire. The exhibit then moves into the electrification craze where everything in the house suddenly became electrified and was therefore ""better"" (think [toasters](https://metvcdn.metv.com/oyL4G-1456252609-embed-toast_side.png), blenders, [hair dryers](https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5397163023_d6bcfa2728_z.jpg), electric shavers, coffee makers, [irons](http://www.oldandinteresting.com/images/waageironad.jpg), etc., and yes, every one of these appliances existed in some form pre-electricity), and continues into the mid-20th century which was full of advertising that sold the idea that electrified items made (women's) chores in the home easier and actually wound up changing the American ideal of a clean or well-kept home (think [vacuums](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/503840277032633062/), [stoves/ovens](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/307300374547223786/), [washer/dryers](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-ikiuocf6r8/content/timeline/1947---Automatic-clothes-washer.jpg), [refrigerators](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Refrigerator-vintage-photos-06.webp), and electric sewing machines). 

The ""ending"" of the exhibit explores how electronics and advertising formed a majorly symbiotic relationship by which they sustained each other when we started exploring the use of advertising over radios, televisions, and telephones. I have found quite a few television ads from the 1940s that illustrate how we formed this relationship, including the [first ever advertisement on television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JenAyMmZ68), but what I am having trouble finding is exactly where we started advertising televisions on television. The earliest advertisements for televisions were [print ads](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uOFW6Srhy54/Wy3CGkPyorI/AAAAAAABdtI/QG8JUZFnlmM4oI4XcxcJh0_dKAJMHbGzgCLcBGAs/s1600/TV%2BAdvertisements%2BFrom%2Bthe%2B1950s%2B%252813%2529.jpg%20alt=), which is obvious because you can't advertise a new technology using a medium that isn't widely available, but nowadays we watch advertisements for [Samsung TVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq3DWuT6wig) while watching TV on our Samsung. Clearly somewhere along the way, it changed. But I can't figure out where!

I think the question is a little too meta for Google to understand, because I can't seem to find ""early television ads for televisions"" without stumbling on that Bulova ad over and over again. If somebody knows where I can start, how exactly to phrase this search to Google, or even knows of the earliest television ads that advertised televisions, I would be super grateful.

history,17s6rpu,Reframing the Thanksgiving Narrative,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/17s6rpu/reframing_the_thanksgiving_narrative/,36,"For a class project this semester, four of us (a group of MSW Students) read *An Indigenous Peoples’ History of The United States* by Roxane Dunbar Ortiz. We presented to our class on the various myths and misconceptions pervasive in the teaching of indigenous history and culture throughout our own upbringing in the U.S. public education system. Additionally, we analyzed the connection between white settler colonialism and the systems of oppression that are woven through the fabric of our country. To process and cope with the horrific genocide (through military operation, forced assimilation, and internment) designed and executed first by European Colonists and then by the United States Government, we would like to provide a handful of resources relating to history and native resistance, resilience, and healing.

The framework for our presentation was centered around an article written by Evelyn Nakano Glenn: Settler Colonialism as Structure: A Framework for Comparative Studies of U.S. Race and Gender Formation ([https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/attach/journals/jan15srefeature.pdf](https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/attach/journals/jan15srefeature.pdf)). Glenn described white settler colonialism is an ongoing structure rather than a past historical event: The state sanctioned genocide of Native Americans and appropriation of land and resources created a labor vacuum, leading to the creation and flourishing of a chattel slavery market, and the subsequent further exploitation of Mexican, Japanese, and Chinese populations within the United States post abolition. The implications of the formation of these racial dynamics have been far reaching within society, including but certainly not limited to the creation of the Jim Crow South, immigration restrictions, international interventionist policies, and culturally ingrained systematic discrimination. The white settlers “needed to develop conceptions of indigenous people as lesser beings, unworthy of consideration. They harnessed race and gender to construct a hierarchy of humankind.” Glenn doesn’t advocate for the construction of a hierarchy of human suffering: “racisms targeting different groups are not identical and different racisms cannot be made equivalent by drawing analogies between different forms of subordination.” She does however advocate for the necessity of a broader, holistic understanding of racism in the United States and the interconnected nature of oppressions.

While the progressive movements of the 20th century (the labor movement, the civil rights movement, 2nd wave feminism, etc.) have been a big part of our historical upbringing, the indigenous experience has largely been whitewashed and glossed over, despite the extreme perversion of indigenous symbolism, language, and culture in our society. We would encourage you to read Ortiz’s novel and Glenn's article, as they will challenge many of the faulty assumptions and half-understandings that are inherent in our education system’s curriculum. It is our hope that in providing these resources, you may enter the thanksgiving season with a mindfulness of the suffering that has occurred and the resilience of nations that still have to fight to be heard in the modern political setting.

history,17lvnai,What was Japanese leadership’s view of the likelihood of a steady atomic supply by the Allies?,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/17lvnai/what_was_japanese_leaderships_view_of_the/,47,"Whenever I am doing reading on this topic, I come across supposed statements from Japanese leaders like this one or Anami supposedly stated following Hiroshima: 

> “I am convinced that the Americans had only one bomb, after all.”

When trying to trace the source, the furthest back I could find any reference to such a statement came from [1995](https://web.archive.org/web/20090421011049/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983264-5,00.html) without citation. I also found a vague reference in Asada’s 1998 [Reconsideration](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3641184):

> “Although the proceedings of the council do not exist, it appears the Army Minister Anami indulged in wishful thinking when he said that the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was the only atomic bomb the United States possessed.”

Similar such statements exist for other leaders like Admiral Soemu Toyoda who according to Wikipedia:

> “estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging ‘*there would be more destruction but the war would go on*’.

Their [source](https://archive.org/details/japanswargreatpa0000hoyt/page/n9/mode/1up?q=401) for that does not contain such a quotation, but stated: 

> “They reasoned that the Americans could not have more than one or two more of them. (They were quite right.) So one or two more atomic bombs would be dropped, and there would be more destruction, but the war would go on.”

I mention these two examples mainly to highlight my struggle to find indication that the Japanese didn’t think more atomic bombs could be meaningfully produced. 

My question with that in mind is:

What did Japan’s leadership think in regards to the possibility of continued atomic bombings and what evidence is there of this. If such a view existed, is there any evidence Nagasaki changed it? By most accounts, Nagasaki did not, but I’m mainly interested in the first aspect.

She was launched in October 1938 and sunk by the German submarine U-4 on 10 April 1940 near Skudenes, Norway. The wreckage was initially discovered in the Spring of 2024, but wasn't properly identified until earlier this week (October 2023).

HMS Thistle spent the remainder of 1938 and most of 1939 completing sea trials. Her first war patrol, according to records, was conducted almost a year later on 28 September 1939. By 7 April, 1940, HMS Thistle had completed 7 war patrols with little to no action, and was setting out on her 8th patrol.

Under the command of Lt. Wilfrid Frederick Haselfoot, she was ordered to patrol off Stavanger, Norway, and to sink any enemy vessel that she might spot in the harbour, since British authorities believed that a German invasion of Norway was imminent. While on patrol, HMS Thistle spotted the German submarine U-4 cruising on the surface with a periscope. At 16:04 hours on 9 April 1940, HMS Thistle fired a spread of six torpedoes, all of which missed U-4. Her crew later reported the unsuccessful engagement via radio, and that the submarine had only two torpedoes left. It is unclear what happened after this engagement, but at some point the HMS Thistle surfaced to charge her batteries. It was during this time that the U-4 found HMS Thistle on the surface and reengage. At 02:13 hours on the morning of 10 April 1940, U-4 fired a spread of two torpedoes at its attacker. The first, a G7a torpedo, missed. The second, a magnetic G7e torpedo, struck the submarine and sunk it. It is beleived no one survived and all 53 crew members were lost.

I have been working to build a new Museum of Atheism, which I intend to become a centre of study, public education, discussion, and understanding on belief and unbelief. This museum will have a digital focus, with a collection of objects from across the globe backed up by cutting edge research performed by world-leading experts on atheism and accessible for free on the web. The bricks-and-mortar museum will be in the Greater Manchester area in the UK with exhibitions run worldwide in coordination with local interest groups.

I am currently doing a public consultation on three things:

1. The effectiveness of existing museums at covering atheism.
2. The level of public interest in a new museum of atheism.
3. The form that a potential museum of atheism should take.

The surveys are here: [https://museumofatheism.com/](https://museumofatheism.com/)

Each of the surveys should take less than 3 minutes. The surveys gather no personal information or special categories of data and I am hosting the surveys on my website which allows users to reject cookies.

I'd really appreciate your input. There's no specific participation criteria: I'm interested in everyone's views.

About me: I'm Dr James C Ford, a researcher, historian, museums professional, director of Stoa Strategy, and most recently author of [*Atheism at the Agora: A History of Unbelief in Ancient Greek Polytheism*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003393085/atheism-agora-james-ford) with Routledge.

history,16xm9ma,Holocaust Memorial Day Trust | Disabled people,53,https://www.hmd.org.uk/learn-about-the-holocaust-and-genocides/nazi-persecution/disabled-people/,10,"""In 1933 the ‘Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring’ was passed, allowing for the forced sterilisation of those regarded as ‘unfit’. This included people with conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and alcoholism. Prisons, nursing homes, asylums, care homes for the elderly and special schools were targeted to select people for sterilisation. It has been estimated that between 1933 and 1939, 360,000 individuals were subjected to forced sterilisation.

In 1939 the killing of disabled children and adults began. All children under the age of three who had illnesses or a disability, such as Down’s syndrome, or cerebral palsy were targeted under the T4 programme. A panel of medical experts were required to give their approval for the ‘euthanasia’, or supposed ‘mercy-killing’, of each child.

Many parents were unaware of the fate of their children, instead being told that they were being sent for improved care. After a period of time parents were told their children had died of pneumonia and their bodies cremated to stop the spread of disease.

Following the outbreak of war in September 1939 the programme was expanded. Adults with disabilities, chronic illnesses, mental health problems and criminals who were not of German origin were included in the programme. Six killing centres were established to speed up the process – the previous methods of killing people by lethal injection or starvation were deemed too slow to cope with large numbers of adults. The first experimental gassings took place at the killing centre in Brandenberg and thousands of disabled patients were killed in gas chambers disguised as shower rooms.

The model used for killing disabled people was later applied to the industrialised murder within Nazi concentration and death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.

It is estimated that close to 250,000 disabled people were murdered under the Nazi regime.""",2023-10-02 03:44:11

The NYC Tenement Museum presents a great article on this time period and the media's response: ([https://www.tenement.org/blog/after-the-riots-new-yorks-black-community-responds-and-rebuilds/](https://www.tenement.org/blog/after-the-riots-new-yorks-black-community-responds-and-rebuilds/))

Martin Delany, an early Pan Africanist, was a regular contributor to the paper and spoke on Pan African ideals - this overlap alone speaks to the consciousness being fostered in NYC, and abroad of course. He had to been aware of the riots. But even more evidently, the paper tacitly called for black emigration. Here is a scholarly source that touches upon this intersection:([https://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+fair+and+open+field%3A+the+responses+of+black+New+Yorkers+to+the...-a0339255270](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+fair+and+open+field%3A+the+responses+of+black+New+Yorkers+to+the...-a0339255270))

Most importantly, the Riots showed that racism was alive in the North - blacks weren’t safe anywhere in the country. While the Riots were against the Civil War draft, it quickly devolved to targeting blacks, blaming them for the war itself. As blacks fled from NYC, they emigrated to Brooklyn (then a separate city) and this became a microcosm of an exodus that was called for at the national level - especially black businesses that were targeted during the riots. This scholarly source describes the historic Brooklyn community of Weeksville and their resistance to emigration prior to the War and the Riots. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/90018208?read-now=1#page\_scan\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/90018208?read-now=1#page_scan_tab_contents))

In conclusion, my main argument is that we cannot discuss Pan Africanism and its development without discussing the Draft Riots and to a smaller extent, the global impact that NYC has had since arguably the late 18th century.",2023-09-15 15:27:45

However according to this [research paper](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-23062-7_1), it makes reference to a Chinese writer Guan Zhong, who made references to lodestone, that lived before 645 BCE, meaning about almost 100 years before Thales of Miletus, or perhaps less than that.

And apparently, a quote by Guan Zhong states that *""Where there is cinnabar above, yellow gold will be found below. Where there is lodestone above, copper and gold will be found below. Where there is calamine above, lead, tin, and red copper will be found below. Where there is haematite above, iron will be found below. Thus it can be seen that mountains are full of riches.""*

However it doesn't mention in the quote the magnetic properties of lodestone, it just mentions that the sign of lodestone means the presence of minerals like copper and gold. I mean lodestone or magnetite has been known in the ancient times probably dating as far as the 2nd millenium or 3rd millenium BCE.

There is a legend that a shepherd named Magnes 4000 years ago accidently discovered lodestone, however this is more of a myth then a historical fact. 

Ancient Indians knew about lodestones since the Vedic period, in the Atharva Veda, maybe it was the Indians who were the first to make references to Lodestone.,

To provide transportation from the City of Dallas to the City of Oak Cliff, Marsalis developed the first reliable transit service across the Trinity River. The right-of-way of that transit line was Jefferson Boulevard along which the steam train ran; then the electric streetcars and the interurban which ran to Fort Worth, and finally automobiles and buses.

The City of Oak Cliff was annexed into Dallas in 1903. In the succeeding years from 1910 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard, originally platted for residential development, became the commercial, financial and social heart of Oak Cliff. Businessmen saw West Jefferson as an opportunity to locate along this busy transit line, providing professional services, retail goods, and other services to the surrounding neighborhoods which were developing during this time: Winnetka Heights, Miller Stemmons, King’s Highway, Ruthmede, Kessler Park, Lake Cliff and Trinity Heights. West Jefferson Boulevard developed as the Central Business District or Downtown for Oak Cliff. It was easily accessible to all the surrounding neighborhoods listed above because of the streetcar lines which ran down West Jefferson and turned north on Tyler branching east and west; south on Tyler into Ruthmede; south on Zang and continuing along West Jefferson to the Boundary district and linking to the interurban to Fort Worth. 

**Dallas, during this time, became a bi-nodal city; a city with two central areas, one represented by Downtown Dallas and one represented by West Jefferson. Another period of growth along West Jefferson occurred during the years after World War II and continued into the early 1950s further confirming its position as the downtown for Oak Cliff. Several large retailers built new buildings along West Jefferson, Sears, JCPenney, and the first suburban Kress in Dallas, and other property owners refaced their 1920s buildings to accommodate the tastes of the prosperous post war consumer. This idea of a bi-nodal city, or at least the importance of West Jefferson as a substantial commercial center, was often acknowledged in the Dallas newspapers, articles in 1933, 1948, and 1965, describe this area as second only to Downtown Dallas in size and sales tax generation. West Jefferson stretches for 10 continuous blocks or 1 mile (1.6 km) in length.**

**It is believed that no other city in Texas had this type of development of a [“city within a city”](https://flashbackdallas.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/oak-cliff-city-within-a-city_cover_ca-1929_smu.jpg) and two downtown commercial districts. West Jefferson continues to be the downtown of Oak Cliff expressing the cohesive yet culturally diverse community which it serves.**

Jefferson Boulevard was originally platted as the right-of-way for the major thoroughfare through Oak Cliff, first for the steam line, then the streetcar and interurban, and finally the automobile. West Jefferson, although platted for residential development, became the center for commercial activity in Oak Cliff. The surrounding streets of Sunset, Center, and Twelfth developed as suburban residential streets for the working and middle class. The architectural styles in the West Jefferson Historic District reflect the urban commercial forms prevalent from 1910 to 1950. The majority of the commercial growth in this area occurred between 1920 and 1940. Because this was not a planned shopping center such as Highland Park Village - the first self-contained shopping center in America, the individual property owners constructed their commercial buildings as they would their homes, in styles they personally liked. This resulted in the construction of a variety of commercial styles. Many of these smaller scale commercial buildings are stylistically unique. West Jefferson contains a variety of urban commercial styles of which there is no other comparable collection in Dallas. The most prominent building along West Jefferson is the 1920s Art Deco style Jefferson Tower. It was the first high-rise constructed in Oak Cliff. Although many of the buildings have been altered, as noted above, several of these alterations occurred in the post War years. These alterations and the other later alterations that have occurred are mainly to the first floor retail area, exchanging weed fronts for aluminum and covering over transom windows. Architectural analysis indicates that these buildings can be restored with minimal work and guidance. 

West Jefferson Boulevard commercial development originally occurred at two nodes: between Beckley and Zang and between Polk and Tyler. The architecture in these areas reflect early urban commercial styles from 1910 to 1925. 

More common along West Jefferson is the one story commercial building which houses several retail spaces. One particular style of this genre is a tan brick one story with a mansard type roof and a pedimented entry and, usually, a corner entry with an arch and fan light. Transom windows are above the large single pane display windows. This style can be seen in four retail segments along West Jefferson. 

In the period from 1925 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard saw a great deal of commercial growth. Despite the Depression, this is the period during which most of the growth occurred on West Jefferson. Such buildings as the Texas Theatre and several other commercial buildings were constructed between 1925 and 1935. The Texas Theatre, now an historic landmark, was the largest suburban theater in Dallas. This Spanish Eclectic t​​heater was part of a chain of theaters once owned by Howard Hughes. In November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended here after the Kennedy Assassination. It was one of multiple theaters along West Jefferson with the Rosewin Theatre (named after the adjacent neighborhoods of Rosemont and Winnetka Heights) between Polk and Tyler being demolished in 1976, later replaced with a modern one story commercial building.

Even though Oak Cliff declined as a result of white flight and the exodus to the suburbs (a common pattern across America at the time), it’s interesting that Dallas maintained two vibrant downtown districts at one point until after [the late 60s-early 70s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/wo9jj1/oak_cliffs_main_street_jefferson_blvd_1971_silent/).

It's long, but the subject is fascinating, I think. It is part of a bigger text I wrote about the Medieval Western Mediterranean.  
  
\------  
  
The tombstone was set in late 12th century Norman Sicily. It’s of a woman, the mother of a noble priest.

[The Tombstone for Anna - Symbol of a Medieval Melting Pot/](https://squarekufic.com/2018/03/30/the-tombstone-for-anna-the-symbol-of-a-medieval-melting-pot/)

Additional info from the Museum With No Frontiers:

[Inscription in Four Languages](https://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;it;Mus01_C;34;en)

A few things are unusual about the tombstone. The most striking thing is that it contains writings in four distinct writing systems, and three languages. Latin to the left, Greek to the right, Arabic below, and Judeo-Arabic, or Arabic written in Hebrew characters, on top. (Around the time when this tombstone was created, 90% of the world’s Jews spoke a form of Judeo-Arabic as their first language. Nearly all major Jewish works of literature of the Middle Ages were written in some form of Arabic. Within a decade of the creation of the tombstone, the greatest of all Arabic Jewish philosopher-theologians, the great Maimonides, would start writing his first work.) That in itself makes it incredibly unique.  
  
A little background. The gravestone was created in Norman Sicily. The Normans are an interesting bunch. These were descendants of Vikings, whose ancestors had settled in Western France in the 10th century. In the 11th century, these French Vikings managed to conquer a whole bunch of territory, including England (where Norman rule led to the development of a distinct English language) and Moorish Sicily. It’s Sicily under these Normans that gave us the tombstone.  
  
[Arriving in Sicily in the 1061](http://normansicily.org/en/resources/learn/group_one/), a time in which the Zirid emirate of Greater Tunisia, on which Sicily was semi-dependent, laid devastated as a result of massive Bedouin migrations, turning the extremely prosperous, highly centralized central North Africa into a land of lawless nomads, with Bedouin tribes leveling cities, vandalizing farming land and disrupting trade routes. With Sicily itself embroiled in an 8-year long civil war, the great Roger I of Sicily led the Normans into conquest.  
  
Central North Africa, as opposed to the less urbanized Morocco and the Libyan deserts, would always hold onto a pretty sophisticated urban tradition, in towns such as Tunis, Bejaija, Constantine, Sousse and Mahdia, but with the Bedouinization of the interior, Tunisia’s urban culture was for centuries restricted to a thin stretch of coast. Up until the 19th century, Tunisia’s internal political culture was defined by a clash between the towns and the nomads, high civilization and anarchy existing side by side. With central North Africa in chaos, Sicily became especially vulnerable to an outside attack.  
  
With the arrival of the Normans in Sicily, something interesting happened. Roger I turned out to be an arabophile. After having secured the island, the Normans went on to embrace the Arabic customs they encountered. From using Arabic political titles ('amiratus amiratorum'), to giving birth to an architectural style that was infused with Arabic elements, to appointing Muslims to senior political positions (Ibn Zafar al-Siqilli, Abu'l-Qasim ibn Hammud ibn al-Hajar), to attracting Arabic intellectuals from across the sea (Muhammad al-Idrisi, Abu al-Salt), even to using the Arabic language in a semi-official capacity. For nearly two centuries, Christian Sicily was governed as a Muslim emirate.  
  
Decades after this tombstone was set, a funerary memorial contained the following sentence, describing Sicily’s capital city, Palermo, the largest city in Europe at that point:  
  
'urbs felix, populo dotata trilingua'  
  
Meaning: 'fortunate city, endowed with a trilingual people'. Stepping back, it shouldn’t be surprising to see these languages being used.  
  
Back to the tombstone. The different texts apparently differ significantly from each other. The Arabic text, for example, refers to the Pope as the ‘imam of Rome’. It refers to the church where the lady was initially buried as a ‘jami’, a word meaning assembly, but more commonly used to refer to a main mosque.  
  
The inscriptions refer to the death of Anna, mother of Grisanto, a priest of the Norman sovereign Ruggero (Roger), who died in 1148 and was buried in the great jami (subsequently Palermo Cathedral) and from there taken by her son to the Church of San Michele Arcangelo and the chapel known as Sant’Anna, built by Grisanto in 1149.  
  
Other tombstones consisting of Latin, Greek and Arabic writings have been found, but this is the only one that also includes a Hebrew inscription.  
  
These types of inscriptions had an obvious proselytizing goal. In other words, these types of inscriptions were made to help spread the word of Christ to Muslims and Jews (and Orthodox Greeks), not an attempt to declare Islam and Judaism as equals of Christianity. Others have suggested that the Arabic texts were directed at Muslim and Jewish converts to Christianity, and to Arabic-speaking native Sicilian Christians.

We’re Washington Post reporters Nicole Dungca, Claire Healy and Andrew Ba Tran. We published a deep dive into Aleš Hrdlička, the founder and head curator of physical anthropology for the Smithsonian – and the man behind at least 19,000 of its collection of human remains.

Hrdlička was long held in esteem by the organization, and was known as an authority on physical anthropology and the origins of mankind during his lifetime. But many are now revisiting his well-documented racist beliefs and ties to eugenics.

Over a year and a half of reporting this story, we explored Hrdlička’s notoriety and how he used his status to influence U.S. government policies on race, built a network of body part procurers and distributed instructions on his methods for harvesting remains from hospitals and other places all over the world.

We examined thousands of documents and interviewed dozens of Smithsonian officials, experts, descendants and members of affected communities to piece together one of the most extensive looks at his work and collections to date. Ask us anything.

For example, on [*Histories, 4.81*](https://sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/h04080.htm), the historian Tacitus talks about Vespasian doing miracles and curing the blind. I'm nothing asking about the obvious parallel story latter found in the [*Christian Gospel*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208%3A22-25&version=NIV). 

Vespasian itself seemed to repulse the common people, and the miracles supposedly happened just because Gods chosen the emperor to bring luck. 

Did Roman emperors claimed to be saving the weak and beating evil forces is any somewhat way the *Good vs Evil* tales we have? Even if under specific cases. 

It's known Romans sacrificed the life of gladiators to appeased dead spirits, but it sounds a small issue if compared with a spiritual warfare. 

Did they had any trouble-maker spirit powerful enough to bring chaos such like Devil, that Caesar was the hero against it? Perhaps when depicting gods of war rivals.

history,15r53gc,Question on Civilization,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/15r53gc/question_on_civilization/,107,"Hey y’all, I had a quick question. If modern human beings were believed to originate from Africa, particularly eastern* Africa why is it that we see the first civilization in the Middle East (Mesopotamia). Why didn’t civilization start around the area that modern human beings developed? 

Ethiopia has a great deal of natural resources and water from the Nile and Red Sea. Also the only other group of humans were several thousand miles away in Asia (Neanderthals/ Denisovans).  Also didn’t modern humans spend several thousand years in Africa before leaving? I just thought it would make sense to assume that civilization would have started around Ethiopia and then gradually moved outwards to the rest of the world. 

Especially considering that Early Africa was very tropical and teaming with life. The Sahara wasn’t a desert and there were massive sources of fresh watr like Mega Lake Chad. I assumed that the same evolutionary pressures that resulted in the formation of modern humans should have technically resulted in the formation of civilization right? Like a bunch of smart humans in proximity to one another + fresh water + minimal competition + ample food = first civilization? 
 
Like even if modern human beings made it out of Africa before civilization was a thing wouldn’t civilization eventually start where people started farming first and stopped being nomadic? Wouldn’t that location be Africa, again because of the vast amounts of farming land, vast rivers  bodies in the east, north, and west. The increased amount of game etc etc. just weird that virtually nothing happens around east Africa until civilization started on the Mediterranean? 

If civilization started in multiple locations wouldn’t the most prominent civilizations be in Africa again because Africa has like virtually all the world’s resources (40%gold, 90% platinum, Precious stones, various plant and animal life etc etc). How much did the desertification of the sahara have on early life in Africa? Are there any ruins from near the Sahara?

(I'll be mostly literal in the replies as is the German way. If any aggressive vibes come about, it's not intended whatsoever) 


For one, the quality of his victories speak volumes. 

First let us consider Issus,

If we ignore the convenient dying of Memnon rendering the Persian fleet kinda useless at just the perfect time and consider the battle of Issus as an example. Then we can see that the ""brilliance"" of Alexander is obviously romanticized and blown out of proportion. First, once the common Myth of Dariuses Foolishness is overcome by interjecting that Darius was of the correct Persuasion that the Macedonian Army was split, his moves towards issus make sense. As he most likely intended to defeat by detail. However, it was only because of a convenient Storm that his position was made known to Alexander, thus ruining the plan. (source:Murison, C. L. “Darius III and the Battle of Issus.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 21, no. 3, 1972, pp. 399–423. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4435274. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023.) And forcing Darius to retreat into Issus, and fight on unfavorable terrain, since by chance, they were a few hours late, and Macedon had united as a force. Thus that was the only option. Luck was on Alexanders side. It would take a good general to capitalize on the luck of course, however this advantage saved his neck. Thus, he cannot be called the greatest or unbelievably talented.As he did not produce an ingenius solution, but merely speeded to Parmenion. He exploited his luck in the most unoriginal matter.
Not to forget of course that many of the accounts are heavily propagandized (Nicholas G. L. Hammond. “Alexander’s Charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 B.C.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 41, no. 4, 1992, pp. 395–406. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4436258. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023)

  
And of course here much can be criticized on Darius as well, such as Darius not making use of his advantages he had at hand at Issus. Seeing that the macedonian center was advancing, and that he was the chased price so to speak and would have been pursued, and that Parmenion was kept busy by his cavalry, the obvious move here would have been to retreat while barraging the macedons with archers. Tiring them out. And so, essentially split up the macedon army. Seeing that the macedon center has still not engaged with the enemy, not even Alexander would have been suicidal enough to charge with his cavalry alone. As response, Alexander would concentrate on the Persian cavalry, and here would have been the best time to close in, and surround the macedon army. Winning the day. But Darius not doing this does not diminish Alexanders capabilities as a general.

  
Next Gaugamela.

  
As Beloch himself argues in the ""Griechische Geschichte"", during Gaugamela Alexander left his position as commander in chief, to pursue the made opening in the persian army. This is of course in line with the reality of Alexander being reckless and young. A greatest of all time type, unbelievably talente general would not pursue a local victory, since it is known that that leads to disaster without calculating the risks of it first. But Alexander due to being young and impulsive would of course recklessly charge at the local opening in the persian center. The idea that this was somehow Voluntary and according to a strategic machination by Alexander is hard to believe. For one, it seems more that this was an impulsive decision. Especially considering that Parmenions messengers did not reach Alexander. (Source: Devine, A. M. “Grand Tactics at Gaugamela.” Phoenix, vol. 29, no. 4, 1975, pp. 374–85. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/1087282. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023.)
Meaning, this was not part of the plan. Or else, the messengers would have known to seek him elsewhere. Meaning, this was great risky adapting to the present circumstance, rather than pre meditated strategems.
 This debacle being enabled of course, by darius once more not using his advantages correctly. Had he burned the two routes at the start, and forced Alexander to enter deeper into Persia, starving him out, he would have won.

  
Making use of the enemies blunders and luck is what a good general does, and doing that whilst adapting to current battlefield changes is also nothing short of good, but to be in the greatest of all time, that is nowhere near enough. 

  
Contrast this with the Battles of Hannibal. Where the Fabian strategy was the only plausible way the romans could have won against Hannibal. The blunders that were made by the Romans, such as not expecting Hannibal to cross the alps, or expecting to win at Cannae, were not as critical as these by Darius. Hannibal passing the Alps for example is something that no one could or should have expected since it is a suicidal idea, it was not merely difficult, it was crazy. Morover, the suicidality is even increased when you have a potentially disloyal army of mercenaries.  And at Cannae, the Romans correctly guessed that the Carthaginian center was the weakest point. So that Hannibal himself came to the center for Moral boost. Hannibal making it that far shows that he produced victories that in Quality, not result alone, but in quality and ingenuity, far outmatch anything Alexander ever did. Furthermore, it is premediated strategy and cunning that is at play most of the time with Hannibal. Not live battlefield adaptation as with Alexander. The plans hannibal developed working most of the time, prove an inherent grasp at how the battlefield will develop, thus not needing to even adapt. 
Further more, Hannibal has a better grasp at psychology than Alexander. As can be seen by his treatment of of the non latin italic prisoners, his use of Roman pride in baiting and more. Psychological warfare is as important to a general as literal warfare. 

  
Now, it can be argued, but he achieved all his goals! Surely that justifies being called THE greatest and unbelievably talented. However, that is simplistic. Consider his grand strategic conditions:  mediocre king for a Persian Emperor ruling a declining empire as a rival, a great army left to you by your father, and Egyptians which hate Persia more than they hate you. And of course ancient supply possibilities which rendered the manpower pool of 1 million the persians had effectively useless. Grand Strategically speaking, all the stars align for your victory. Under those conditions you cannot lose as long as you are decent and good which Alexander was. Thus, this accomplishment is blown out of proportion. 
  
Contrast this with Hannibals Situation. Hannibal faced the Romans. They would send legion after legion due to sheer relentlessness and will power alone, risking to essentially suicide their own nation just to defeat Hannibal which was unheard of at that time. Alexander, had no such relentless and irrational enemies to fight. Even if Persia was big and vast, it was no Rome, it did not posses Romes grit and determination. At home, the senate of Carthage wont supply you with ships or armies or anything you need. So You are on your own. And in the meantime you win, Spain is being conquered by romans and there is nothing you can do cause you are not omnipresent. And the longer you fight, the longer your tactics might be learned by the enemy. Since not even Hannibal could be ingenius forever.  Being 20 Years undefeated in the Roman Backyard under those conditions so to speak, solidifies the greatness Hannibal had. His defeat of course is unsurprising. It was impossible for him to win from a grand strategic standpoint.But making it that far, shows the Brilliance needed to actually be at least candidate to be called the greatest of all time and unbelievably talented.  To actually be the greatest of all time, more is needed of course. So not even Hannibal would be the greatest. 

  
Now, here it can be argued, but Hannibal whom you say is so great, admired Alexander! Thus, Alexander has to be deserving of higher esteem. Not really. Now, although it is murky and the origins cannot be reliably determined, it is reported that hannibal said, that were it not for his final defeat, that he himself would have been the greatest general and because he lost it remains to be Alexander. We can see that Hannibal thought in terms of results alone and not quality of results. It does not matter if Alexander as a general was not as good as himself, Alexander still never was officially defeated and could claim to have conquered the known world. Thus, Hannibal thought he too would need to at least hold the tittle of  never being defeated and his obvious superior qualities as a general would guarannty his place at the top. Thus, Alexander really does not deserve higher esteem because of Hannibals supposed admiration. 

  
The reason he, Alexander, was admired, is a rather superficial one. He never lost(but of course is not alone in having done this so it is also not that special), but could also claim to have conquered the known world. This combination, is the winning combination for good propaganda. Being the only man who conquered the world at only 30 years of age is mesmerizing enough to ignore your shortcomings.  And of course as a King Personality, he does not come close to Cyrus. As he was detested by his asian subjects, and his arrogance was known to all corners of the world. Thus, Alexander is to be placed lower on the ladder than the likes of Hannibal for General, and the likes of Cyrus for King and Leader. He is talented, but among many talented greats.",2023-08-10 06:41:51
history,15lgb9c,The Confusion of More Than One Germanus in Early Post-Roman Britain,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/15lgb9c/the_confusion_of_more_than_one_germanus_in_early/,4,"Famously, Germanus of Auxerre was sent to Britain by Pope Celestine I in 429 to fight against the spread of Pelagianism, and then he was sent again in 447.  
  
Many later medieval texts, which speak about the fifth and sixth centuries, refer to a prominent religious figure named Germanus. For example, he appears in [the account in the Historia Brittonum](http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/n03.html) of Vortigern’s death. He is mentioned as the figure who ordained Dubricius. The seventh or eighth century Life of St Samson says that Germanus was the instructor of Illtud. And many other examples could be given.  
  
But the problem is that many of these references are completely chronologically incompatible with Germanus of Auxerre, since he died in 448. For example, Dubricius is generally held to have been born in about 465, long after that Germanus had died. The Life of St Samson shows that Illtud’s lifetime overlapped considerably with that of Samson, yet Samson is shown to have outlived Conomor, who died in 560. So Illtud could not have been instructed by Germanus of Auxerre.  
  
My theory (and this is something which [quite a few scholars have suggested before](https://www.library.wales/fileadmin/docs_gwefan/new_structure/discover/digital_exhibitions/printed_material/welsh_classical_dictionary/06_G.pdf), including the well-respected David Dumville) is that there was a second Germanus, one who lived in the latter part of the fifth century.  
  
Interestingly, [there is a record](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18482/18482-h/18482-h.htm#chap6092) of Patrick having a disciple named Germanus, whom he set up as bishop of the Isle of Man. Since Patrick was active in the second half of the fifth century, this Germanus would be perfectly placed chronologically to be the Germanus of most of the medieval British texts.  
  
However, I believe that at least one of these references is best explained by a *third* Germanus. The eighth century Life of St Brioc [specifically notes](https://www.library.wales/fileadmin/docs_gwefan/new_structure/discover/digital_exhibitions/printed_material/welsh_classical_dictionary/02_A-B.pdf) that Illtud was sent to be taught by Germanus *in Paris*. Interestingly, we know that there was a [bishop of Paris called Germanus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Germanus-of-Paris) in the mid sixth century. Therefore, this would logically be the Germanus who instructed Illtud, and this would allow Illtud’s life to comfortably overlap that of Samson, who lived to see Conomor’s death in 560.",2023-08-08 12:06:08

""The authors of the study therefore proposed a new hybrid hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages, with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a subsequent branch northwards onto the Steppe, as a secondary homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe with the later Yamnaya and Corded Ware-associated expansions.

This seems to make sense and builds on most of the consensus we have had. Language and genetic origins always seem mobile and slowly changing. People move.

For context I work in a charity shop and we get some weird stuff, but I found a bible that was realllllyyy old like, looked to be victorian, it even had italic handwriting with a name that was E.Tibble and the Town of Fordham (Which is nearish to where I work). 

Unfortunately, I don't have this bible, work wouldn't let me keep it cause they want to sell it on ebay so they can make more money on the item :/, there wasn't even date on the damn thing only where it was printed which was at Oxford University or Oxford University Press. 

There was however some very old photos inside the bible, presumably of it's owner or someone who knew the person in the photos. The weird part is the photos appeared to have been taken in America as there's a flag seems to look like the american one and america is mentioned on the text. 

I can't attach the images but I have links to the discord chat where I sent photos of them.

the one on the bottom has clearer text but I can retake photos upon request.

I'd just want to know more about these images, if they're actually Victorian, when exactly they were taken etc also just to show you guys.

P.S I showed these to my friend who's into History and from Canada so their familiar with the american flag and confirmed the flag had 13 stripes making it american.

It's been a few weeks since the black out, and a few weeks of being in restricted mode. But at midnight tonight, r/history will be re-entering full operations. 

The Good.

The protest and subsequent actions did bring some benefits, Reddit have put more things in place to increase moderation on the official Reddit app. This is a good thing as it should hopefully make our jobs a little easier in the future. 

Toolbox, our major moderating app survived! Kinda. Although it lost one of the developers (and our ex-mod) the app is still functional. Even though there was a hiccup with the app, Reddit were quickly on the case and fixed it.

We have new mods! Whether they are brave or fools is yet to be decided, but we managed to bring a few more people on the mod team. You might see them around, you might not. But they will always be watching, so use that report button!

The protest brought into the light Reddit's failings. With the failure of taking into account moderators and users who are blind and showing moderators exactly what the management thinks about them. Removing whole mod teams and various other issues. Combine that with the recent debacle on Reddit coins.... Yeah the future is uncertain. 

The Bad

Reddit threw a wedge between the users and the mods, which is only going to make our job harder. We know we are a volunteer force, and they've made our volunteer job much harder by making users more antagonistic towards the mods as well. 

Third party apps are dead dead dead. Alas the API changes were never reversed, and Reddit is a worse off place for it. 

But that's enough about that. It's been a long month, and we hope you are looking forward to having more history content back on your feeds in future!",2023-07-16 19:33:54

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read.

My name is Dr. Gary Girod. My dissertation was on the topic of the British and French governments developing mass domestic surveillance during World War I. My research discovered that most of this mass surveillance was directed against foreign spies (namely German) who the governments believed were everywhere and ready to sabotage the country! Turns out, they weren't; spymania was wildly overblown. However, by 1917 British and French workers, led by socialists/communists led mass strikes. This gave government surveillance organizations a whole new raison d'être: spying on 'subversive' citizens to prevent a communist revolution. I argue that these orgs and practices led to the creation of the modern surveillance state in Britain and France, with impacts beyond. My research went far beyond just WWI; in fact I even researched all the way back to 1066, so if you have any questions regarding the development of the government snooping on its people I might have the answer!

While this AMA is focused on my diss I do have other specialties. You might know me as the host of [The French History Podcast](https://www.thefrenchhistorypodcast.com/). I host the main series which covers the history of France from 3 million years ago to the present in a chronological series like Mike Duncan's The History of Rome, only from the time France was a frozen tundra all the way to present day.

So, if you have any questions about mass surveillance in WWI Britain and France, or general questions on surveillance or French history I will do my best to answer. Let's go!",2023-06-25 12:59:58
