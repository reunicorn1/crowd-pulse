We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

personalfinance,1gq3woi,Homeless screw-up future looks bleak,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gq3woi/homeless_screwup_future_looks_bleak/,44,"I have been homeless since June. I sleep in a minivan (by no means a van-life YouTube creator built out fairytale). I've survived the brutal heat of summer with no air conditioner somehow. Winter approaching, with months of job rejections and short term gigs coming and going all being spent on car insurance and my phone bill. Now I am unemployed and utterly hopeless. 

Being kicked out of surveys, grinding for hours to earn maybe 3 dollars on these survey apps, I wonder how I got into this situation. 

I was not raised normal by any means. I have mental disorders which make me employment-challenged, not to mention my lack of any trade skills or any education. im just floating in this world at this point. I once had a permanent job a year ago but short lived and haven't found a full time permanent one since. 

if a job even hires me at this point, once I start earning those small 17 an hour paychecks, what would be an effective way to use small amounts of money? I am in 6k debt with a 490 credit score, in debt collection for many different things, rent in my city is 2500 for an apartment, I have nobody out here to save me and even my local Amazon is not hiring. I have 10 dollars now and piling overdue bills, plus no telling how I'll pay for gas. I need advice how someone with nothing but a laptop can earn some serious money during a big employment gap. 

I wonder what a healthier person would do, someone who has it all together, if they were in my spot right now, what kind of advice they could give me to help me escape the hole I dug myself into.

He missed the dollar cost averaging in May and September. I told him he missed these months, he was unaware and apologized. Now it appears to me, he missed it **again** in October. In October, he realized some gains as follows: Sell 120k in stocks, transfer 100k to another account and re-invest 20k. He did not deploy new funds. I feel him telling me, ""No I didn't miss it"", ""See I invested 20k on October 18"", the same day he sold, is like a cover. What do you think?

personalfinance,1gq7fy1,Roth contributions and conversions…need help!,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gq7fy1/roth_contributions_and_conversionsneed_help/,4,"Hi all, I run a one man S-Corp consultancy, generating approximately $350k/yr. Im single head of household (if that matters). I’m finally in a position to effectively contribute and boost my retirement savings, but feel confused by the various nuances, so looking for some guidance.

I believe a solo 401(k) is the right product to setup vs a SEP and it seems I can also setup a Roth IRA. 

- Would I also need the solo 401k to have a Roth portion, or just use the Roth IRA?

I want to make all my contribution to end up as Roth for future tax free growth. 

- Does this make sense, or should I max out my pre-tax of $23k and the remaining $46k from the employer side for conversion?

1) I have an existing traditional IRA. Will I need to rollover the balance to the solo 401k before doing any conversions?

2) if I have the solo 401k, can I still contribute to a traditional Ira and convert that to Roth (backdoor conversion)? If so, how do I contribute funds to that plan? (Ie do I cut a check or do I have to guide my payroll provider to funnel after-tax dollars to it?)

3) can I contribute to the traditional Ira from the company, or do those funds need to come from my personal account?

4) how do I fund the $46k in this case? Since this is an employer contribution, do I just cut a check/wire from the business account, and then separately set aside estimated funds for taxes (ie 25% of $46k).

This is all rather confusing (and I’m a finance degree holder!)

For 2024, I’d like to make a max $7k Ira to roth backdoor contribution, and start funding the solo 401k for 2025.

What should I do between now and the new year to set this all in motion?

Thank you all so much for your guidance. I’ve read a lot in this subreddit, read content and watched videos, but still rather confused.",2024-11-13 07:19:30

29 Male living in the midwest

Currently making $50k a year. This could probably be a Dave Ramsey episode but here it goes:

  
Also, I know how bad this is. lol I am not asking whether thats the case or not. I am moreso just looking for advice, plan of attack etc from different perspectives. I cant change the past, so I have to live with it and attack this head on since we are wanting to buy a house at some point in the future. I know right now that it would be damn near impossible how I am currently sitting. 

I am currently $74k in total debt in my life. Thats with everything included. These numbers are approx. Monthly expenses on top, total debt under. 

Rent: $1475

Utilities: $300-$400



2016 F150: Owe $24k @ $540/month with 5 years left on the note

Personal Loan: $15k @ $340/month 

Credit Cards: $13k

Owe my Dad $8000

Owe my Mom $14000

  
Me and my fiance also just had a baby 7 weeks ago so some money is being spent there. My credit cards were at zero due to my parents loaning me the money to pay them off so I was getting killed on interest. Thats why I owe them so much. However, my fiance has not worked since late august because her doctor told her to go on bed rest due to some late pregnancy issues. And since we have had the baby, she is on her 12 week maternity leave. So she is not slated to get a full paycheck until after the holidays. So, I’ve been using my credit card for every day purchases since August, to make sure I have enough money in my checking account to pay rent. But then I also, add to the debt. It’s a terrible cycle. 

  
With me making $2600 or so a month: I am left trying to pay all of our/my monthly bills and its currently killing me. I know that when she goes back to work, it will free up an extra $700 for me that i was paying for rent. But even then, I dont know if thats enough to really do a damn thing. 

  
My main question is, should I sell my truck for something dirt cheap? I am trying to balance a safe vehicle for my son and the cost of it. Because right now, the truck is the only tangible item i own that could help out. Because if I get rid of that $540 a month with the $700 also, that would free up an extra $1240 that I could use to pay down a lot of my debt a lot quicker than I currently am. 

  
Idk, I am just rambling at this point. 

  
I do know that I am beyond tired of my current financial situation and really considering all options to get it back on track.

  
Thanks in advance everyone. ",2024-11-13 04:41:23

I felt it was safe to let him use my credit to finance the van.

Then we broke up. He has continued giving me the money to make the payments but I'm just uneasy. I can't afford the payments on my own if he stops paying. Loan and Title are in my name. He's willing to get the loan on his name but I have no idea how to go about that. Help!

I have plenty saved, but I would like to add to my credit history. I don't have any large monthly payments by living with my parents. However, the thought of having debt is daunting.

My thoughts while looking for a car are putting 10k down and financing the 5k. Because I hate debt, i was thinking of doing a 36 month but paying off the loan by the first year.

My question is, is this the best way to improve my credit history? I have a 780-790 credit score, but just with 2 cards. Thanks all for reading.

Hi guys so this may be a silly question but here it goes

Goal: raising credit score

(Balance/limit)

Debt - card one $800/1000
              Card two $250/500
              Card three: $250/500

I have $500 to pay off some of this debt. What would better impact my credit score - should I make a large payment to the card with higher balance, or should I basically pay off the other two cards? Does it make any difference at all?

Trying to get smarter about my finances.  Currently maxing out my 401(k) but trying to learn more about the backdoor conversions as I currently make too much money to directly contribute to a Roth IRA directly.

Currently, my employer retirement plan allows pre-tac 401(k) contributions and post-tax Roth contributions.  I am also able to make in plan conversions.  Would those Roth post-tax contributions count for mega backdoor contributions?  If I make contributions to that post-tax Roth, can I convert to the Roth IRA and take advantage of the MBR?

Looking for budgeting advice.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gq5v6g/moving_out_on_my_own_next_year_and_pretty/,14,"I'm a 23 y/o college student who will be moving out of my parent's home in June of next year and getting my own apartment, living alone. I have lived with roommates in the past and for my own quality of life just don't consider it worth the money I'd save. However, I'm also slightly concerned about making things work with my income and expenses. Here's the breakdown:

**Monthly net income:**

$1975 a month from primary job

$510 average a month from my stipend ($775 a month from working a graduate assistantship within my program, but only 8 months out of the year)

**Planned Monthly Expenses:**

Rent: $1200

Utilities: $250

Groceries: $350

Personal Loan: $115

Gas: $100

Gym + other monthlies: $50

Car insurance (car is paid off): $160

Miscellaneous/Unexpected shit: $100

Total monthly income: $2485

Total monthly expenses: $2325

So, yeah. Those two numbers are a little closer together than I'd like, but then again I am a grad student so I never really expected to be living the rich life. Luckily my assistantship also covers all of my tuition fees for grad school, so no worries there. I also have been fortunate enough to amass some savings while living with my parents, and according to my current budget I'll have a pinch over $12,000 in savings the day I move into my new apartment in June. I'm finding some solace in that money as a buffer, although I'm also not sure what to do with it, as right now what I have so far is just sitting in a 5.25% HYSA. Maybe I should be investing some of it? I'm really quite clueless there.

So, what do you make of all this? If this were you, would you be absolutely fucking panicking, and looking to do whatever possible to reduce your expenses? I haven't actually picked an apartment yet, and could find a cheaper one in a less pleasant area, or in cities much further from my university and place of work. Might that be worth it? $1200 rent is really just the figure I have in mind right now that I know will get me a nice enough place in a decent enough location, it's not set in stone.

And what should I be doing right now with whatever money I do have left over? This is going to be my rough budget for the next couple years (hopefully some raises / increased stipends as I move further along, but that's not a guarantee). What would you do if you were a 23 year old college student banking like $150 a month, with $12k in savings to begin with? How do I set myself up to have a more financially secure future, or is it even possible given my current situation?

I guess I really just don't know if this is a good, decent, or horrible financial situation to be in as a college student in this day and age. I have nothing to compare it to. I'm also not great with finances in general, so any investing advice or advice at all with what to do with money I do have in savings would be very appreciated! If you hate my expenses list or think i'm neglecting something important, please also let me know! Thanks!",2024-11-13 05:32:15

I’ve been there for him through it all and really gave it my all to help him. I try not to blame myself for what happened, but it’s really hard not to ask myself if I did enough. After all the nights processing this and barely getting any sleep I have only now been able to look into the finance part of it all.

My brother had a life insurance policy that he signed over two years ago. I received a call not too long after his passing from the insurance company asking to confirm some details regarding myself. After it was all done it only took around a week and a half for the insurance money to be paid out. The amount I received is around 1 million USD.

I’m only 22 and I have no idea what to do next. My brother was 26 and only left his car and no debt.

To clarify this is not in the US.

EDIT: Thanks for all the help with this. I’m getting some questions about whether or not insurance is paid out if death is by suicide and here in my country life insurance is only paid out if the insurance has been active for at least 12 months. Again, the money is already paid out and the insurance company has the documents regarding my brother’s death so this is not an issue.

Insurance payments here are also not taxable so this is not a concern either.

FINAL EDIT: Thank you all for the helpful advice and kind private messages. It means a lot to me to read all of it. I will not delete this post as this is a throwaway account and maybe it might be of some help to someone else in the future, hopefully under different circumstances.

1) they say live below your means otherwise you will grow with spending more than you earn even when you get more income. 

I personally doubt it tbf, because yes now i'm living beyond my means but at the same time, I really don't see myself spending much more when I start earning more. For now I get a scholarship of 700€ a month besides rent. I usually spend them all and start withdrawing from the savings account every month. But when I start working, the starting salary of my field is around 3500€, which is way more than what I spend now. With that amount I see myself saving money even because may be i will raise my expenses to 1500..2000 max. 

2) they say to never buy a house or don't buy it till late in life

Why is that the case? if I buy it with a mortgage that I will be paying each month like any other rent, but I will end up with a property under my name.

personalfinance,1gpuzjq,Struggling conceptually to figure out the value of a pension compared to traditional retirement vehicle like a 401(k) - any guidance would be appreciated.,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gpuzjq/struggling_conceptually_to_figure_out_the_value/,7,"In brief, I'm a government employee with a pension working on a spreadsheet to help with decision-making surrounding retirement and career planning. One thing I'd like to do is ""value"" a pension payment, but I'm struggling to appropriately account for all of the variables.

Here are some generic numbers I'm working with:

* Current pension amount at age 40 with 10 years of service: $10,000/year if I retire at 57
* Next year's pension amount at age 41 with 11 years of service $12,000/year if I retire at 57
* After retirement, the pension increases/decreases slightly per year based on investment performance, averaging around 2.5% increases. For convenience, I'm assuming this is roughly equal to the rate of inflation.
* Assume rate of return is 7%.

My underlying question is: what's the present value of that additional $2,000? I'm only focused on year-over-year right now. Basically, assume I quit now vs. next year: what's the financial impact of that decision.

Here's how I'm approaching it:

* First, figure out the value when I'm 57 then calculate the present value today based on a reasonable rate of return for a 401(k).
* At 57, $2,000 per year could be made equivalent to a value using the 4% rule (that you should only withdraw 4% of your 401(k) and increase for inflation). Thus, it's worth $50,000 at age 57. I calculate the present value of $50,000 in 17 years at 7% return to be $15,828.72. This is what I'm leaning towards as a more correct value for retirement planning. I recognize the 4% rule often leaves a lot of money behind, though.
* Alternatively, life tables suggest I'm going to live 22.71 years after age 57. Would that make the total payout $45,420 at the age of 79.71 (or roughly $69,700 with annual increases). This would make the present value under $5,000 if I do the value at age 80. This seems wrong.
* If I do plug and play work not using a formula and try to figure out how much I would need to invest now, assuming a 7% return, and assuming I take out $2,000 per month beginning at 57 for 23 years, I get $7636.56. When I adjust that $2,000 for the 2.5% yearly increase, I get a value of $9450.86. That is, if I started with $9,450.86, got a return of 7% per year, and began withdrawing $2,000 at age 57, $2,050 at age 58, etc., I'd have $0 at age 80. I have no idea how this math works though - again, this is just plugging in numbers until I get the right result.

So, what's the value of working an additional year if I receive an additional $2,000 per year, for life, increasing at 2.5% per year, when I retire at age 57?

Sorry if this is confusing - happy to clarify if I need to.

* **Living Situation:** Currently living with family but expect to start paying housing-related bills within the next 1-2 years, about to graduate debt-free with my bachelors but immediately seeking to get a Masters in NC.
* **Current Expenses:** I cover groceries, gas, and car insurance (I own my car outright). Minor purchases from Amazon, the occasional sandwich, etc.
* **Credit History:** I have a credit card from a joint account with my mother, but I want to build my credit score independently. My credit score is stagnant right now, neither increasing or decreasing.
* **Financial Habits:** I’m diligent with my money and have substantial savings.

personalfinance,1gq1wlv,Advice on selling a used car?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gq1wlv/advice_on_selling_a_used_car/,1,"I was just gifted a car. It’s a few years older than mine and has some cosmetic issues but it’s in great shape and it’s freaking free.

I already have a 2014 Kia Optima that I financed 5 years ago and have 2505 left on the loan. I’m currently making a monthly payment of $230.95

When I was offered the free car, I thought about taking it and selling my KIA just so I could not have a car payment. 

I’m 33, currently making my about $2600/mo with no savings and about 50k in debt (mostly school, and some credit and medical bills).
 I’m barely getting by so saving $230/mo plus the difference in insurance would be huge.

My question is this-

The Blue Book value is $4800-7100 for poor/fair and I’m seeing really good condition 2014 Kia Otpimas going for 8-10k in my area. 
Carmax has offered me $2800, which will cover the $2505 loan and have almost $300 left over which will covered registration, so I’ll have $195 left over.

I’m also going to look into a dealership. 

My other option is to sell it privately. It will take longer and be more demanding. 

The issue is the car has some issues. There’s a few cosmetic things that need to be fixed, scratches on the rear wheel well and door, and front bumper. A broken exterior key lock, a malfunctioning window motor and the car needs new brakes. And it needs a good cleaning inside too. 

But it has brand new tires and a brand new battery. 

I do not have the funds to fix most of this, though upon doing researching and talking with a friend I could possibly fix the cosmetic stuff for $50-70. 

But I figure I could put the car up privately for $5k and see what offers I get. I just don’t know if I want to foresake the Carmax offer and lose out on a purchase amount that covers my loan (other similar companies offered less money).

Hopefully this all makes sense and I can get some input on the best decision to make. 

Do i take the money and run or try and make more money and sell it privately?

Also im under the belief that I would have to pay off the loan to sell the car and I don’t have the money to do that so selling it privately may not even be an option. 

Any advice?",2024-11-13 01:57:01

These are major renovations: 1900ish home, new plumbing & electricity, HVAC, outside lead paint abatement and new paint. That is phase one and gets us a certificate of occupancy. There are other projects we plan to do (like actually having a kitchen & tuckpointing the foundation), We may use the HELOC for some of those Phase 2 projects. We do not have the savings to pay for these renovations up front. They are not DIY stuff. “Fun” renovations will be paid for in cash in the future. We will also use some of the funds to buy a used car because we need a second car. We will not use it for anything else. I plan on making higher payments on the HELOC to pay it off quicker.

I own my house outright. I paid around $100000 in the early 2000s and our neighborhood has gentrified to a ridiculous degree. Comparable renovated homes have recently sold for close to a million. 

We have a list of questions to ask. Are there any other questions I’ve left out? Any advice you can give or things to be careful about. Any reason (besides rate changes) you’d recommend a fixed HELOC over a variable? Any bank or credit union you'd recommend?

What is the CVTV?

What is the margin?

If it’s a teaser rate, how long?

How frequent is the rate adjustment?

What is the length of the draw and payment period?

Is there an initial draw requirement?

Do we need to have a minimum outstanding loan balance during the draw period?

How do we access the funds? 

Is there a monthly/annual limit on number of draws?

Are there any other monthly or annual fees?

Is there an early termination fee?

What is the interest rate cap?

What are the closing costs? Who pays?

Is there a minimum monthly payment?

Can we refinance to a fixed rate HELOC or home equity loan?

I won't elaborate too much unless you have questions.

I am a full-time, Army civilian employee as well as a 100% disabled veteran. So, I make about $60k annually at my job and my disability is around $49k annually. Currently, I contribute 10% of my salary to the TSP (government retirement investments) and 5% of that is matched by employer; by the way, all of this is in a Roth TSP.

With the TSP, I will pay a 10% tax penalty for any early withdrawals; which is any withdrawal prior to turning 59 1/2.

Pending something crazy, I essentially have my disability for life at $49k (annual increase/inflation/etc.).

Here is my thought, and your question. Should I be putting any money at all into this TSP (or IRA) or should I put it into an individual investment account? I ask this based on having the disability and considering the possibility of having a growing investment account I could tap at any time without penalty (or let grow and add to my retirement income).",2024-11-13 03:37:22

Looking for advice on purchasing a car for the first time. I just turned 23 and have been working for about a year now. Previously, I was living at home with family and borrowing my parent's car to get to/from my local university. Now that I've had a little bit of time to build up some money I've been looking into the market to get a new(ish?) car in the next few months. 

Currently, I have about 6k cash in savings/checking accounts and 16k in a personal investment account. Most of my income either goes into that investment account, or my Roth IRA and 401(k). 

  
I've narrowed what I'm looking for down to a clean title accord or camry that is at most a couple years old. The price range for that in my area is generally around 20k-30k depending on trim, year, and seller. I've asked around with friends who have bought their own cars, my parents, and other folks and have heard lots of different advice.    

So far what I'm leaning towards doing is selling \~12k in stocks, setting some aside for capital gains tax, then combining that with my next couple paychecks + the current cash in my bank account to get around 20k by the end of this year. After factoring in dealer fees and taxes, I'm aiming to still be able to put down at least 15k and finance the rest. I'll also be keeping my eyes open in marketplace in case I see a good deal from a private seller and can just pay in full.

I am looking into how to best manage my fiancé and I’s money after tying the knot.

My current retirement money will remain mine since it is a pre-martial asset, but I am unsure if the best way to split our marital assets is to create a joint Roth IRA and contribute the max to that or if I should keep our Roths separate.

Around 2017, I landed a job which increased my salary ~15% from where I had been and then landed three promotions within 6 or 7 years.  I now hold a senior group management type position with 3 direct reports and also an insanely high increase in work responsibility which wasn’t until recently.  After the promotions and “market adjustment”, I practically doubled my salary from where I started in 2017.  Let’s say ~100k gross salary starting in like spring 2024.

Since 2020, I paid off 10-15k in credit card debt I had racked up living solo.  I now maybe allow a few bucks in interest to accrue, mostly if I forget to pay ahead.  I have saved up half my salary, ~50-55k in my bank with another 6-7k cash saved in a secure location (I’m a boyscout, be prepared).  401k upped to 10% contribution and 5% match so it has increased 4-5 fold in short time.

So, with the housing market the way it is, and the rates lowering with potential to go back up… what would you do if you had this?

I’ll try to simplify. 
As title says. 5 years ago, I(37m) landed a job in the field I wanted to work in. As you can tell by my age, it took “awhile”. I spent my 20s in jobs outside my desired field to get by. Companies that offered retirement opportunities/401k matches etc. I went through all of that on early withdrawals while trying a few years in RE. So started at Zero at 32. 
Fast forward now. I haven’t put much in the past 5 years, met a girl, and now married in Oct. Looking to set up myself in the right direction. Currently with $15k in employer 401k. 
My main question is: Many posts say to max the employer 401k match. However my company doesn’t offer a match, because of the pension. I’ll add I am staff at a Union, so I do not contribute into the pension but I do receive it upon retirement. (I feel so blessed for this as I never expected to have a job that offers a pension these days)
Do I first contribute to my 401k or start with a Roth IRA first, max that, then go to the 401k?
My company offers a traditional 401k and a Roth 401k(which I never heard of before this)
So, 401k max then go the Roth IRA?
I know the IRA offers more fund options, but I’m not trying to get too fancy. More, set and forget. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated!

* Building up a savings and emergency fund
* Building a strong credit profile
* Getting rid of debt

I'm currently a software engineer making 120k annually, virtually all of my excess money so far has been going into an emergency fund as layoffs are a big worry in the industry. I have a few options I've considering:

1. Paying 55/mo for 10 years, in total paying about 1100 in interest: This is probably the best for my short-term safety and savings and the worst for having a loan over my head for 10 years.
2. Paying 330/mo for about 2 years and only paying 200 or so in interest: Would put a damper on the amount I can save in the sort term but allow me some time to add to my credit history before the loan is closed.
3. Paying it off in full. Sacrificing my credit history in the short term and almost cutting my savings in half for peace of mind.
4. Paying off 55/mo until HYSAs drop below 3.7% then raising payment/paying off in full

We manage/clean the property ourselves. Even through the covid years, we generally were turning a profit sometimes a decent one. however last year demand started reducing and we just broke even (This property is near a major ski area and it was a very bad winter for skiing conditions) and this year has been terrible with most months losing money. Even with us no longer using the property ourselves we don't get enough bookings to cover expenses.  there's just too much competition combined with reduced demand. I would love to hang on to the property for another 5 years until my kids start graduating highschool but the debts are mounting in an unsustainable way.  We're hoping to recoup some losses this winter since ski season is our highest occupancy (in theory) but come spring it will be decision time.

Options.

**Sell -** We owe about 235K (Mortgage rate of 3.6%). the valuation from Zillow is about 495k. This is a second home so we'd take a tax hit. I would likely take the money and pay off any debt and invest the rest in the stock market.

**Convert -** Switch to a long term rental and hope for a good and stable renter. The rental estimate on zillow is $3,300 (If that's to be believed)? Monthly mortgage is 1575, adding some utility expenses we still stand to be making money again if we find a good Tennent. Downside is losing access to the house for personal use and the risks of not finding a Tennent or getting a bad one and having to deal with eviction .

**Hold -** Keep it as a short term rental for a while longer and see if we can outlast the competition until the economy recovers and demand returns. October total rental income for the property was just over 1k which after expenses puts us at around a $800-$900 loss for that month. Fall and spring tend to be slower with summer and winter being higher occupancy. overall the occupancy trend this year has been bad. 30-50% fewer bookings Y/Y and probably 1/3 of the bookings we saw during the good years. Basically if things don't get better we can expect a spring that would set us back 2-3k

1. Do I include both my personal plus employer contributions as part of my annual savings (i.e. $30,000)?

2. Or, do I only include my personal contributions (i.e. $15,000)?

3. Or, do I not include any pension contributions as savings, and I need to save $22,000 annually on top of pension savings?

Not considering bankruptcy or debt relief companies like National Debt Relief because I've read too many bad experiences with using a third party for debt relief.

I recently read this Slate article: [https://slate.com/business/2024/08/credit-card-debt-negotiate-companies-lenders-minimize-payments-pay-off-accounts.html](https://slate.com/business/2024/08/credit-card-debt-negotiate-companies-lenders-minimize-payments-pay-off-accounts.html) and feel inspired (but apprehensive) to try this method. In summary, the writer recommends intentionally not making a credit card payment until 90 days past due to negotiate a settlement lump sum payment that's 30-50% of the debt owed. This feels risky but with the way inflation and interest rates are right now, plus the fact that I may no longer have access to public student loan forgiveness here pretty soon, I'm not interested in paying back every cent of this debt if there's another option. This is no longer an issue about my budgeting, I have long since cut way way back on my spending, and now I'm just drowning in the accruing interest.

My question: Who has been successful with this lump sum settlement method and what are your recommendations for me moving forward? This is my first month of missed credit card payments. I spoke to both of my banks today to inform them that I'm aware of the missed payments and am concerned about my ability to pay my debts in full. Banks are BECU and Bank of America.

I also worked earlier in the year, and for that job I did complete forms for, and taxes were already deducted from that income (I'm unsure if this is relevant).

Per the title, I'm starting a new job soon and the company doesn't offer the typical benefit package. They offer PTO and paid holidays as well as short-term incentive(annual bonus), but don't provide health, dental, vision, life, short- or long-term disability, 401k (did I forget any other typical benefit?).


Instead, they offer an allowance to cover health insurance and a ""pension"" (that's the term they used) where they'd deposit 7.5% of my annual salary into an investment account of my choice (Edward Jones, Fidelity or the like). 


The company has very few US employees and my understanding is that they're not obligated to provide health insurance. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out quite a few things. 

HEALTH INSURANCE 

I was able to negotiate the annual allowance to $7k a year. Based on the research I've done and the two brokers I talked to, that should be enough to cover at least 90% of my costs. That said, I was originally considering getting coverage with HSA, but after reading more into it, because the deduction would be happening post payroll, it may not be the best way to invest my money since I'd be paying extra into SS and Medicare and wouldn't be able to recoup that when filing taxes. 

My question is -- is paying extra for health insurance with HSA (we're talking $100-200 more per month) worth it in the long run? For reference, I'm mid 40s, no illness. Insurance would be used for emergencies and preventative care. 

401K 

I suck at investing and will need to figure it all out in the next 6 months. I've always replied on employer provided 401k so I'm completely clueless. 

I'll start getting the 7.5% 6 months into my employment. Do I just let it go into an investment account? What else can I do with it? 

My main concerned is being having to pay more taxes because nothing will be deducted at the payroll level. Any advice or recommendations are appreciated.

Edit: This is not a scam job. It's a senior leadership role for a well established company (abroad) looking to gain ground in the US. Pension is their terminology so disregard it if it doesn't make sense in the US. ",2024-11-12 22:37:15

I stupidly tried to mobile deposit this check by taking pics of the front/back of the check off of my laptop because this person sent me a picture of the check, not the physical thing, which I did not know was an issue, although in hindsight it makes sense. Of course, a few hours later, I get an email from Wells Fargo saying that they are closing not only my checking account, but also my savings because they say the checks seems to be altered. So I called the bank, and the lady told me essentially that in order to keep my account I'd have to provide them with the paper check and that if I cannot provide this within a week, they'd close both my accounts. Unfortunately, this person will not send me the paper check and I'm starting to think it was probably fake, so I understand why the bank rejected it. I'm just trying to figure out what to do because they've also blocked any withdrawals or deposits, and since I won't be able to provide the physical check, I know for certain they will eventually close my account. I'm worried, I know I can open another bank account before this one closes, which I will do, but I am supposed to receive my paycheck TOMORROW, so even though I went in and changed my bank information at my job, I fear it's already too late for tomorrow's paycheck. And since I can't withdraw or send money from my Wells Fargo, I really don't know what to do.

The primary job here was moving the couch down several flights of stairs, because moving it out of my apartment itself was supposed to be fairly easy. However, they didn’t realize (and I was incredibly stupid not to oversee it better) that it could simply slide through my doorway on its side, and instead thought they had to force it through the doorway vertically. This ended up tearing up my hardwood floors, cracking my \~100 year old stained glass transoms in the doorframe, causing the wood trim beam holding up the transom to loosen/wiggle, and there’s some fairly deep gauges in the wall where plaster/paint is falling out.

I’m unsure of what this damage would cost to fix, but I’m assuming a few thousand (the stained glass transom repair alone is probably pretty rough). TaskRabbit said to get their Happiness Guarantee, I have to first file a claim with my insurance. My deductible is $1k, and I’ve heard since I have no claims, my premiums will go way up if I make one, so I really don’t want to do that. I'm also thinking my insurance might not even accept the claim -- I think the stained glass breaking etc. wouldn't be considered accidental damage and would fall under the exception for ""Faulty, inadequate or defective workmanship, repair, construction, renovation, remodeling, grading or compaction."" Is there maybe a way to get an official denial without a claim?

I recently left my corporate job to go full freelance, and thus took a moderate hit to my income (I am okay with this - that place was horrible, and the mental/physical benefits of not being there are already worth it). I had a 401(k) there and want to continue saving for retirement, but definitely won't be near maxing out anything soon.

I'm having trouble figuring out what the best plan would be for me - it seems like all the advice online is geared towards putting in the highest possible contribution. I am nowhere near that - tbh, I could probably only do about 2-3% of my income right now, but it's better than nothing. The idea is that eventually my client base will grow and I can increase my fees, or I'll give up and go back to a (hopefully better) ""normal"" job in a few years.

Since I'm self-employed, I'm also looking for ways to lower my taxes since those are so much higher for me now too. I know that the plans are taxed differently, but I can't quite figure out the short vs long term impacts of each.

My salary is slightly higher than his, although he receives additional income through his business but it’s not consistent (a few thousand every other month or so). Overall our incomes are roughly the same so we’ve always split everything 50-50. 

We have not combined finances completely. We contribute the same amount to all household purchases, rent, bills, etc and whatever is left over we put into our own separate savings/investments or spend for personal fun things. 

Overtime, I’ve been more frugal and have saved up quite a lot more than him. He on the other hand reinvested a lot of his savings back into his business. 

Onto the current issue is that if we buy a house, I’d be contributing 80% of the downpayment and him 20% based on what we have saved. I’m not sure what’s a good way to handle this disparity. On the one hand, I do believe in our marriage but on the other hand, I don’t want to lose the bulk of my savings if something does happen. I believe our state would automatically treat this as a joint marital asset and would disregard the unequal downpayment contribution.

My mother recently had a stroke. This has brought to light how atrocious her finances are and the lengths she's gone to hide it. Present day, she has over $200k in debt, and I've begun consulting a lawyer to possibly declare bankruptcy.

Going forward, I will most likely have to be involved in her finances to ensure this doesn't happen again, which she is fully on board for. I guess what I'm asking is, what would be the best way to do this? Some sort of trust or monitored account? I'm overwhelmed with the current medical and financial issues and don't know where to start. I also don't live in the same state, so I would need remote accessibility.

I am financially  responsible, so I will be the one to take it on, but I'm no expert when it comes to extremes such as this. We thought it would be a simple budget and paying a few past due accounts that defaulted while she was hospitalized. 

She recently signed a rental lease with my sister and her family, who relies on her portion of rent (I'm shocked the property management company even approved my mother). She sold her home last year, so the only property she has at the moment is her vehicle, which we will be selling as it is wildly out of her budget.

My thought is now to roll over the accounts from previous employers into a single Roth/IRA account. Would it be wise to call either Schwab or Prudential to open an IRA account and then transfer my remaining 401(k) balances? 

The balances in each account are not much, only about $4,000 in one account and $15,000 in the other, so would this be the wisest use of this money? I also have <$3,500 in stocks and ETFs in a Robinhood account, but I don’t have immediate plans to move those investments. 

INFO: I also have about $4,000 in credit card debt, but I know generally it is bad to use retirement savings to pay down debt. This new job has increased my salary from mid-$50,000s to low-$70,000s, and my credit card helped me finance a move across the country, as well as some other expenses racked up before this job. It just feels like that last bit of my CC balance is the only thing standing between me and my savings goals so I feel like paying down the balance now might set me up better for my long-term goals.

I'm hoping my financial aid, particularly Pell Grants, will cover most of that—I'll know more soon.

However, I still want to move to Tennessee for personal reasons. My new plan is to attend WGU online while living in Tennessee. If I take a part-time job, rent a modest apartment, and use student loans to cover the remaining costs that financial aid doesn't, do you think this is a reasonable approach?

I’m 36 years old, living in NYC, and making $185,000 + bonus. Despite feeling pretty burned out, I’ve managed to build a solid financial foundation and want to better understand my retirement options and whether I’m on track to retire comfortably in the next 10-15 years, or sooner if possible.

Here’s an overview of my financial situation:

* **Annual expenses:** \~$90k (working on cutting this down)
* **Cash savings:** \~$50k in a HYSA
* **Retirement/brokerage accounts:** \~$400k, primarily invested in VTSAX or similar
* **Rental properties:** \~$1M in equity, generating \~$40k/year in net rental income
* **Loan:** $150k mortgage on one rental property at a 5.25% interest rate
* **No other debt**

I feel financially secure and don’t have other debts besides the mortgage. I have a long-term partner, and children are still very much TBD. My partner makes more than I do, so I don’t need to worry about supporting them. While I’m not aiming to retire immediately, I would love to understand when I might be able to comfortably retire based on my current trajectory. I have used some of the calculators, but it's hard for me to make sense of them.

How do you think my savings, investments, and income will play out in the long term? When do you think I could potentially retire comfortably without compromising my financial goals? Honestly, I'm looking for more of a sanity check than anything else, as I don't have many people to discuss my finances with and work is really affecting my mental health.

It's both the spouse and I's decision, as we both work for the same company. We're both high earners with a 44% effective tax rate (federal  + state + local + FICA).

PPO: $2000 Annual Premium, Deductible $750, Out of Pocket Max $3000

HDHP: $1625 Annual Premium, Deductible $2000, Out of Pocket Max $4000. Employer contributes $400 to HSA.

So, assuming we both dump $3900 into our HSAs, we get $3800 back in free money (essentially $4300 / (1-effective tax rate)) = $7700-$3900 initial contribution = $3800 saved on taxes back.

No matter what we do with our insurance, unless the PPO was $200 out of pocket max, the HDHP would come out ahead.

Am I right in this logic? The HDHP is always better, then. I don't want to mess this up since there are two major expected costs  next year. I may need advanced imaging and a surgery and the spouse may get pregnant. Because of this, the spouse thinks we should do the PPO, but on paper, the HDHP is better no matter what by my numbers. Although the PPO seems nice not having to pay upfront that's not an issue for us, and the HDHP always works out in favor of itself by my numbers.

Context. My wife and I have 7 kids. She is a SAHM. I work in consulting. I'm thankful that I make enough that we have *some* extra and can save a *little*, but we pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. 

We know how to be frugal. Until 3 years ago, we lived on $70k and then my pay more than doubled. We allowed ourselves to catch up on some expenses we deemed necessary (braces for our kids, a third car (we have 5 drivers and our kids had trouble getting jobs without reliable rides).

personalfinance,1gps69m,How much % of monthly income to justify spending on rent to move out of biohazard hoarder house?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gps69m/how_much_of_monthly_income_to_justify_spending_on/,30,"
I live in a house with abusive hoarder parents where in addition to the hoard things are dirty, Dusty, and they don’t take care of whatever breaks in the house so if pipes break or water leaks they just let the home get water damaged, also because they don’t want anyone coming in the house to fix anything due to the hoard. There is barely any room to walk around and I can’t use restroom or wash hands when I need. My doctor recently found that my lungs were inflamed probably because of the environment I live in, but of course we don’t know if it’s a direct correlation. I’m in my mid 20s and female and I feel like I can’t fully enjoy life here and I feel I’m wasting so much time because I can’t be fully functional. My quality of life is terrible. I can’t even cook because the stoves are blocked with random stuff. I have 2 jobs and don’t make a ton of money but make enough to barely cover renting a studio apartment in my area (I live in HCOL but it’s safe and my doctors are out here and I have health issues so I’ll need to stay in this area, but I also can’t start my treatments or taking my health management seriously until I have a clean place because I don’t have access to certain resources in this house to do those treatments). 

I have done the math, after my rent and utilities and expenses (groceries, fun money, health insurance premiums, car insurance) are paid (this is using my income after taxes) I’ll have about $400-500 left in savings give or take. I have a third job where I can pick up hours when I want but I don’t want to overwork myself to the bone especially because I’m already limited in energy and health. I’ve always been an aggressive saver so that amount feels super low but my mental and physical health is going down the drain rn. 

I know rent should be only thirty percent of monthly gross income (maybe forty if HCOL) but I’d be spending about 65% after tax income on housing if I move, but I know especially in this economy, that “30% rule” doesn’t apply to many and I don’t think it takes into account those needing to get out of dangerous or abusive situations. Roommates are also a no because of my health issues I don’t have capacity to deal with not being in full control over my space and who is inviting who over, if roommate gets contagiously sick they can pass it to me and with my chronic condition that would not end well, etc.

I don’t mind spending more on housing and cutting other costs because If I go out I do free things, I don’t go in vacation except locally once a year (a trip that costs about 300 dollars max), and I only spend on budget foods, and I would cook a lot. I also would still live near my parents and they go out to eat a lot so I’d have plenty leftovers from them since I’d probably want to see them more and eat with them more because I’d have my own clean space to come back to (so my monthly food bill will be low in general). I WFH and cuz of my health can’t drive too far or too long with my own car so I’d spend very little on gas. I bought my car (a very reliable car that has good mileage and isn’t a gas guzzler) in full because it’s used so I only have to pay insurance on it which I am currently looking for a cheaper rate through my company since they partner with a certain insurance co. 

Also I’m not into doing nails/hair dye, buying clothes, etc and am a minimalist so i would only give myself like 10-20 bucks a month to make an “impulse” purchase on something  fun if I really need. I have no CC debt and have almost 20K in a high yield savings account that I will only touch in emergency but always replenish as well. I eventually want to start investing small amounts into 401k, stocks and some kind of funds. My company does 401k matching too. 

The rent for the place I’m thinking of is low for the area but would be about 65% of my after tax income (this also includes Wi-Fi/utilities) since I’d live on my own, but also the home I’m in currently is a health hazard and i WFH so I need a clean space to be in since I’m home most of the day. I’m trying to justify this but it’s hard to make a decision. I know many people spend lots per month on something, whether it be drinks, clothes, vacations, and for me it would be a clean place to live. Because of my health issues I honestly don’t even think I’ll be alive till retirement age so I’m ok with not putting huge amounts of money away for retirement. I don’t want kids and I don’t ever desire to buy a house later either. Just curious for anyone’s input or if you were in similar situation. I’ve also applied to many affordable housing complexes (you can get income based housing even if you make 80-90K here because of the HCOL, and I’m on the waitlists for most of them, but those waitlists are 3+ years long, some are 8 to 10 years, and I rly can’t take another 3 months here). Has anyone been in a similar situation or can give input? 

EDIT: Thank you for all your helpful input, please feel free to keep doing so as I am working on responding to them but I'm just editing this to say thank you and also I just found another studio in a different complex today that is about 300 dollars cheaper (give or take) regarding utilities. It is missing some features (I'd prefer to have W/D in the studio but this one has laundry room, but this one gives a personal garage for your car that is included in rent meanwhile the more expensive place has a parking garage). SO I'm weighing some pros and cons. But if I go with the one I just found I'd be able to save abut 300 dollars more each month.

My pay type was changed this year from hourly to salary to meet FLSA regulation. My new pay rate was calculated correctly, however because of the timing (effective 7/16 - 7/31 pay period), I am effectively getting paid for 2076 hours instead of the 2088 hours I would have been paid for this year (Yearly compensation runs from 12/1 - 11/30).

I've spoken to HR and they have repeatedly said their calculations are correct and that they are following industry standard, however, this feels like a retroactive pay cut. I've pointed that out and asked the issue to be escalated, but I anticipate they will return with the same answer.

Is there anything I can do or say that could get HR to budge on the issue?

personalfinance,1gpocnq,Question regarding first time filer as MFJ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gpocnq/question_regarding_first_time_filer_as_mfj/,4,"Subject: Filing Status Change to Married Filing Jointly for 2024 and Its Impact on Tax Rate

Hello everyone,

I recently got married and plan to file as Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) for the 2024 tax year. My wife currently does not have any income, so it will primarily be based on my income alone.

Currently, I earn approximately $170,000 annually, and under the single filing status, I fall within the 24% federal tax bracket. I understand that the tax system in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that income is taxed at different rates depending on the bracket it falls into.

However, I have not yet updated my tax status with my employer, so I’m still being taxed as a single individual, which I assume results in a higher withholding rate. Given my income level, I believe that switching to MFJ should place me in a lower tax bracket of 22% for a portion of my income.

My main question is:
	•	Once I file as MFJ, will my taxes adjust so that I am charged based on the married tax rate (i.e., 22%) rather than the higher rate I am currently paying as a single filer?
	•	Given my current tax situation and income, should I expect a significant tax refund for the 2024 tax year, since my tax rate should decrease from the 24% bracket to the 22% bracket?

Any insights into how this change might affect my overall tax liability and whether I can anticipate a larger tax refund would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your guidance!

My math states that I should get back about 9-10k on return .

We never had a strong relationship but we would catch up after a bit. All this to paint a picture that I could go months to a year without knowing what he was up to. I got a phone call yesterday for a wellness check. 

The police reached out to both my sister and I. Without thinking too much of it I tracked down my aunt who was the only person he would talk to on a somewhat regular basis (at least every couple of weeks). She was trying to find his spare keys (she had a copy). Before she could make it up there my sister authorized a forcible entry via a window ac unit. Long story short he was found dead by the police and it was for some time.

He was isolated and alone. My mother and him divorced a long time ago. He didn't have anyone. My sister and I are his only kids. He has siblings too. He didn't have much for an estate so dealing with this via probate seems like over kill. What I do know, he has a mortgage on his home, he was on disability and never really worked. He probably had some money for personal stuff but nothing crazy. Might have enough to cover cremation expenses. Being that no one knows of any legal documents or will the police worked with me during the incident (bc I was his son) and we had a local funeral pick him up. They advised me to immediately change the deadbolt and secure the house and make arrangements today.

* **Savings**: \~€310K available to invest, plus €10K I’d like to keep as cash for immediate liquidity

* **Retirement**: I also have around $85K in a US 401k, which I hope will support me in retirement

**Goal**: I’d like to upgrade to a larger home or villa in a better location (targeting +€1MM) in the next 5-10 years depending how thing's pan out. My plan is to grow my investments now, then hopefully use those returns to cover part of purchase price.

1. **S&P 500 vs. VWCE**: I’m considering both the S&P 500 and VWCE ETFs as options. I feel positive about the long-term US market outlook and am confident in the US economy’s strength (assuming political risks are managed); however, I see VWCE as offering more global diversification (I'm aware US companies are also internationally diversified). Which might be better given my timeline and objectives?
2. **Other Investment Options**: Are there other approaches I should consider, such as diversifying into bonds, REITs, or specific European funds? Given that I’m new to this, any guidance on building a balanced portfolio for medium- to long-term growth would be really, really helpful.
3. **Market Timing**: Is this a good time to invest a significant amount into the market, or should I ease in with smaller monthly contributions?

I know, I know... I'm trying to fix it.

In the past few years, things have gone great for me financially. I'm making >$160k/yr now, and when I sat down and actually did the work, my unpaid tax burden last year was literally like $29. So nothing anyone is gonna care about, and the penalties are trivial.

I, however, want to get current and get shit settled, as I want to get a house if I am so lucky as to be able in the next economic downturn, and I figure that'd be good to do.

As I understand it, if I get current on the six most current years, I'll be safe going forward? 2024 is coming up, so so long as I settle through 2019, I'll be cool with the IRS. Is this true?

2019 is a problematic year for me. I was running a failing self-employed small business (no employees). I really, really, really don't want to have to delve into that financial catastrophe/clusterfuck. It's going to be a forensic accounting nightmare to make sense of it and get it all sorted out. I probably owe at least 10k from that year. I was hand-to-mouth and facing eviction at the time....

Since apparently no one at the IRS has given a shit for a decade, am I better off waiting until 2025 and filing 2020-2025, satisfying six tax returns, or doing the 5 when 2024 tax season rolls around, and hoping I didn't open a can of worms and make myself known to them in such a way that 2019 is gonna be a problem for me?",2024-11-12 04:25:26

This house was always planned to be an investment, we planned even if getting another home to hold onto this house. We're in talks now of buying another house in another state and making it another investment property. 

Ultimately the question is, should I upgrade things in the house that make it more ""green""? I already put smart thermostats in, when the HVAC dies going to put a SEER 16 in, but things like the windows, would that improve rental/selling costs? Is it worth it?

But I did the math and just don't see how PPO is a better option than HDHP with employer HSA contributions. Can you help me double-check my logic for any flaws?

HDHP: 

* Total premium cost for me+spouse (annual): $2,808
* Employer HSA contribution (annual): $3,960
* Deductible: $3,300 individual and $6,600 family(embedded)
* Out of pocket max: $4,000 individual and $8,000 family 
* All visits are 0% co-insurance after deductable 

PPO 250: 

* Total premium cost for me+spouse (annual): $3,984
* Deductible: $250 individual and $750 family(embedded)
* Out of pocket max: $2,250 individual and $4,500 family 
* Co-insurance is 10% for most procedures and delivery 

  
Given that with pregnancy we'll hit the out of pocket max, the most I will pay with HDHP is $2,848 (total premium cost ($2808) + individual OOPM ($4000) - Employer HSA contribution ($3960). That's for individual, given that I stay healthy and deductible is used by spouse only. 

With PPO the least I'll pay is $3,456 plus all the co-insurance and copayments (which are hard to estimate but I assume at least $1000).

I may be overthinking this. But im struggling to understand how to see which of my index funds have been performing the best..

For example. I may have purchased £1000 of a single fund, which is now at £1500, so the return shows as 50%

But i may have bought £1000 of another fund, that increased to £2000, so it was showing 100% return, But then added a further £10,000, so the returns now show as 9% So when i look at my overview. The first fund looks like its performed better. But in actual fact, it was the second fund that performed twice as well.

I do have a few grand in a company directed 401k (target fund 2050-something), but I am thinking it might be better to stop contributing to that, and instead roll it into a self directed 401k and contribute to that after maxing out a Roth IRA, up to 15% of my income. 

Does this strategy make sense? ",2024-11-12 04:39:03

I told the representative my situation and admit it is my fault and didn't know the conditions when signed up for the promo. The rep is nice but the $500 is the lowest she can do. I requested to talk to a supervisor or manager to avoid her from going back and forth during the phone call. Is it worth a try to talk to supervisor?

I’d like to leave this lease without difficulty when the time comes because the thought of staying at this place any longer makes me uneasy. My roommate is a little odd and I definitely don’t want to stay at the same place next year. I thought the contract I signed was for an individual lease per room at first, but upon further analyzing the contract, I’m not sure anymore. My question is, when the lease end date is near, can I serve a 30 day notice to vacate with only my name and signature on it and be liberated from the contract when the lease end date is here? 

Here’s what my lease says - “The terms of this tenancy shall commence on 06/30/2024 and end on 05/31/2025 , and thereafter, shall be month-to-month on the same terms and conditions as stated herein, save any changes made pursuant to law, until terminated.” The month to month part is what is confusing me. I don’t want to be held to this lease if my roommate lags on the notice to vacate or if they want to continue the lease. When I try to ask my leasing office any questions, we seem to not understand each other well or they seem to be going around my question a bit.

Consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: I buy a stock at $5 then sell it at $10, meaning I realize $5 profit. On this, suppose I have to pay $2 capital gains tax. This means I really am taking home $8. Then I buy the stock again at $9. The end result is I am down $1 (since $9 - $8 = $1) and up one stock.

Scenario 2: I buy the stock at $5 and let it sit. The end result is I am down $5 and up one stock.

So even though capital gains tax ate into my profits in Scenario 1, I'm still doing better than if I held right?

The transaction is recorded in the Chase bank app, and I discarded the physical receipt later. After I saw the doctor a minutes later, I purchased a test kit in the same place for $190.

Weeks later in June, I received a bill from the healthcare provider (UHC) saying I owed $75, which I later paid on the UHC app. Per the UHC claims section, the second payment was accepted by the doctor's office a few weeks later.

Then I realized that I ended up paying the same copay twice. Called UHC, and UHC told me to talk to the doctor's office since the second $75 payment was accepted by them. Then I called the doctor's office, and they validated the payment from UHC. 

They also can see the payment of $189 for the kit, but claim that I did not pay a copay of $75. They said I should bring the credit card receipt for that $75 if I am seeking a refund. The Chase app clearly shows that I paid that $75 along with $190 the same day, along with the duplicate UHC payment of $75. No funding was issued whatsoever.

Does anybody have experience with this? 

Ideally, I'd like to roll this into a 529 that i'm still a beneficiary of, so myself or family can use it at a later date with fewer restrictions.

We want to put 500k down, we have the option of taking out a ""Personal Line of Credit"" loan from our brokerage account that would be at 8.5% on the total.  The other option is just selling to pay the down payment.  About 250k are in bond funds that my understanding are tax free, but the other 250k would be taxable income.  Our cost basis across the entire account is around 575k, so I'm unsure how that works if we sell only 250k of worth of taxable stocks.  Currently our holdings are worth 700k in that account.

  
Our annual gross income is around 750k, living expenses are around 100k, we max out our back door Roths, Mega back door Roth, HSA, and 529 accounts for the kiddos. We'd also sell our current home which would likely end up losing us 30-40k as well (Home values dropped and this house was 100% financed at 4%, but we've only been here 3 years so not much off the principle)

I make 26.75/hr @40hours a week and average 10% overtime yearly. I’m making roughly 65k/year right now before taxes. I also own a home that I’m in the process of selling right now because it’s just too far for me driving to work (hour and a half drive). I have 60k in equity on the home and I’ve only owned it 2 years. My realtor is confident I’m going to walk away with 35-40k said and done after closing fees, realtor fees, repairs etc. I owe 140 on the house and it’s worth 200-220 as it sits. I’m not interested in renting it out because my mortgage is only a few hundred dollars cheaper than what it’s worth in rent. So with that out the window and instead selling it, I plan to pay off my car with some of the money (11k) and that would leave me with about 25k bare minimum leftover. I’m staying with my parents to save money after it sells, until I find somewhere to rent closer to work. What should I invest this 25k into is my main question? Work offers 50% match to 401k contributions up to 6k yearly. Should I put 6k into that and get a free 3k? Invest in stocks? Stocks for work are also insane right now. I can’t say exactly where I work but if you can guess which car manufacturer was a heavy red side supporter during the election, than you’d probably figure it out.

My current job pays me 245k total compensation, with mega backdoor Roth option that I have been maxing out (in addition to normal 401k and Backdoor Roth IRA) for the past few years.

I am considering taking a job for 275K total compensation, but no Mega back door 401k (only has the regular 401k).

All the numbers shared are with the benefits of both jobs (e.g. 401k match, HSA contributions, insurance, and other benefits) baked in. So we are truly just comparing the absence of mega backdoor Roth in exchange for 30k total compensation (pre tax). Both are in the same city so no COL differences.

If it matters, I’m 24 years old.
Also please just answer purely from the financial POV, of course other things matter when choosing the job (like career trajectory, wlb, etc.). I’ll consider those factors myself.

My initial thought it to take the extra 30k job, because after tax that’s an additional 20k invested. So it’s either 35k invested in mega backdoor Roth or 55k in standard taxable brokerage.

personalfinance,1gp2xmy,Should I try to buy or keep renting?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gp2xmy/should_i_try_to_buy_or_keep_renting/,11,"I'm in my early 40s, single, no debt, paid off 10 year of Toyota, and living in a HCOL area. I'm trying to decide if I should get serious about trying to buy a place or keep renting the place I'm in until it stops being a good deal (lower than mortgage+condo fees and commuting costs).

I currently rent a 2bd condo for well under market rate. I like it because it's within walking distance of my job, it's pretty private (half-attached), and it has a garage. I've been here a long time now (10+ years) and the owner raises the rent by $100-150 every couple of years.

Housing prices are high where I live (California), so if I try to buy something the best I can probably do is an older condo of equal or smaller size with less privacy several cities over. I'm reluctant to pursue it because I hate commuting, my transportation cost will rise because of the commute, and I'll have to deal with paying for home repairs. I worry that I will run the risk of being house poor even though I plan to keep mortgage+condo fees as close to 28% of gross as I can.

I'm not in love with the idea of home ownership. My reason for pursing it is purely practical. I would like stable(ish) housing cost, especially post retirement. I know that the sooner I buy, the better chance I have to have paid off housing by retirement.

Numbers to help...

* Income: $66,500 gross / $60,100 net
* Rent: $1,400
* Emergency Fund (iBonds): $22,000
* Taxable Investments: $50,000 (for buying house)
* Retirement: $100,000 (RothIRA) + $60,000 (457b) + Pension

Note:  I am currently putting 25% of gross towards retirement (7% pension, 18% 457b)

After some years of hesitating, I was finally ready to reallocate my holdings. I had no problem buying shares of the ETF's recommended by the advisor, but I wanted a couple of traditional mutual funds, as well.

Long story short, I couldn't buy shares of two super common Fidelity mutual funds - ones that I carefully picked.

I was pretty shocked. I understand there are alternatives. But I don't always want an alternative. Sometimes I want the actual fund, for various reasons.

HDHP $46. ($2000 deductible then pays 90%, $4000 out of pocket max)

I see PCP plus one specialist 1-2 times per year usually. No planned procedures or other major medical interventions next year. Take 5 generic prescriptions.

personalfinance,1goy49w,How to efficiently save/plan for the next house,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1goy49w/how_to_efficiently_saveplan_for_the_next_house/,2,"Hi All, 

I have a question about efficiently saving for a new home in a 3-4 year timeline. My wife and I purchased a small condo in April 2023, 2 bedrooms, 925 sqft. We anticipated raising a child there for a while before moving into something bigger down the line. At the time, we could have stretched for a bigger house, but bought very conservatively (current housing costs are at 17% of gross monthly income). Fast forward to 2024 and everything is going according to plan, except we have twins lol. They’re almost 6 months old now, and we’ve gotten our feet under us, however our already tiny space feels smaller and smaller as they grow, need more things to keep them entertained, and start to move around. 

I am looking at ways to save for a future home that fits our bigger family. Most in my area start at 550k. Current mortgage looks like this: 

*Current property value: Guessing 345,000$ (Zestimate is 350,000$)
*Principal remaining: 288,000$
*Interest rate: 6.5%
*18 months into the mortgage, traditional 30-year
*Total current house cost (PITI + HOA) = 2455$

After budgeting our needs and minimizing wants, we can comfortably save an additional 1000$/month toward our next home. We have a healthy emergency fund, plus sinking funds for future cars/vacations etc, and 7k set aside so far for a house, all in a HYSA (5% interest). Would it be best to continue saving in a HYSA considering our 3-4 year time horizon? I know that investing in the market would be too risky, but my other idea was paying the 1000$ per month into our existing mortgage principal. What are the pros and cons? 

I know putting everything toward principal gives me a pretty good guaranteed rate of return, seeing as my interest rate isn’t great. It also gets me out of PMI sooner (though it’s only 40$/month), and avoids taxes on the “gains”. However, it locks all my house funds into the current property, requiring me to sell then buy, as I don’t believe a bridge loan would be that useful unless I see huge asset appreciation in the next few years. It also ties my future home fund to my current house’s value, though I figure that’s the reality no matter where I save the money.

Continuing to save in an HYSA will yield a lower return, be subject to taxes, and also will likely not stay at 5%, though it gives me more flexibility in the buying process (e.g., can buy and sell on a longer timeline, thus potentially getting a better deal on both ends by being more picky). However, I feel as though I’ll have to use my existing home equity to fund my down payment on a next house anyways, considering that’s where most of my house funds already are. 

I hope to refinance if conditions are right, which could potentially change the calculus, but as of right now, am I off base in thinking it makes sense to throw all my future house funds into my existing mortgage?

The difference between 20% and 30% would be about $23k. Currently this money would sit in a HYSA at 4.5%.

personalfinance,1gp2uy6,Cash in 60% of investment (index fund) to pay off student loans?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gp2uy6/cash_in_60_of_investment_index_fund_to_pay_off/,1,"I'm weighing options, and just wanted to hear some other thoughts.

I have about $50k in student loans (currently in forbearance because I was enrolled in the SAVE plan) combined grad and undegrad, for which payments will no doubt start up come the new administration.

I have about $75k in QQQ, of which roughly $19k is investment returns on $56k invested.

I have other savings (not including 401k / retirement) around $25k.

If income driven repayment plans go away-- which is entirely possible-- or at the very least, the SAVE plan is eliminated (which is very likely) then I can expect my payments to jump to somewhere in the neighborhood of $800-900 / month. That's manageable, but it would put a big dent in what I can save each month.

I'm also considering the effect that the new administration's policies will have on *any* investment / the market in general, and the possibility that my $75k investment could dwindle considerably.

So one thought is to just take out roughly 60% of my investment account and just pay the whole lump amount of the student loans ASAP. It would, at minimum, save me a considerable amount of interest (lowest interest rate on any of my loans is 5.4%, highest is 6.8%). And then just focus on rebuilding my investment account / savings.

I may be overblowing things a bit, but I could just use some outside perspective, if someone is willing to give it.

Vital stats: 

* own my home, slightly less than $100k left on the mortgage

* full-time employed, pre-tax income is $87k, expected year-end raise will bring me to ca. $94 / 95k.

* no other debt, no kids, no other obligations

* including employer match, contributing ca. 23% per month to 401k",2024-11-11 20:52:33

I'm nearly 41 and a loser :)  I am working minimum wage (FL) for 29.5 hours a week in a city about 100 miles from home.  I've got a BA (no student loans) but I have gotten all of one interview and 2 replies to submitted resumes since I graduated.  I probably could get a fast food/other customer service job closer to home, but my mental health has been wrecked by those, and even just needing to shop leads to panic attacks pretty quickly, let alone trying to work in it again (and yes, USA, so no mental health care-at least no diagnosis to contend with, I suppose) while I'm trying to figure out a new plan.  I am currently living between my mother and an aunt and they fortunately at the moment are not charging me rent.  My mom pays my vehicle insurance, and when my dad died I just grabbed his spot on the phone plan (though if she decided to stop paying the extra line, I'm still putting like $25 every few months onto my old pay as you go plan to keep it alive).  I had some credit card debt that I just got out of (had to get my wisdom teeth taken out a couple years back and didn't budget right.)  CURRENTLY my credit score is 735, and I have $300 in a savings account.

I was going to make this post to ask how to start squirreling away money for any sort of future plans, but then my car decided to get a cracked head, and I'm going to need a new(er) one pretty much immediately.  There's a mess of drama in my family thanks to that at the moment, but since it happened over the weekend, I still need to talk to my credit union about what I can afford (instead of just dealers like I've done so far) and look around some more.  Ugh.  I hate it.  That should hopefully be my only recurring expense any time soon besides stuff like food or gas, even if I will likely have to take a longer repayment plan, meaning more spent in interest over time.  With what my mom said she could give me as a down payment, if nothing changes, I could get a new car (maintenance included, multiple year warranty, so no mechanic bills any time soon) for between $3-400/month for something that every mechanic I've talked to said will last for ages.  Most of the used cars I've seen that would last ANY period of time are close to that price, but with no warranty or maintenance.  

I've gotten in the habit of eating out too much because the aunt I stay with didn't want me keeping food at her place (but also doesn't want me eating out.  Am I supposed to not eat 3 days a week?) so I AM working to trim that out of my budget and get back to mostly fresh veggies with some rice or pasta, and like eggs or yogurt plus some fruit for my breakfast again.  It's taking time, but I'm eating in more frequently lately, so any progress is good, right?  Ideally, I'd like to get my food budget back to under $100 a month like it was before this, but prices have risen a lot, so I'm not sure that's a reasonable goal at the moment.  I don't spend much on entertainment (like, $1-200 a year, mostly in like, yarn which has multiple month projects or an occasional video game).  I don't wear makeup or have ANY subscriptions, so nothing to cut there.  Um.  I can't remember the last time I bought myself clothing aside from a tee shirt a few months ago, though I definitely need to replace some that is getting worn out.  Bills for my pets (unless something horrible happens) are only a few hundred a year maximum.

What can I do (besides keep wasting my time with resumes and working harder at not eating out) that could potentially help me with mostly future finance?  Mostly, I suppose, how much should I be trying to put into any sort of savings, and should I keep doing just the regular savings account, or find some sort of saving plan (I keep seeing ads for acorns, but that's the only thing I've heard of besides trying to find something like an IRA that I don't know where to START looking for) that would get higher returns for the future?  Do some in each so I have some disposable emergency funds in savings plus a long term plan of some sort for later?  Is there a percent I should be aiming for per month?  Per week?  The acorns ads show anything from just spare change when you're at a store to X% to from $10 a month to $10 a day (yea, the last would be great, but it's not going to happen any time soon.) and it's a bit above my head.

Sorry for this being so long.  I'm trying to do better, but I am not sure where to start, and figured budget would be asked about at some point as well.  ",2024-11-11 20:47:04

As the title says, my grandmother has recently applied for Medicaid in New York. Her application is still under review, although she is already in the long-term care facility. From what what I understand, if she gets approved, then all of her assets are then handed over to Medicaid/NY state. If I'm not mistaken, this includes her checking account and my grandfather's pension, which was transferred to my grandmother after my grandfather passed away.

Luckily, my mom and her siblings set up a trust years ago that has them as being the beneficiaries. My grandmother's house is in the trust along with her investment account. Technically, it's a brokerage account but it's called ""Trust: Under Agreement"" when looking at the account page. This account is invested in bond funds that pay dividends monthly. The dividends are then automatically transferred to my grandmother's checking account monthly.

During the Medicaid application process, they do a 5-year look back of your asset transactions to make sure you don't move around assets before applying for Medicaid.

My question is whether or not stopping the transfer of those dividends to the checking account will raise a red flag with the Medicaid people because they can see that those transfers have been going through for years. In my non-expert opinion, it shouldn't be an issue because the account that the dividends are coming from is already in the trust and Medicaid can't touch any of the money in the trust so they shouldn't be able to touch the dividends either. But, we also don't want her to get denied Medicaid because she needs the assistance.

I'm a 25-year-old woman with a master’s degree, currently working a sales job in a metro city. I make around 65k per month but have a student loan of 22L from my post-grad studies. My job is pretty demanding—six days a week, 12-hour days with intense sales pressure and a hostile work environment—and I’m hoping to leave it as soon as possible.

I live in a shared flat and keep a basic lifestyle, yet saving is still difficult as I prioritize loan payments and essential expenses. My parents, however, expect me to help them with their house and car loans, and I generally send them around 20k monthly. Still, they feel disappointed, saying I should be able to support them more, as they raised me. 

To give more context: my father had a stable job, and both my parents worked in direct marketing, where they made good money at one point. However, the company’s decline drastically reduced their income. Their house and car were bought when their income from marketing was higher, but with that income gone, it’s been a financial strain. They never saved, so the only asset we have is the house, which is on a bank loan. My father also took out loans at high-interest rates to start other businesses, but unfortunately, none of them succeeded.

Meanwhile, I covered my own education through loans, as they couldn’t provide financial support, unlike many of my peers whose families helped. I also had to manage family issues while growing up, often acting as a mediator during my parents' conflicts. Now, as I plan to get married next year, I’d like to save a few lakhs for a modest wedding, but I feel overwhelmed by balancing my financial goals, debt, and family’s expectations.

Any advice on managing this situation, saving better, or communicating these constraints to my family would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.

My situation:

I just started my first attending job as a physician. My Income - $425,000 gross. No student loan or credit card debt. Mortgage of 525,000 but we gutted the entire house (living at my in-laws) and are redoing it which will cost probably another 250 or 300,000 and I might have to take a loan out for the construction. 

Retirement accounts avaialable to me - 403(b) & 457(b). My position is with a non-profit children's hospital, but I don't work for government so I don't believe this is a governmental 457(b).

I have read white coat investor bootcamp book but I just want to clarify my savings and retirement amounts. The book recommends saving 20% of your gross income for retirement. So this means 425,000 x 0.2 = 85,000/year?

Do the contributions to my 403(b) and 457(b) count towards this 85,000?

If I max out 403(b) and 457(b) at 23,500 each thats 47,000. I will backdoor roth for my wife and I both and that will be another 14,000 total. So 47,000 + 14,000 = 61,000. So I additionally need to put aside another 24,000/year that I would put in my vanguard account to invest in index funds/target retirement fund? After getting an emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses set aside, do I need to save any additional money in addition to what I listed above or can the rest of my money be used on bills, wants, needs, etc.

I currently own a fixer-upper lakehouse that I've been slowly renovating, and I'd really hate to lose it forever. 

What's the best way to use my current equity to buy a house in NY without selling? Is that even possible?

Should I focus only on saving for the next year or is it worth continuing with some key aesthetic renovations to boost property value?

What other considerations come to mind?

Some details:

Current house is a 3/2 built in the 1980s on a 0.3 acre lakefront lot. Bought in 2020 for $185k at 3% interest, appraised Nov 2024 at $220k. Currently owe $150k on the 30yr mortgage, and last year got a $10k loan through the City for all new doors & windows (5% interest & 5yr term). 

My spouse and I have a combined income of ~$130k, monthly debt service payments of ~$950. That includes a car payment that should end within the next year and student loans that will be eligible for PSLF forgiveness by 2027. My credit score is ~780 and spouse's is ~700. We're in our early thirties with no kids.

We have ~$15k in a high-yield savings account intended for a honeymoon, but we will put that towards moving expenses and down-payment. Together we could maybe save another $15k over the next year.

If I can hold on to the house, my plan is to rent it out to a close friend or family member at favorable terms, so I don't anticipate taking much or any profit. However, I do have a friend in the vacation rental business who may be willing to manage it for us should we need the extra income.",2024-11-12 01:16:50

personalfinance,1gozuoq,Should I refinance my car loan?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gozuoq/should_i_refinance_my_car_loan/,3,"So I'm trying to weigh the cost/benefits of me refinancing my car payment before I become unemployed in about 2 months. The way I see it, the benefit is that for this uncertain period of unemployment, it will make my month-to-month financial situation a bit more manageable and cause less stress due to lower payments. I've already checked and should be able to lower payments by about $140/month. I have some savings that I will be using to help get by, but lowering my payment (which is about $470/month currently) would help a ton in making me feel more comfortable during the time I'm unemployed. 

The obvious downside is that, over time, I will end up paying more for the car overall. My current interest rate is pretty low, so refinancing would certainly mean extending the terms and paying more overall. Additionally, it's possible that I end up getting a job sooner than I thought and then refinancing will seem like it was especially unnecessary. I really don't know what's realistic in terms of how long it will take me to find a new job. It could be 4 months, it could be 9 months. That said, I suppose I could just pay more than the minimum payment if that occurred moving forward, or even refinance a second time to get terms that are more in line with my income at that point.

All this in mind, what do you guys  suggest? Keeping in mind I'm an extremely anxious person, especially when it comes to money, so the uncertainty of my forthcoming unemployment is definitely weighing on me. That said, I don't really want to fuck over future me too much either and have me paying way more in the long run. But if the options to pay more than the minimum or refinance again are there to mitigate that, then that should factor in.",2024-11-11 18:51:47

personalfinance,1gozi54,Small Second Job Tax Question,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gozi54/small_second_job_tax_question/,6,"Hey all- Last year I picked up a very part time second job in retail, primarily because I enjoyed it and got discounts but def not for the money. Its a seasonal winter gig so the income comes Jan-April and then Nov-December. Reviewing my paystubs from end 23 and beginning 24, I estimate my income at the end of 24 will be maybe $4k from the second job. My primary job makes a bit over $100k. 
Last year I checked the box that I had two jobs on my W4 for my higher paying job as the form suggested. My pay went down a painful amount (there were also some increases in benefit costs and my retirement is set as % based so that probably had a small impact as well). I thought that Federal taxes must have just gone up significantly. When I checked today and compared my federal income tax paid YTD between now and approximately the same time last year, I've already paid over $6k more in Federal taxes with no change in salary or filing status at my higher paying job. 
I was contemplating asking for a raise at my higher paying job and wanted to see what different salaries would do to my take home so I used a salary calculator. When trying to get the calculator to match up with my paystubs I noticed a massive difference coming from checking the two jobs box. If the amount I'm paying in extra federal taxes for having two jobs is more than the income I make, it makes having a second job an expense which seems wrong. 

I would rather just owe a small amount in federal taxes than have the government hold onto all my extra money. I'm perfectly capable of moving money into savings and investments on my own (though I do remember what it was like living paycheck to paycheck and essentially using my refund as a savings account). 

Should I just uncheck that box? Is that considered lying on my taxes?

I’m looking to get some opinions on my situation. I have a pension through the IBEW union. Fully vested. My contractors contributed to it for about 6 years. 

I’ve now moved up into management and am no longer having anything contributed to my pension. I now have a 401k and my Roth. 

I’m wondering if it makes sense to leave the roughly $50k in my pension just sitting there or if it makes sense to roll it over to my Roth or 401k. 

Honestly what I want to do is roll 25k into my Roth and withdrawal the other half to pump my emergency savings, but I don’t if that makes any sense. ",2024-11-11 14:45:15

Since then, I have contributed another 14k of my after tax income. I was not able to deduct anything from those contributions on my tax returns since I guess I make to much for that to be allowed.  
The account is now around 50k, so about 22k in gains.

So, the question is, am I allowed to convert that to a backdoor roth IRA? Would I have to pay taxes on the entire thing? or just the gains (22k)?

Or should I just leave it as is, open a new traditional IRA and a Roth IRA and start doing the backdoor roth stuff going forward?

For context... my AGI is right around 200k, part of that is RSU's, I do expect that to go up 2-4% per year. I am 41 years old.",2024-11-11 18:25:17

Thank you in advance for help. I am a college senior and am currently living in an off campus apartment. I am wondering if there’s a limit for the amount I can withdraw from a 529 to pay for rent. I have been researching online and what I could find was that you could withdraw up to what it would cost to live on campus. Only catch is, my university has 0 student housing for upperclassman. Literally none. There is no option for upperclassman students to live on campus. So what would the 529 deduction limit be? 

If it matters, it is an Oregon 529, but the university I attend is not in Oregon. 

Another piece, next year (I will no longer be here), the school is opening an apartment building to seniors. The price there is 2,000 per month per student. Would that be a safe limit assumption even though that building hasn’t opened yet and isn’t technically an option for me?

I currently get Ch 35 payments since my parent is a disabled vet, but those end in January, so I'm going to be missing $1,536 a month of my income next year. 

I work about 20ish hours a week for $14.75. I'm also a graduate assistant and get 316.56 on the 15th and 30th, but won't get that in January as we don't work over winter break. I get a refund check for school in January that should be about $3,800, and I'm planning on spending $800 of it in January to supplement the missed GA pay, then not touching it unless there's an emergency. 

I'm in a masters program so I can't work full time as I have classes or field placement 4 days a week. I going to try and refinance my car, but i'm wondering if there's anywhere else I can limit my spending. Right now expenses are:

Car: $468.34

Car insurance: $320 ( Its 586.80, but my portion is the $320)

Gas: About $150 a month

Subscriptions: Around $40

Eating out:  150ish (I live at home so I don't pay for grocery)

Miscellaneous: 150 ( Random stuff like medicine, shampoo, Walmart runs, etc)

Parking: $40

Income:

Job: Around $500 every two weeks ( Can be more or less depending on school schedule)

GA: 316.56 on the 15th and 30th

Credit cards: Two that vary as I pay for all my monthly expenses aside from my Car note on them and pay the off each month. 

On my budget sheet I made I put my expected paychecks as $500 since my hours vary as I work at a school, so it depends on when the kids are in school. For February my expenses total to 1585.14 and my income is 1636.56, which leaves me with like $50 a month. I already cut out getting my nails and changed hair  to every 2 months, but I don't know what else to do as I can't work more hours without it affecting my schoolwork.

Last year there were just two plans an HDHP and PPO. The HDHP had slightly lower premiums and slightly higher deductibles, I did the math and the HDHP made the most sense. This year, there is an additional PPO plan that has premiums a few dollars less ($144 annually) than the HDHP with deductibles 2.5 times higher and OOP max 1.84 times higher.   
  
**TL;DR**: New insurance plan has me confused as the HDHP has (slightly) higher premiums and significantly lower deductible and max OOP. 

* Premium:
   * $208.58 bimonthly HDHP
   * $202.50 bimonthly PPO
* Deductible:
   * $2000/$4000 Family Aggregate HDHP
   * $5000/$10000 Family Embedded PPO
* Max OOP
   * $5000/$10000 HDHP
   * $9200/$18400 PPO

Seems to me the math says the PPO with copays will be cheaper if I only ever have doctor visits in a year, but the moment anyone in my family needs a trip to the hospital the HDHP plan would be significantly cheaper. We are a healthy family, so I don't anticipate any trips to the hospital, but that's kind of the point of insurance. Seems like it's a calculation of whether or not the few hundred dollars in extra costs on premiums and paying out of pocket for doctors instead of copays is worth the peace of mind in case a big incident happens + the benefit of adding to an HSA.

personalfinance,1gowo3t,Is it better to pay debt first or invest first,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gowo3t/is_it_better_to_pay_debt_first_or_invest_first/,4,"Hello I'm (22M) now working full time and am trying to work on saving and paying down my debt.

I'm trying to get some advice on how much I should allocate to savings/investing vs paying off my debt. 

Currently I have around 85k in debt from mine and my wifes student loans and our car payments, we don't have any credit card debt. The loan rates are under 5% for around 50k of the debt and then around 7% for the rest. We already have an emergency fund that could last us about 6 months and we bring in around $2,500 extra each month on top of our spending and paying off the minimums on our debt. 

We are on track right now to pay off all our debt in 44 months if that's all we allocate our extra $2500 a month towards. I am trying to decide if that is the best way forward. Or if I should invest half or more each month and pay off the debt slower. What would be a good ratio?

We currently have not been putting any money towards a Roth IRA but I get a fairly good match from my employer for a Roth 401k which I allocate around 4k per year into.

What would you recommend I do?",2024-11-11 16:46:11

In New York, the co-op housing system typically requires 20% down and (here's the kicker), 12-24 months of mortgage and maintenance payments liquid after closing, so my savings need to be much larger than just a standard down payment. With an environment where mortgage rates are still going up despite the Fed cutting rates, and the likely return of inflation next year, I'm questioning whether it makes sense for me to just be sitting on this cash outside of the market.

Here's the current background for my financials:

**Age:** 30, single

**Income:** $118K/yr

**Debt:** $0

**Liquid Savings:** $157K ($126K of which in Marcus CDs at 4.70%, 28K in Ally HYSA at 4.0%)

**Retirement:** $106K in 403B, $7K in Roth IRA (I know I'm slightly behind the 1x by 30 rule, but my income has only increased within the past 2 years or so), I'm saving 18% of gross income into retirement. 

**Housing budget:** To stay within 28% DTI, I think my housing budget caps out at $400K, which won't get me much in New York. With mortgage and maintenance, this is about $2800/monthly payment. I'm not even sure if it's worth being locked in to an co-op unit at my life stage either. 

I know the general rule of thumb is to not put money in the market that you might need for a down payment in  1-2 years, but I'm wondering if I'm better off investing at least the non-down payment part of the savings if buying at current interest rates is just not feasible? I am pretty risk averse and don't want to squander the savings I've cobbled together over the past 8 years or so, but I also realize that I'm also missing out on returns.

I have about 43,000 dollars in student loans. All of them are federal, there are 7 “accounts” ranging from about 1,000 dollars at the lowest to 17,000 at the highest, with an average interest rate of about 4.5%. The 17,000 dollar loan has a 4.625% rate and the 1,000 dollar one is 3.7, for context.

I have been very lucky and have a high paying job where I can work significant overtime, no kids, rent is split, so I can be very aggressive in how I tackle these. My goal is to have them paid off in 3 years.

My question is, should I focus on the low balance accounts first to get those paid off, or should I just make my lump sum payments and have it “auto allocate”. Or is there another strategy you would recommend?

Figures below are made up, but ratio is accurate:

* Monthly Income:  10K

* 401K:  150K (currently doing 5% of paycheck)

* ESPP:  10K (currently doing 5% of paycheck)

* CC Debt:  40K (4 cards), roughly $1500 month minimum payments


To tackle debt, should I:

* Withdrawl $$ from 401K to pay off debt, then increase my monthly 401K / ESPP contributions to 10% once the $1500/mo is freed up?

* Take out loan against 401K to pay off debt,  etc etc

* Pause 401K/ESPP contributions, use extra money (roughly $500) in my paychecks to debt snowball?

I am about to turn 40 and I have never thought deeply about long term financial planning but i am trying to be more responsible now, especially since premiums will go up once I am 40.

so I work as a teacher. There is a free opt-in long term disability insurance policy at my work that would cover me at 60% of my current income (around 90k) if I became disabled. Here is what I don't understand- would this coverage only last as long as I am employed there? I am planning to work there long term, bur if I was employed there and became disabled, they would be able to keep me on as a ""non-salaried employee"" for only two years, at which point they would have to terminate my employment there as well as my benefits. so would the insurance stop at that point?  it says on the thing that the insurance is up to age 65 but I am assuming that is IF I am still an employee? the HR person at my job doesn't really know.  the insurance company is called ""Principal""

 I spoke with an insurance broker and if I keep my employer-given disability insurance the only thing she could find me would pay 20k a year if  i was disabled but would cost a lot so it didn't seem worth it. 

she then told me that if i decline my work's long term disability they can get me a different policy through the Standard which would cost $210/month (2500/year) and would pay 54k yearly if i was disabled. 

i don't understand why i would need to decline the other one to access this insurance. The broker told me ""off the record"" that it was on an honor system and they would have no way of knowing if I declined the one through my job, but I think that IF i was in a situation where I needed the insurance, they would absolutely be able to tell if I was receiving disability insurance through another source. 

I just want whichever option will actually cover me long term if I become disabled. I feel really confused about the options. I also already have a number of low level chronic conditions, (mild crohn's, sleep apnea, sacroilitus, endometriosis) all of which are under control and not disabling me right now but and feel paranoid that i will pay for insurance for years only to be denied anyway because they will try to pin it on my current conditions. 

anyway if you read through this whole thing, thanks. I feel overwhelmed and honestly a bit depressed about this whole thing and I can't what I should do.",2024-11-11 19:30:31

I was t-boned in August and it totalled my 2021 Ford Explorer. I loved my car so much. It was XLT but had some great limited trim qualities to it. It had 8 seats which is great because I'm a youth leader and take my guys on fishing trips and stuff.

It was an awesome transition from my 2005 Toyota Sequoia that I hated to say goodbye to.

My dad was helping me to look for a car and since I was caring for my wife who was in surgery due to the car (she's okay, badly broke her hand), he was going around getting excited about cars. He tells me I should get the 2025 after he checked it out. I cave because he says he'll help me pay for it.

Long story short, my dad isn't helping me pay for it (which is fine! Mostly added that detail to say it's up to me what I do with the car). Now, I'm feeling stuck with this really luxurious car that I just don't need.

To add to it, I have under 2k miles on the car and my powertrain malfunction light (the orange wrench) has come on recently then went away. I've had constant issues with the liftgate not opening or closing or locking when I'm trying to open it. The auto start stop has caused my car to stall once or twice.

Should I just trade the car in for a cheaper/older, and a little bigger,vehicle? Would that be stupid? Should I just hold onto the car since it's all under warranty still?

I'm currently allocating 4% so I don't leave money on the table but I know I should be putting away more (I'm 36 years old). 

My wife has been watching all these tik tok and Instagram videos about investing and is hot-to-trot on Roth IRAs. She has an old account Traditional IRA that has about 30k in it that we haven't contributed to since she stopped working in 2020 as well as a zero balance Roth that's never been touched.

She really wants to put money in the Roth for some reason. I think she has the impression we can ""do more"" with the money in a Roth. I'm not sure what she means and I don't think she really know what that means either.

I said I think it would probably make more sense to increase the 401k contribution rather than put money into the Roth IRA. Also, I'd rather build up our emergency fund before we start messing with other retirement accounts.

Here's what our finances look like per month, in general:

My salary: $5881

Mortgage: $1,720

Car: $470 (2 more years to pay off)

Utilities/insurance: ~$700

Kid's preschool: ~$300

Student loans: $0 (for now, until the SAVE plan shit is figured out, it was ~$150 per month when repayment was active. The balance is ~$52,000)

Our emergency fund has ~$14,000. I'd  like that to be up around 40k, honestly.

My thoughts are, pay off the car asap, then take the car payment and put into emergency fund until we reach 40 or 50k. Once the emergency fund is up where we want it, then we can talk about increasing contributions to the retirement accounts.

But I don't know, we've never been great with money or budgets or investments. We just don't spend on frivolous things and we've been alright.

Does it make any sense to put money in a Roth IRA at any point?

Unfortunately, my condition has worsened, but this is definitely not the right time to inform them that I have this problem (not when I am about to be ""on the bench""). I've been living with and hiding this since I was 19. All of this is to ask, my main concern is that eventually, I'll have to take a job with a much lesser pay that will accommodate my needs. Being so that I still owe a significant amount on my mortgage, I am afraid I wouldn't be able to afford my home anymore. Having a home for my child is a very important thing to me. Would it make sense to dedicate the next 5 years to knock out my mortgage (even though it isn't financially sound as my interest is super low), or should I focus on stashing for retirement the most I can? There is currently 160k in my retirement accounts and 64k in my savings, and I live in a fairly expensive city where the jobs in my industry are. I owe 280k on my mortgage. I am a very anxious person and have a tendency to become afraid and not see the bigger picture. Things like losing my home keep me up at night, so there's also the aspect of peace of mind vs. what is financially sound. Thank you for any insight you may have. ",2024-11-11 14:35:21

Except for my car and student loan payments, I have been putting all of my expenses on my credit cards and pay them in full on the 1st of every month. I try to keep around $1k in my checking account for urgent cash/other needs and everything else left on my checking account goes to my savings. 

I already set up my emergency fund months ago and had been saving to help my parents for a big purchase. That's complete now so I have full control over my money now. So starting this month, I am planning on putting half of my ""leftover"" money into my brokerage account to invest in ETFs such as SCHB or SPY/VOO, and the other half into my HYSA as I had been doing.

I am not planning on making a large purchase in the next few years so this would just be investing/savings without a specific purpose alongside my HYSA which I have and will continue contributing. If I need to take extra money I would first transfer from my savings account before touching my investments.

Is there any reason I shouldn't invest in ETFs in my taxable brokerage account? Due to my line of work I cannot invest in stocks so that's off the table.

Hi everyone 

I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze with 106k miles on it. It’s not a great car to be honest, I’ve had a few problems with it. To list a few things, jve replaced: battery, seprintitne belt, water coolant tank, water hoses, water pump, probably more.

I also have an oil leak in the filter housing and somewhere in or around the exhausts I haven’t fixed that yet because my mechanic said it would be more of an expensive fix

This was 4 months ago btw, and he actually recommended I get rid of it bc they’re known to not be reliable. I also need 4 new tires. So potentially 2-4k plus to fix everything maybe


And I would live a new car, but I also just bought a condo so I’m down on my savings. In total I have about 30k left in savings (Xom stock technically)

I guess I’m just debating between getting a new car, I’m taking like a Mazda CX five or CX 30 with 30-50k miles. I want to try to stay under 20 K because that will leave me about 10 K worth of savings.

On one hand, if I could get 1-2 more years out of the Chevy that would be cool. In theory I could keep driving it with the oil leak bc it still runs ok just smells sometimes 

But I also know that’s a gamble with these cars. So I could potentially fix it but I run the risk of having more issues pop up. The resale value on it now, even if it didn’t have isssuds isn’t much either 

If I get a new used car, that leaves me with not a great amount of savings. Which isn’t terrible but not ideal

I did this mainly with investing in the stock market and the help of personal finance books like her first $100k, Ramit Sethi's I will teach you to be rich, and the simple path to wealth. 

I realize I am intimidated by real estate, mainly because I don't feel like it makes sense to buy anything right now even as an investment and have it be worth it. I also don't know anything about it, hence the intimidation. 

But I want to learn the basics so I can decide for myself, and I am looking for personal finance real estate books that explain the basics and are comparable to those 3 books above that I mentioned. I figured this would be the sub to ask.

The thing I've seen in both of those situations - and a couple of others - is that, aside from scam itself, the judgement of these folks got worse and worse over the years. They were making bad financial choices that they never would've make as younger people.

Most of the info on the web I see about protecting one's self from scammers involves things like ""never give you PIN number out"" and those kinds of things. But that kind of security advice doesn't address protecting money when the person is actually - because their judgement is bad or because they're being lied to, whatever - intent on giving it way. In the situations I'm referring to above, both 85 year olds walked to the bank and wire transferred tens of thousands of dollars.

  
So I'm curious about strategies to protect one's money from one's self. When I used to work in healthcare, I remember the checks used to say something like ""two signatures needed for amounts over $500."" It was a way of assuring that more than one person had made the decision to spend the money. Of course the financial world is far more complicated than that now, but has anyone come up with ways to put a kind of financial firewall in place?",2024-11-10 13:59:54

I owe around 5.5k on it and I haven’t driven it in a year but I’ve still been making the payments and I’ve had to continue paying insurance on it to prevent it from getting towed by my apartment complex. I got a new car shortly after so I don’t really need this car but I’ve been trying to figure out what to do as I can’t really sell it since I owe money on it, but I could get around 2-3k from selling parts I’ve put on the car as I’ve only driven the car for around 4k miles with them on and parts I haven’t even unboxed yet. My thought process is that if I were to take out a loan to pay off the car and get the title so that I could sell it and sell the parts + car to put towards the loan, I’d be able to ditch insurance payments while also being able to put in around half to pay off the loan a bit and also getting into a lower monthly payment since the APR on that auto loan is around 18% since I was a first time buyer with no credit history. My credit is tier 1 so I don’t think I’d have problems in getting a low APR personal loan and I’ve recently started working a higher paying job so I should be able to pay off the loan within the next 4 months if all goes according to plan and at the very least I’ll only have to worry about the loan payment and not insurance or the car getting towed all for a car I haven’t driven in over a year.

Now i live in Poland and i have been making 5000 zl ($1200+-) a month, I need to save money for the future, in my dream I need to buy a house and then I can save more money for unforeseen situations.

Lately i notice how many people from america talk about trust, about the ability to save funds and forget about them until worse times and not worry about their loss or inflation.  
I often wonder how I can start saving and I started by separating large expenses from small ones, I often come to the conclusion that I am in the wrong place. I have the opportunity to earn more while the language barrier and the presence of very deep depression that is getting worse every day from working at the factory simply prevent me from doing this.

I have expenses in the form of an apartment of 2600 zlotys ($645.16) in winter and 2300 zlotys ($570.72) in summer with utilities, at the beginning of December the cost will be raised to 2400 zlotys ($595.53) without utilities so this only worsens the situation. Everything else goes to household items and food, however, recently I discussed this with my girlfriend and we came to the conclusion that it would be more profitable and better for us to cook ourselves just to cut down on food costs, yesterday I skimped on 3 days (6 dishes) for the amount of 100 zlotys ($24), while household items, which would last maybe 2 weeks, cost $12. Previously, we ate takeout food and spent $24 a day as if it had never happened.

I am 31 years old, US citizen, living in Finland (for the next 3 years), and I make approximately 40K a year. 

Currently, my main bank account is Bank of America, where I have around 60K USD and also two credits cards (one normal, one travel card). Obviously, this is a terrible choice so I need a new bank. I also have an account with OP Bank in Finland, with around 10K euro. I also have a Roth IRA and an investment account with Wealthfront (maybe the only good thing I've done with respect to personal finance).

I just read through some parts of the wiki, which was very helpful but left me with even more questions. So, I decided to make a post asking for recommendations on the following two topics:

1. **I want a high-yield savings account.** I looked at [https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/) to see some options. There are a few with rates at or near 5%, but they are from places I've never heard of (e.g. LendingClub, Brio direct, Bask Bank), but this may just be due to my ignorance. Should I just pick whichever has the best rate, even if I've never heard of them? What other factors, apart from the APY, should I take into account when choosing a bank for a savings account?

2. **I want a credit card that is good for use abroad.** I assume I need a credit card. Tbh, I'm not sure *why* I need a credit card, other than some vague notion of improving my credit score. But regardless, I'm willing to accept that it is a necessary item. Since I live abroad, I need a card that can be used abroad without ATM foreign exchange fees. Should the credit card be with the same bank as my savings account? Or should these be optimized separately? Should I use this card for my daily purchases while living abroad, or does it not make sense to use a US card for everything in Europe? Right now, I'm just using my debit card with my Finnish bank, but if I continue to do that, then my US credit card would be essentially useless.

As you can tell from the nature of my questions, I am very ignorant and quite confused. So, I would appreciate answers that explain basic concepts. Thank you.",2024-11-11 03:32:07

personalfinance,1goe7uj,Pay lump towards auto finance principle or keep it invested? ,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1goe7uj/pay_lump_towards_auto_finance_principle_or_keep/,4,"Hey all, 

I'm about to finance a new car purchase of $55k at 5.6%. 

Where I am at. I can only do a max down payment of 40% or about 22k. With 22k down and 36 months, im looking at a monthly payment of 1k.

I do have an extra 10k that I can potentially use to pay down towards the principle as soon as the financing starts. There will, however, be about a 2% penalty on that extra payment. 

I can manage the 1k monthly payment in my budget, so I could potentially do a 24 month loan instead, and that extra payment towards the principle at the start would bring down my monthly payment back to the 1k mark. By doing this 24 month method, I should be able to save about 1.5k in interest over the course of the loan.

Alternatively, I can keep that extra 10k invested in the sp500 and do the 36 month loan. At around the 2 year mark, I would just pay off the rest of the loan if the market is in my favor. I know theres no guarentee, but my crystal ball tells me that the market can beat the 15% or so I would need over the course of 2 years from now, to put me ahead of my proposed 24 month method above. If the market is down in 2 years, Id just continue making payments until the end of the loan as usual and keep the money invested in the market for the long haul.

I guess theres also the option of doing the 36 months, pay the extra towards the principle, then just keep the loan payments down to about 700 for the 36 months. The extra 300 would just be thrown into retirement accounts. 

What would the right move here be? Just pay down the extra towards the principle and finish out the loan in 24 months with almost certainty, or keep that extra invested in hopes that it will beat the loan, but with the possibilty of keeping that loan for 36 months if the market doesnt go in my favor? The idea of having payments looming over my head for just 24 months is definitely more appealing than 36, thmonthi think 36 months isnt all too long in the grand scheme of things either. I do plan to keep this car for at least 10-15 years. Additionally, I have no other debts or mortgages, and this would really be the first time im on any sort of payment plan other than rent. 

What would you all do? ",2024-11-10 23:31:34

I’ve put out that I babysit, I draw for commissions, I am a photographer, I’ll even tutor in writing, but all these places I’ve applied are so damn slow at letting me get started. 

I have 20 days to figure out how to make $1200 and I’m basically alone. I can’t ask my mom to co-sign for me anymore, as she did so on my student loans. 

My credit score is 660, and my line has been open for well over a year, but my credit score is getting tanked daily by my deferred student loans. The only credit card I have (Discover) has a $500 limit. I keep seeing people say it’s a horrible idea to try and get a loan with fair credit only, but I’m out of options.

Credit karma says I have good odds with so-and-so bank, but when I apply they always, ALWAYS deny. I’ve applied for multiple cards not even for the money but just to build my credit and they still deny. The amount I need isn’t much. Even just $600 would hold me over until I can find stable work. But no lender will ever give that little knowing it’s zero returns. 

I’ve tried unemployment and assistance through my college campus but no dice. Please, someone; I will heed any advice. I can’t ask anyone around me to lend me that kind of money, I’m alone at the mercy of employers near me. 

also just wanna state that I lost my last job due to mental health reasons.

I have several credit cards...it's the only way to survive on SSI (630/mo) w monstrous med expenses that the govt doesn't give 2 f\*cks about, so a few have a different amount on it I carry over. For example, my gas card I can pay off in full every mo. 2 other cards I may be able to pay, say 150 each and leave 1000 or so on one and 900 or so on the other.  
So I have no idea what my ""monthly debt"" means. I always have debt every month b/c I always carry a balance. There's zero way out of that.

1. Get a 38K loan from my credit union, pay the dealership the total price, then pay the CU a 10K “down payment” under the guise of an initial loan payment toward principal?

I’m 29 years old and finally landed my first full time job as a software engineer a couple months ago. My base salary is $145k per year with $50k in stocks and a 15 percent bonus (around $20k per year). Usually people at my company get promotion and a raise of about $50k every 2 or 3 years. 

Currently I’m maxing out my 401k and purchasing stock through our stock matching program. My plan is to stash away money into an hysa until I reach about $20k and then split my investments into 80 percent SPY and 20 percent bonds. I’m able to save around $4000 per month not including the 401k, $50k in stocks, or bonus. 

My plan eventually is to purchase a duplex and rent out the other unit. I’m wondering if this sounds like a solid investing/saving strategy or if anyone would have any suggestions or advice?

I am seeking financial advices here because I’ve never truly planned my finances since I graduated. At the end of every month it feels like I’ve made little progress towards saving and it gives me existential crisis about the whole purpose of my life. 

A little bit of my background: In the past 2 years the Software Engineering job market went to shit. I got laid off from my previous job and had to take a low level role in a really small local company (toxic). I am looking for jobs everyday but I am a few thousand applications deep with no job offer. Thus, I am practically stuck at my current job. Part of the reasons that the job search was so hard for me is because I’m not a US citizen, and the majority of companies right now would much more prefer having candidates that have US citizenship (I completely understand and respect this). Also I am trying to transition to another more advanced job title, which requires more experience that I don’t have. 

This whole “not being able to save money” ordeal is giving me the big sad. I try to manage it but I will definitely reach out to therapy when it becomes too severe. I hope for a better future but it is what it is. Just like an old proverb in my home country says: “Do what a man can do, but accept the fate of destiny”

TLDR: Can someone give me some advices on how to unfuck my finances. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry ingles is not my first language. 

Details: 
M29 single IT support engineer

Debt: 
$30k car loan (2020 Mazda CX5), monthly payment $640, APR 9.47%, remaining amount $24k, with 45 months left

Spending:
rent $2k/month (including utilities)
car loan payment $640/month
insurance $150/month
food & groceries $700/month 
gas $60/month (don’t really drive a lot)
subscriptions $300/month (GPT, Netflix, ATT, LinkedIn premium, PlayStation, Preply)
other $500 from various random things
Total spending around $4.4k/month

savings: $60k in a regular saving account
Income: $100k HCOL pretax, 5.7k/ month after tax

Q1: What do you think I can do better in my finances? What should I cut, what can be replaced?

Q2: Should I pay off the car loan immediately? I have the cash but not sure if it impacts credit score. 

Q2.1: My Visa is not permanent, although I have 2 years left at the minimum. Because Trump became the new president of the US (respect), it could be much more likely that I won’t be able to extend my Visa again. In that case I would need to “go back to where I came from”, probably need to sell the car at that point. If this is taken into consideration, do you still recommend me paying off the car early? 

Q3: Should I put all my savings into HYSA? I know it’s not much (it’s honest work), but is there a better place to put it? Should I consider investing it (I know next to nothing about investing) What do you think my small portfolio should look like?

Q4: Anything else you feel like mentioning please thanks.

I’m 19 and currently studying a tech-related degree in a pretty good uni. I’ll be starting my first job next year, and I recently dipped my toes into the stock market – about two months ago, actually. So far, I’m up by about 15%, but it feels like I just got lucky rather than making informed decisions. I’d love some advice on how to truly learn the ropes and invest in a way that’s sustainable and well-informed.

Here are a few questions I have:

1. **What should I be looking for when researching stocks?** Should my focus be more on the performance of the stock itself or on the fundamentals of the company? And in either case, what are the key indicators I should watch?
2. **Where can I find reliable information and resources?** Are there specific books, websites, YouTubers, podcasts, or other sources you’d recommend? How do I sort the useful info from the “noise” or bad advice? And, is there a way to learn to anticipate market trends? If so - how to learn to do that?
3. **What annual growth should I aim for?** I know it’s a broad question, and obviously, the higher, the better. But realistically, what percentage growth would indicate that I’m doing reasonably well? Or, what range should I consider a good vs. a poor result?
4. **Any general tips or tricks for a beginner?** Anything you wish you knew when you first started or that helped you along the way?

Just to clarify, I’m not looking for quick ways to get rich or any “invest here for an immediate return” type of advice. I want to grow my account over the long term and really wish to understand how to invest wisely – so any insights on learning to do that would be amazing. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-10 22:36:41

It sounds like you guys aren't recording my information. She goes no you're wrong, all calls are recorded. It's like yeah I get that but you're saying you guys didn't Record aka write down any of the info I gave in the hour long conversation with the other agent.

I explain an IDR is an income driven repayment plan. She said oh, well let me get some info from you, I give her my info about my expenses and my income. She said I don't make enough to qualify for reduced payments. Extremely counter-intuitive logic. Then she goes back and forth saying it's your responsibility to get this done but what she wanted done had to be done by someone else. It was a deferment form that the school would have to upload but then she kept inferring it was my job to do it even though it has to be done by the school and my only question was where to send it when it's completed. So I don't make enough to qualify for reduced payments and she wants to make sure I complete a form that someone else has to complete. Then I went to ask about the default because she as implying my account would be put into default by the end of the month if I don't pay $300 because that's my monthly payment amount. And before I could ask the question she blurted out some script saying thanks for choosing Sallie Mae and hung up on me mid sentence. I just left that conversation pissed off. Then she had the nerve to say I'm gonna let Miriam know how this call went. As if to say that as a punitive gossip. She kept demanding I pay $300 when I kept telling her I only have $20 in my bank account. The confusing part was when she was getting my info she's asking what're you in school for I say cybersecurity she goes ""thats goooooood...."" She said whats your job title I said ""supervisor"" she said ""that's goooooooddddd..."" At the end she goes nope you don't qualify for anything.

Please take it easy on me lol. I have zero finance knowledge and have been trying to learn more.

My father created a Vanguard account for me a few years ago to deposit some money into from an inheritance rather than writing me a check. It's now just an empty account (some costly life circumstances happened, unfortunately, causing me to withdraw the money). I'd love to start using the account again.

When I log into Vanguard it says that it's a Brokerage account and underneath it says, ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund)"" When I click on more info it says,

""Your settlement fund is the holding inside your brokerage account that’s used to pay for investments (e.g., mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, and bonds) and receive proceeds from investment sales and other transactions.

You may change your settlement fund by clicking to the left, under “More account information” or navigate to “Profile and Account Settings” and select “Banking.”

When I click on ""Vanguard Federal Money Markey Fund"" it says VMFXX.

I have absolutely no clue what any of this means lol. From my very rudimentary knowledge of money market funds, VMFXX is supposed to be relatively low risk? However, when there was money in the account, it would often fluctuate and I would lose money and sometimes gain money (more losses than gains, often).  Sometime's the loss would be as much as $1,800. Do money market funds generally have that big of hits??

Essentially, I'm clueless with all of this. Should I just close this account and start fresh with something else? My goal is to have my money grow and not just be sitting in a savings account. Should I invest in an index fund? Money Market?

Any help is appreciated, I know this probably seems very straight forward but I am lost lol.

Originally I planned to choose my employers option that allows for an HSA. As an added bonus, they will contribute $850 to the account annually for completing very simple health goals (e.g. go to the doc, do an online activity, complete a preventative screening, etc). I planned to contribute the maximum amount annually.

However, this past year I was diagnosed with a lifelong autoimmune disease. It's nothing too terrible as far as lifelong diseases go, but it's enough to warrant 2 medications I will likely be on forever. One is a very expensive (~$7000/mo without insurance) name brand specialty medication. I will also need to be going for outpatient procedures at least every other year as well as seeing a specialist 2-4 times per year. And while I'm not planning to have any more issues, this condition does make me higher risk for some more complications down the road.

I inputted my information into an AI tool provided by HR for choosing a plan, and it strongly suggests for me to do the Copay option. Per the calculations I will pay ~$1000/yr less using the copay option rather than the HSA option (This number does include the $850 bonus, so really I would pay about $1800/yr more for the HSA.) The ""worst case scenario"", while I could afford both options, is cheaper with the copay option as well by around $1100.

I make a good living and my plan was always to pay for everything out of pocket and leave the HSA as just an additional tool for retirement. However I'm not sure it's worth it to pay so much extra just to have an HSA? Hoping someone could provide some insight. ",2024-11-10 01:43:00

Having said that, I'm slowly being forced into making an investment decision as interest rates begin to drop.  I have saved $125K at this point, and plan to set \~$20K in an emergency fund while investing the rest.  I have no debt and I'm taking advantage of my employer's 401K option (100% match on 6%; nothing more).  After quite some reading, I'm thinking of investing in this portfolio:

70/15/15 in FXAIX/FSKAX/QQQ

How does this sound?  What would you change and why?  I feel good about a S&P500 core with a total market fund and 3rd fund as opposed to portfolio that incorporates an international index fund.

I chose FXAIX over VOO, SPY and IVV because it has the lowest expense ratio and while I understand the tax advantages of an ETF like IVV and VOO, the difference seemed negligible - especially when considering FXAIX has outperformed VOO.

I chose FSKAX over FZROX, VTI and VTSAX for similar reasons.  FZROX's zero expense ratio was enticing however, being locked in doesn't quite sit right with me even though I don't plan in switching brokerage accounts - but you never know.

The third fund is a wild card and I'm still not sure what to select.  So far, QQQ, QQQM and SCHD are contenders but I'd like to hear feedback and/or other options.

As far as specific goals?  Growth with little-to-moderate risk.  I'd also like to hear feedback on how to begin investing.  I'm leery of going all in, in one lump sum - or even DCA - not just because the stock market is at a relative high but also because the federal reserve has begun their pivot.  Would love your input!

Looking at homes in this price range, not certain if this is a good range for my financial makeup:

Planning on putting 20% down. So with those ranges I would be putting 80k -  90k down.

My main concern is if I should be paying off all of my student loans with the extra in my HYSA or if the rates are so low that I should hold onto the cash or put down more on the home being that the mortgage rate would be higher than the student loans. Also is my home purchase in the correct range for my situation? Not sure how I should approach this situation. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,1goeu07,Recently moved father into assisted living facility and need help understanding his finances/options (long-term care insurance denied),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1goeu07/recently_moved_father_into_assisted_living/,9,"I recently moved my father into an assisted living facility, and I need some help understanding his financial situation because 1) this was an accelerated process due to his health and I am still figuring everything out, and 2) he is likely not going to receive his long-term care insurance—at least not for some time and not without an appeal process. 

My father has given me POA, and I have been added to his checking account. I do not have access to his IRA and what seems to be labelled a TOD account, which I assume means transfer on death. I’m confused about what money is “his” in these accounts and generally how these accounts work. Now that we have moved to this new stage in his life, I’d like to make sure he has enough money to live on and afford his rent, and I’d also like to understand what money is available to him to withdraw in either the case of emergency or in a situation where his checking account appears in danger of running low. 

The IRA currently has around $30,000 in “Cash and sweep balances,” and a little under $220,000 in “annuities and insurance,” which seems to be a life insurance policy. It is an Indexed Annuity with around half of its amount in S&P 500 funds, and the other half is in JPMorgan ETF Efficient 5 Point. The surrender value is listed at about $185,000. Am I correct in my understanding that this is where his monthly income comes from, and that he would receive $185,000 if he cashed out of this annuity? Is this an amount of money that can be withdrawn from in the case of emergency, or would the entire policy need to be liquidated? Or, is he stuck in this annuity forever? 

I also only half understand the concept of the RMD for the IRA. I get the idea and how it is calculated, but I am not quite sure where this money is withdrawn from--is it from the Cash and Sweep balance, or the annuity value? Is this something I need to prepare for each year, or can this be automatically withdrawn from his account? 

The TOD account is similarly valued at around $250,000, but all of it is in “annuities/insurance.” This time, there’s around $40,000 in what seems to be another Life Insurance policy, labeled as a Variable Annuity, but it mentions nothing about monthly payout, and I definitely haven’t seen him receiving any money from this in his checking, so that was a little worrisome to me. Then, there is also around $200,000 in another life insurance policy. It is labelled as an Indexed Annuity with a surrender value of $177,000. Similarly, I haven’t been able to track the payout from this either, although yesterday was my first time looking through these statements, so I’m still figuring a lot of this out.

Thank you in advance for any help understanding all of this. With the potential delay or prolonged appeal process for long-term care insurance, I find myself in a position where I want to understand all of his financial options. My worry is that the majority of my father's money appears to be in these annuities, and I just don't understand what of this money is ""his"" and how it can be accessed if needed. 

Also, if anyone is going through or has gone through a similar situation, I am 100% open to any advice regarding managing a parent's finances when they are in this stage of life. I want my father to have many happy, stable years ahead of him, but, as I'm sure some of you know, this situation often feels overwhelming. ",2024-11-11 00:00:56
personalfinance,1goeclj,Can I afford to take a break or downsize my work? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1goeclj/can_i_afford_to_take_a_break_or_downsize_my_work/,0,"Throwaway Account

Hi everyone, 

I’ve been a long time reader and want to first thank you all for the advice and knowledge I’ve gained ever since following this sub. I’d really appreciate any feedback on my progress and advice y’all have to offer.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I could really use your help and wanted to give you as much information as possible.

I grew up in a small rural town in the Midwest. After college I moved to Austin for better work options and the weather. I enjoy Austin and have made some great friends here, but all of my family is back in my home state. The past 10 years or so I’ve really struggled with wanting to move closer to family.

My dad passed away about 8 years ago. My mom is still living and in good health, but after a recent visit I noticed she is starting to slow down. Not as confident driving, using hand rails more often, taking stairs one at a time, etc. She turns 80 next year. She and I are very close and I’ve long thought of retiring early and moving closer to her and the rest of my family, but now I’m contemplating pulling the plug and just moving back next year. I’m fortunate to have a well paying job, and doubt I’ll make this much money should I move back. I’m concerned that if I do not make a bold move and go, I’ll never return or I’ll return when mom is really in need of assistance or falls ill. I know I would regret waiting too long. In my mind Austin will always be here, but sadly my mom won’t.

I’ve always been somewhat of a saver, but didn’t get really serious about it until about 13 years ago when I read about the FIRE movement. I would love an early retirement. I’ve had good paying jobs, but didn’t cross the 6 figure income mark until 2015/2016. I’m now making more money than I ever have, which makes it even more difficult to walk away from. At minimum I’m trying to stay at my current job until mid February when I will get my next chunk of RSU’s. The amount I get in February is the largest of the tranches. Approx $30-$40k after taxes depending on stock price. I honestly am not sure if I can hold out that long though.

Long term I’ve always planned on moving home. I’m not so much worried about the adjustment in lifestyle/income as I am sabotaging retirement. If I pulled the plug without having a job lined up I could stay with my mom and I am not too proud to take lower paying jobs until something more permanent that I enjoy comes around.

Another thing that is pushing me is my current job. I’m pretty miserable in my current role and I just can’t see myself in the role much longer. At the same time I’m so burned out I don’t know what else to do. Every job description sounds like what I’m trying to escape. I’d be willing to look for another job here, but think that would lock me into Austin for at least another couple of years and I’d still be away from my family. I wouldn’t be against it, but really feel like I need to just take a break and clear my head. I admit I’m not one who takes great care of my mental health, and I’m probably paying the price for that now.

**TLDR:** I have a good paying job in tech (finance/operations side) but am contemplating leaving to move closer to family. My current job is very demanding, draining and I have thought about scaling back. The work/life balance is really poor and the environment is borderline toxic. I’m burned out and to the point where I dread going to work and am thinking I might like to change fields all together. I just don’t have the passion for business anymore. I have a few great friends here, but we don’t get together all that often as they moved to the burbs and have families. This move would be from Austin to the midwest. I don’t want to derail retirement and plan to still contribute as much as I can afford. Would love to retire early (mid/late 50s) if possible. I need to work at least 5 more years so that I have 35 years of employment to count for Social Security. I realize I will likely need to work more than 5 years in order to retire comfortably. I’ve also considered just taking some time off. Moving in with my mom (to minimize costs although I would be chipping in as much as I can afford and would likely get a part time job or something to keep a stream of income), get over this burnout, and finding something I like better even if it means going back to school.  I need some kind of change though as I feel pretty unhappy, don’t want to continue the career path that I’m on (boss works 14 hour days 6 days a week), and I miss my family a lot. I enjoy Austin, but it’s become very crowded and expensive. I’ve long dreamed about eventually living somewhere with a lower cost of living, I grew up in a rural area. My previous job was remote and I was able to spend my summers with my family. Unfortunately I was impacted by a corporate downsizing, fortunately I was scooped up by my current employer after a couple of months of being unemployed. Current job was supposed to be that I would go to the office 1 day a month. Company policy changed about 2 months after I was hired. Now I really only get to see my family at Christmas, and I hate that. In the past few weeks I’ve had what I believe to be anxiety or panic attacks that are likely caused by my current mental state, work, and struggling with this decision. I took a week off of work 2 weeks ago to see my family and like every time I visit I didn’t want to leave. Like crying didn’t want to leave. As soon as I went back to work, all of the stress and anxiety came back as if I hadn’t taken any time off. 

I yearn for a decent simple life closer to family. Careerwise I’m not really passionate about anything anymore. I don’t need to be rich, just need to be able to keep the lights on and save for retirement.

**Questions:**

Am I crazy for considering this? 

How bad would the impact to my retirement be? (Thinking more about long term retirement. I don’t mind working longer if needed and I enjoy the work. Ability to retire early would just be a bonus.)

What other things should I consider? 

Overall how’s my progress? Somedays I think I’ve done well, other days I feel behind.

I realize it’s my decision, but what would you do in my situation?

How should I better prepare for being jobless if that happens? Should I start putting more money in cash and less in the Mega Back Door Roth 401k?

Is this just a mid-life crisis?

Any other advice is appreciated. 

**Stats:**

45 year old male

Single, never married, no children, no pets (dog passed earlier this year)

Bachelors and Masters degree in business

Annual gross salary: $150,000.00

Annual gross bonus: $15,000 but could be up to $25,000 depending on company performance. Paid in February

RSUs Unvested: $206,094.00 (4 year vesting schedule, most in January, some in August)

ESPP - Invest 15%. Receive the stocks every 6 months with a 15% discount based on the average price over the 6 month period. Pays out in May and November.

Counting ESPP, bonus, and RSU grants I project to gross about $223k this year.

**Annual Savings:**

ESPP: Put in full 15%. Holding for LTCG then will sell and reinvest.

RSUs: Holding for now (inside trader list) but will eventually sell and reinvest.

Traditional 401k: $23,000 (max) not including 50% of first 6% company match

Mega Back Door Roth 401k: $14,000 (I put in as much as I can afford)

IRA - Typically max out, but will likely stop and instead put the full amount I can contribute into the Mega Back Door Roth 401k.

HSA - max (company contributes $600)

I target to save at least 40% of total income for retirement. (I count RSU and ESPP holdings as savings)

**Cash and equivalents:**

Capital One HYSA/Checking - $57,000 (I like to keep about 1 year of expenses in cash. This I consider my emergency fund but will use some for purchases if needed as long as the balance doesn’t go below $35-$40k)

CD - 5% - $200,000.00 matures next year. (I debated listing this. This was a gift from my mom  for a house. My parents helped my brother and his wife with their home over the years and she wants everything to be equal so she gifted this to me a few months ago. I have no plans to buy a house now, we agreed to put it into a 1 year 5% CD with her has the primary holder and I as the secondary. She insisted that she pay the taxes until I decide what I want to do with it. So far I exclude this from my retirement calc since this was unplanned. I’m incredibly fortunate, grateful, and still a bit shocked. Decided to lock it up for a year so I can think about the best use for this money)

**Investments:**

**Taxable: ($227,908.00)**

Brokerage 1: 

$7,229.00 (some individual stocks from when I first started investing I don’t want to sell)

Brokerage 2: 

$37,475.57 (about half individual stocks and half Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund)

Company Stock: $77,821.00 - Vested RSUs and ESPP

Old Company Stock 1: $3,978.00 - Vested

Old Company Stock 2: $34,532.00 - Vested (in the red, but believe it will come back. Willing to see for tax loss harvesting/offsetting income if needed.)

Brokerage 3: 

3 Fund Portfolio: $66,872.00 

**Roth Accounts: ($251,822.00)**

Fidelity Roth IRA: $127,299.00 

Fidelity Roth 401K: $26,233.00 (Current company)

Old Employer Roth 401k: $98,289.00

**Traditional Accounts: ($305,224.00)**

Fidelity IRA: $146,633.00

Fidelity 401K: $68,283.00 (Current company)

Old Employer 401K: $90,306.00

**HSA: ($34,948.95)**

Fidelity: $34,948.95 (60/20/20 US/International/Bond index funds)

Grand Total of investments: $821,102.00

**Total Net Worth** excluding Housing CD: $875,750.00

**Assets:**

2012 Ford Fusion - 65k miles - fully paid off - runs great but has had some minor issues recently. Want to keep for as long as I can.

**Debt: $3,400**

Normal monthly expenses on credit cards that are paid off each month. It's a bit higher this month due to a recent trip back home.

**Health:**

Good overall health. I take high blood pressure meds, and wear contact lenses. I currently have over a year's supply of lenses on hand. I think with a less stressful job I could get off the meds. I love working out, but have no time/energy now to develop a good routine. Diet would also likely be better since I'm a stress eater.

**Notes:**

\*Target investment mix is 60/20/20 although current allocation has drifted more to 65/20/15. I rebalance only if there is a 10% deviation from the target mix. I try to rebalance with new money. I do not take individual brokerages in account except for the 3 fund portfolio when determining the need to rebalance. I realize I probably should. I avoid fixed income investments in Roth accounts as best I can as I want that money to have the highest growth potential.

\*I front-load my 401k. I invest 50%+ of my paycheck into the traditional 401k until I only need to put enough in to get the full company match (they match 50% of my 6% contribution) for the rest of the year and still max out. Then I set my contribution to 6% and increase the contributions to the Mega Back Door Roth 401k. After front-loading my take home is around $2500 every 2 weeks. I sometimes get a small monetary gift from my mom at Christmas in lieu of presents. If needed I sell RSU/ESPP shares to subsidize living expenses while front loading, but I rarely need to do that.

\*Will eventually roll over old employer 401k into existing Roth/Traditional IRA.

\*Cash position used to be higher, but my dog got sick. It cost approximately $20k for his treatments/surgeries. I saved a separate fund for him and any potential health issues since I elected not to get pet insurance. I’m very happy I was able to provide him what he needed and not be too stressed about the money. I’m slowly rebuilding that to try and get back to around $60k-$65k, but really trying to focus on maximizing investments especially now that I have access to a Mega Back Door Roth 401K.

\*Planning on using the HSA for insurance/healthcare costs in retirement.

\*If I move my cost of living would likely decrease, but budgeting for it to be around the same just to be safe. Not sure what my salary in any new position would look like. 

\*According to Personal Capital, expenses have averaged around $75,000 a year the past 6 years. This is bit high as some of the expenses were work related or things I’d buy for my friends/family where I was reimbursed. When I used to track expenses closely my expenses were about $60,000 - $65,000 a year. My spending habits have not changed much from then. Rent is around $2400 a month and included in that total. I realize that rent is a lot relative to my take home pay, but I love my apartment and have no debt so I’m ok with it for now. I do eat out too much now, but really enjoy cooking and know I could (and have) live on less.

My credit score is 820. My wife’s credit score is 730. Her score is still being impacted from 3 late payment charges from June-August 2019 on a credit card. Besides that she has no other negative marks. 

When applying for a mortgage, should it just be me on the application or will having both of is be better? Not sure if this information is needed, but our gross yearly income is $113k & $140k.

Currently living with my parents as the move for my job was quick. I hate the idea of continuing to rent like I did in school as you’re not putting money towards something. I’m looking into buying a home and was just looking for some advice.

In this market, is it realistic to only spend 30% on a mortgage payment?

Should I be looking at a conventional, WHEDA, or FHA loan? (In WI)

Is it worth it in the long run to do a down payment assistance program?

Do I really need a realtor and if so, how much do they cost? Would they be able to negotiate on a price enough that is definitely worth getting one?

What are some things I should ask if I go to open houses?

Should I absolutely make sure I can pay 20% down?

Should I wait to see if mortgage loans go down? (I could only wait a few months as I can’t stay with my parents for long)

Those are the kinds of questions I’ve been googling but I would really appreciate some added advice, even if it’s just your personal experience and not answering questions directly! ",2024-11-11 04:47:29

I started my own Roth IRA a few years ago & manage it myself which has been doing very well so far; I aim to start maxing it out starting this year but I just don't feel like it's enough -- I don't want to spend another 35+ years not having a work-life balance & working 10-12hr workdays 5-6 days/week.

According to what I've been reading online: the recommended amount of one's 401k yearly contribution should be 15% of their annual income (which I am a bit over). Does anyone else in my age range feel like I do? Where do you weigh in on this? Are you utilizing anything other financial strategies to help you retire on time?

I am two years post graduation and one and a half years into my career as a teacher. We recently signed a new contract which includes 100% reimbursement for graduate degrees up to a certain amount per year. I will need to start my grad work soon (needed for my state’s teaching requirements) and I want to take advantage of this reimbursement. 

My current situation: I am a first generation college student, and I have a little less than $50K in private loans. This is at about 12% interest, and is roughly $700/month. I have tried to refinance, but I have been denied trying to do so by myself. I will be trying to refinance soon with my original co-signer. 

My question: Should I start my grad school and take out federal student loans to cover my studies and use the tuition reimbursement to pay down/off my private loans? The interest rates will be much lower than my private loans. I will (most likely) be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) after working in my field for ten years, which would erase all of my federal loans. My alternate is to use the reimbursement to just pay off the grad school work and avoid further loans.

I have been told someone opened a joint account and then transferred money to other accounts.

1. How can someone has found out, my account numbers? (Now I know Fidelity was hacked in August, but Fidelity never mentioned me when I called, where its transparency?)

2. If someone opens a joint account, How come the primary account holder never gets notified that a joint account has been opened? How come it never showed up on my account side? I did not get a text any email etc.. None, zilch, nada

3. How can someone transfer money into another account without me getting a text?  Where were the security parameters?

When I make bank-to-bank transfers with any other banking system, even $500 in a local bank transfer and both accounts are mine, it asks me random security questions, like, what was my first car, what are my previous addresses, etc, and randomly verifies the information. In this instance, someone transferred hefty money to a different account, and there were no safety parameters in place, why?

4. Fidelity, such a big company, has no AI software that flags the money transfer, if I spend $100 abroad on my credit card, it gets blocked due to unusual transactions. I have had an account for 30 years and never withdrawn and no bell rang? How it is possible?

5. Fidelity customer service performed way below average in this extraordinary situation, No one knows, what is going on. There was no courtesy letter to tell customers that we are sorry that it happened, we are investigating, and this is our timeline to look into the matter, and you will hear from us, in such time frame, nop, none Zilch.

Hi everyone, 

I’ve been a long time reader and want to first thank you all for the advice and knowledge I’ve gained ever since following this sub. I’d really appreciate any feedback on my progress and advice y’all have to offer.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I could really use your help and wanted to give you as much information as possible.

I grew up in a small rural town in the Midwest. After college I moved to Austin for better work options and the weather. I enjoy Austin and have made some great friends here, but all of my family is back in my home state. The past 10 years or so I’ve really struggled with wanting to move closer to family.

My dad passed away about 8 years ago. My mom is still living and in good health, but after a recent visit I noticed she is starting to slow down. Not as confident driving, using hand rails more often, taking stairs one at a time, etc. She turns 80 next year. She and I are very close and I’ve long thought of retiring early and moving closer to her and the rest of my family, but now I’m contemplating pulling the plug and just moving back next year. I’m fortunate to have a well paying job, and doubt I’ll make this much money should I move back. I’m concerned that if I do not make a bold move and go, I’ll never return or I’ll return when mom is really in need of assistance or falls ill. I know I would regret waiting too long. In my mind Austin will always be here, but sadly my mom won’t.

I’ve always been somewhat of a saver, but didn’t get really serious about it until about 13 years ago when I read about the FIRE movement. I would love an early retirement. I’ve had good paying jobs, but didn’t cross the 6 figure income mark until 2015/2016. I’m now making more money than I ever have, which makes it even more difficult to walk away from. At minimum I’m trying to stay at my current job until mid February when I will get my next chunk of RSU’s. The amount I get in February is the largest of the tranches. Approx $30-$40k after taxes depending on stock price. I honestly am not sure if I can hold out that long though.

Long term I’ve always planned on moving home. I’m not so much worried about the adjustment in lifestyle/income as I am sabotaging retirement. If I pulled the plug without having a job lined up I could stay with my mom and I am not too proud to take lower paying jobs until something more permanent that I enjoy comes around.

Another thing that is pushing me is my current job. I’m pretty miserable in my current role and I just can’t see myself in the role much longer. At the same time I’m so burned out I don’t know what else to do. Every job description sounds like what I’m trying to escape. I’d be willing to look for another job here, but think that would lock me into Austin for at least another couple of years and I’d still be away from my family. I wouldn’t be against it, but really feel like I need to just take a break and clear my head. I admit I’m not one who takes great care of my mental health, and I’m probably paying the price for that now.



**TLDR:** I have a good paying job in tech (finance/operations side) but am contemplating leaving to move closer to family. My current job is very demanding, draining and I have thought about scaling back. The work/life balance is really poor and the environment is borderline toxic. I’m burned out and to the point where I dread going to work and am thinking I might like to change fields all together. I just don’t have the passion for business anymore. I have a few great friends here, but we don’t get together all that often as they moved to the burbs and have families. This move would be from Austin to the midwest. I don’t want to derail retirement and plan to still contribute as much as I can afford. Would love to retire early (mid/late 50s) if possible. I need to work at least 5 more years so that I have 35 years of employment to count for Social Security. I realize I will likely need to work more than 5 years in order to retire comfortably. I’ve also considered just taking some time off. Moving in with my mom (to minimize costs although I would be chipping in as much as I can afford and would likely get a part time job or something to keep a stream of income), get over this burnout, and finding something I like better even if it means going back to school.  I need some kind of change though as I feel pretty unhappy, don’t want to continue the career path that I’m on (boss works 14 hour days 6 days a week), and I miss my family a lot. I enjoy Austin, but it’s become very crowded and expensive. I’ve long dreamed about eventually living somewhere with a lower cost of living, I grew up in a rural area. My previous job was remote and I was able to spend my summers with my family. Unfortunately I was impacted by a corporate downsizing, fortunately I was scooped up by my current employer after a couple of months of being unemployed. Current job was supposed to be that I would go to the office 1 day a month. Company policy changed about 2 months after I was hired. Now I really only get to see my family at Christmas, and I hate that. In the past few weeks I’ve had what I believe to be anxiety or panic attacks that are likely caused by my current mental state, work, and struggling with this decision. I took a week off of work 2 weeks ago to see my family and like every time I visit I didn’t want to leave. Like crying didn’t want to leave. As soon as I went back to work, all of the stress and anxiety came back as if I hadn’t taken any time off. 

I yearn for a decent simple life closer to family. Careerwise I’m not really passionate about anything anymore. I don’t need to be rich, just need to be able to keep the lights on and save for retirement.



**Questions:**

Am I crazy for considering this? 

How bad would the impact to my retirement be? (Thinking more about long term retirement. I don’t mind working longer if needed and I enjoy the work. Ability to retire early would just be a bonus.)

What other things should I consider? 

Overall how’s my progress? Somedays I think I’ve done well, other days I feel behind.

I realize it’s my decision, but what would you do in my situation?

How should I better prepare for being jobless if that happens? Should I start putting more money in cash and less in the Mega Back Door Roth 401k?

Is this just a mid-life crisis?

Any other advice is appreciated. 



**Stats:**

45 year old male

Single, never married, no children, no pets (dog passed earlier this year)

Bachelors and Masters degree in business

Annual gross salary: $150,000.00

Annual gross bonus: $15,000 but could be up to $25,000 depending on company performance. Paid in February

RSUs Unvested: $206,094.00 (4 year vesting schedule, most in January, some in August)

ESPP - Invest 15%. Receive the stocks every 6 months with a 15% discount based on the average price over the 6 month period. Pays out in May and November.

Counting ESPP, bonus, and RSU grants I project to gross about $223k this year.



**Annual Savings:**

ESPP: Put in full 15%. Holding for LTCG then will sell and reinvest.

RSUs: Holding for now (inside trader list) but will eventually sell and reinvest.

Traditional 401k: $23,000 (max) not including 50% of first 6% company match

Mega Back Door Roth 401k: $14,000 (I put in as much as I can afford)

IRA - Typically max out, but will likely stop and instead put the full amount I can contribute into the Mega Back Door Roth 401k.

HSA - max (company contributes $600)

I target to save at least 40% of total income for retirement. (I count RSU and ESPP holdings as savings)



**Cash and equivalents:**

Capital One HYSA/Checking - $57,000 (I like to keep about 1 year of expenses in cash. This I consider my emergency fund but will use some for purchases if needed as long as the balance doesn’t go below $35-$40k)

CD - 5% - $200,000.00 matures next year. (I debated listing this. This was a gift from my mom  for a house. My parents helped my brother and his wife with their home over the years and she wants everything to be equal so she gifted this to me a few months ago. I have no plans to buy a house now, we agreed to put it into a 1 year 5% CD with her has the primary holder and I as the secondary. She insisted that she pay the taxes until I decide what I want to do with it. So far I exclude this from my retirement calc since this was unplanned. I’m incredibly fortunate, grateful, and still a bit shocked. Decided to lock it up for a year so I can think about the best use for this money)



**Investments:**



**Taxable: ($227,908.00)**

Brokerage 1: 

$7,229.00 (some individual stocks from when I first started investing I don’t want to sell)

Brokerage 2: 

$37,475.57 (about half individual stocks and half Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund)

Company Stock: $77,821.00 - Vested RSUs and ESPP

Old Company Stock 1: $3,978.00 - Vested

Old Company Stock 2: $34,532.00 - Vested (in the red, but believe it will come back. Willing to see for tax loss harvesting/offsetting income if needed.)

Brokerage 3: 

3 Fund Portfolio: $66,872.00 



**Roth Accounts: ($251,822.00)**

Fidelity Roth IRA: $127,299.00 

Fidelity Roth 401K: $26,233.00 (Current company)

Old Employer Roth 401k: $98,289.00



**Traditional Accounts: ($305,224.00)**

Fidelity IRA: $146,633.00

Fidelity 401K: $68,283.00 (Current company)

Old Employer 401K: $90,306.00



**HSA: ($34,948.95)**

Fidelity: $34,948.95 (60/20/20 US/International/Bond index funds)

Grand Total of investments: $821,102.00

Total Net Worth excluding Housing CD: $875,750.00



**Assets:**

2012 Ford Fusion - 65k miles - fully paid off - runs great but has had some minor issues recently. Want to keep for as long as I can.



**Debt: $3,400**

Normal monthly expenses on credit cards that are paid off each month. It's a bit higher this month due to a recent trip back home.



**Health:**

Good overall health. I take high blood pressure meds, and wear contact lenses. I currently have over a year's supply of lenses on hand. I think with a less stressful job I could get off the meds. I love working out, but have no time/energy now to develop a good routine. Diet would also likely be better since I'm a stress eater.



**Notes:**

\*Target investment mix is 60/20/20 although current allocation has drifted more to 65/20/15. I rebalance only if there is a 10% deviation from the target mix. I try to rebalance with new money. I do not take individual brokerages in account except for the 3 fund portfolio when determining the need to rebalance. I realize I probably should. I avoid fixed income investments in Roth accounts as best I can as I want that money to have the highest growth potential.

\*I front-load my 401k. I invest 50%+ of my paycheck into the traditional 401k until I only need to put enough in to get the full company match (they match 50% of my 6% contribution) for the rest of the year and still max out. Then I set my contribution to 6% and increase the contributions to the Mega Back Door Roth 401k. After front-loading my take home is around $2500 every 2 weeks. I sometimes get a small monetary gift from my mom at Christmas in lieu of presents. If needed I sell RSU/ESPP shares to subsidize living expenses while front loading, but I rarely need to do that.

\*Will eventually roll over old employer 401k into existing Roth/Traditional IRA.

\*Cash position used to be higher, but my dog got sick. It cost approximately $20k for his treatments/surgeries. I saved a separate fund for him and any potential health issues since I elected not to get pet insurance. I’m very happy I was able to provide him what he needed and not be too stressed about the money. I’m slowly rebuilding that to try and get back to around $60k-$65k, but really trying to focus on maximizing investments especially now that I have access to a Mega Back Door Roth 401K.

\*Planning on using the HSA for insurance/healthcare costs in retirement.

\*If I move my cost of living would likely decrease, but budgeting for it to be around the same just to be safe. Not sure what my salary in any new position would look like. 

According to Personal Capital, expenses have averaged around $75,000 a year the past 6 years. This is bit high as some of the expenses were work related or things I’d buy for my friends/family where I was reimbursed. When I used to track expenses closely my expenses were about $60,000 - $65,000 a year. My spending habits have not changed much from then. Rent is around $2400 a month and included in that total. I realize that rent is a lot relative to my take home pay, but I love my apartment and have no debt so I’m ok with it for now. I do eat out too much now, but really enjoy cooking and know I could (and have) live on less.

My goal is to save enough to have $80k-$100k a year (Thinking $2.5 million) in retirement. Hoping I won’t need to spend that much.

As mentioned above I have no long term debt.

Only upcoming major purchases I can think of are a new mattress and possibly a new couch as mine are pretty old and starting to get uncomfortable. I might also spring for a new computer as mine is 7 years old and starting to slow down a bit. I imagine the move might cost $5k or so. I don’t have a lot of stuff, but do have some things that will have to be shipped or transported by movers. If I live with my mom for a while I could put my things in storage and move them later.

Again so sorry for the long post. Generally I'm a very private person so this was difficult to post, but I feel really stuck and could use your advice. I appreciate you all! Thank you.",2024-11-10 20:33:12

Any ways to prevent in future?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1go9ua5/fake_check_cleared_my_account_suggestions_any/,11,"Never dealt with anything like this before, really unsure how this all goes. I am sorry if this is a little long winded, my mind has been racing this weekend.

I have issue this last week where a $7K fake/Forged check cleared my account on friday and noticed that evening. It proceeded to severely overdraw my checking account friday, so I am sitting on a seriously negative balance at the moment. I went to the Credit union yesterday morning and submitted a fraud report on the account and signed a affidavit. The manager who took the report basically told it will take up to 30 days to get my money back and even that is as long as fraud dept agrees that this is a fraudulent check (Why would they not?).

Since someone has access to my account info and is printing fake checks, She preceded to close the account and created a new account number. Which is going to cause problem of a few Direct deposits bouncing if I can't get them stopped in time.

Also, I couldn't get hold of the police apparently have to wait until Tuesday to file a report, which lead to another problem I only realized after the fact. Now that the old account is closed, I can't login into it and print the image of the check and the account statement. I imagine police will want for the report. Hoping Tuesday before I go to the police I can get the CU to print that out for me.

So my questions are this,

\* Beyond contacting the CU and reporting this and my filing a Police report. Is there anything else I might do to help things along? Is there anything I might be missing? Anything that I might do to make my life easier?

\* Second, I thought I was careful. I don't write personal checks or for that matter have ever had a checkbook, In fact as a side note I also don't have/use a debit card. Closest I do to writing checks is using the banks bill pay for few utility bills. I have always tried hard to isolate my cash and have no clue how someone might have gotten hold of my account info. This is why I know a check had to be printed or created and not stolen or washed, if that really even makes a difference.

With that said is there anything I might do in the future to prevent this from ever happening again? Any banks that might handle this better that I might change to?

For example on Credit Cards  I know companies will flag and reject suspicious transactions. It seems to me banks would do this with checks, however, obviously they do not. In my case it seems like if they did this would have flagged this because of the lack of historical checks, size of the check and Signature not matching, etc... are there any banks out there that might do this or this a system wide ""Check"" thing that for some reason they can't do? Or better yet banks you can tell just not to honor personal checks drawn at all?

I would love any insight. And appreciate you nice folks for hearing me out.",2024-11-10 20:19:56

I can't provide a ticker symbol because Empower's website is poorly set up. When I try to click the new fund name, it takes me to Morningstar where I get a ""NOTICKER"" error.

All I know about this new fund is from Empower's website: it has an expense ratio of 0.32% (VFIAX was 0.05%) and a 1-year performance of +11% (VFIAX was +26.6% YTD). So they put me in a fund that's not even close to the same with an expense ratio seven times higher than I was paying.

I was not notified of this change in any way, and I certainly wouldn't have authorized it. I checked the documents center, and they sent me a prospectus showing VFIAX was still an option 1 day before my funds were moved. There is no document explaining the move. If they stopped allowing investments in VFIAX, as it's not a choice for me now, don't they have to notify customers?

I called Empower on Saturday and the person I spoke to said I'd have to call back during business hours, so I won't be able to talk to anyone with any power until Tuesday (Monday is Veterans Day).

personalfinance,1go8hr4,Pay off debt or keep in savings until balance transfer promotion ends?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1go8hr4/pay_off_debt_or_keep_in_savings_until_balance/,5,"Hello. I would welcome some thoughts if any on my situation.

I have some debt that is now finally just under 10,000. I’ve paid a lot down to get to this point. Last year I had moved the debt to a new CC via transfer balance with 0% Apr which the promotion ends at the end of August 2025.

As of the end of this year I anticipate just over 15k saved up.

Debt is difficult for me. I’m not a spender. I care very much about saving and investing. But life circumstances always creep up and I’m not where I want to be at financially my age (late 30s). Perpetual survival mode.

I feel like the “responsible” thing to do is to continue keeping this money saved in a high yield savings account until August 2025 so I can earn some interest and then immediately pay it off right before the 0% apr ends. Also, you never know what happens in life and it’s good to have a cushion if Heaven forbid there are layoffs or something unexpected happens.

On the other hand, having the debt is mentally/emotionally taxing. Constant reminder of a bad time/relationship in my life (financial abuse). I want to move on. I’m tired of looking at a balance and the money I constantly work hard for is never mine while the other person evaded responsibility. Thankfully, they are now out of my life but obviously I’m still baring consequences. There is a part of me that says pay off the debt asap at the top of the year and then moving forward the money you earn is yours and the bills you have are yours and you won’t have this other lingering debt from a bad time in your life haunting you.

My savings is in a high yield savings account at 4.2% (sofi). By end of August I imagine earning anywhere from $300 to $420 more in interest. I give it a range bc the interest rate has gone down .4% in last few months and unsure if it’ll go down more or not. 

I earn about 50k a year and my expenses are about 2k per month. I save about 1,000 a month.

I guess I’m always weighing whether or not the interest and financial safety net for a potential unexpected event is worth the wait. ****I know I’m the only one who can truly answer that question.**** However, I welcome any thoughts or considerations.

Vehicle was repo'd in the middle of the night on election night, Tuesday.  It came as a shock to me. I saw no notice.

I immediately paid the balance I owed online plus a little more. 

**The next morning. I called Bridgecrest. They informed me they do not take online checks (routing number) with repossessions because they could bounce, and that I had to pay with a debit card.**

So I paid the amount I had already paid again, plus a repossession fee. They released it. 

I called the tow company who had my vehicle. I assumed I could just pick it up immediately.  I don't know how repo's work. 

So, I called the tow company and told them the car was released.

But to my surprise, they turned out to be very strict. They set an appointment and told me the earliest was MONDAY (tomorrow).

This was Wednesday. My pick up date is tomorrow. They made me wait 5 days to pick up my car I had taken care of Wednesday. 

The funny part is, I didn't even have to pay with a debit card, because the two company took so long to set an appointment pick-up date, that my online check ended up clearing within that time anyway.

All this to say, I had never even thought about the possibility of the tow company charging me to pick up my car. I just assumed that all that was taken care of through Bridgecrest.  

I would assume not.   Since they sneak around to take your property without your knowledge or request but at the request of the finance company, I would assume the finance company pays for those fees.

So I owe nothing when I pick up my vehicle, correct?

Meanwhile, however, my older car (a Hyundai elantra 2012, 120K miles) has completely stopped starting and has been in my building's parking lot collecting dust for months. It is not a battery issue, perhaps a starter or alternator issue according to O'reilly employee's guess. The other thing is that this car is almost a year past my state's (Colorado) yearly registration/tags as well as several months overdue on an emissions test I should've gotten in July.   
  
My question: What makes the most financial sense here? Do I get a diagnostic, repair the car (and get appraisal), pay up on paying late registration and emissions, then sell? Or is there anyway I can cut my losses by selling or donating the car? Does anyone have any experience or guidance on how to play this? This was my first car (I'm 37) so it is not familiar territory to me. Thank you in advance!

A few details:

\-If car was up and running my preference would be to sell it

\-I have enough savings to cover costs and excellent credit; if needed, I could pay to get car caught up and running if it sounds like a net gain in the longer term. 

\-late fees and late emissions will incur the maximum fee of $100 each ($200 total); I have $600 worth of brake rotor stuff to fix + whatever the current problem is that won't allow car to start. Depending on the issue, I assume that I'd need to pay roughly $1200-$1,800 to get car road ready and current on DMV requirements.

Hi I am looking for advice on how to help 'improve' my 26 year old brothers credit score. I downloaded clearscore for him today and he actually doesn't have a report at all.

Some perhaps unnecessary background information, he is serverely dyslexic, on the pathway for austim and adhd and in my opinion i believe he operates at a younger mental age due to a traumatic head injury in his teens. Might be irrelevant but i think it gives an insight to why he acts the way he does around finances etc. He has only ever had cash in hand jobs as a plasterer (not self employed and not a well payed one) in which he has not sorted his taxes and lasted 1 day in a warehouse for a popular homeware company because he couldn't read the codes. 

He currently lives with our grandparents, has no utility bills out in his name and due to his 'poor' credit score, my mum has had to take out his phone contract for him and it is unable to be transferred into his name because of this. I have registered him to vote today which should add something to his score I suppose?

When i went on the clearscores offers for credit building on the app, the only thing available to him was something called Loqbox. I have never heard of this company before. I also tried to get a credit building card for him from captial one but he got rejected. 

Does anyone have any ideas or help that can help us get his score up. Because of his score he is unable to get a flat without a gaurentor, which my mum wont agree to do and I do not earn enough to be able to be one for him if he misses a payment. ",2024-11-10 17:18:48

Here’s my situation: 

My little brother (19) and I (22) are interested in purchasing a duplex/triplex/sfh in the coming year or so (in MN). Our preferences would be a duplex or triplex, but we are interested in buying a SFH, and staying in it for 5 years and then reevaluating then on what to do with this property. 

Rationale: We want to lock in a stable payment as rents can be variable and have generally increased overtime. Having a home, we would have a fixed cost, potential for building equity, and the invaluable experience of homeownership/rental property management experience. 

Finances: I make around $59k a year not including commission. I have around $15k saved for a down payment right now. (I will continue to add around $300 a month to this until we purchase). My brother is in a trade program and will be finished up in 26’ and should be making around $70k a year. He wouldn’t be putting much down, but would help with getting other costs such as renovations, furniture, etc. I would still like to max out my ROTH (non-negotiable), would like to put as much as possible into 401k. I currently have $17k in emergency savings, $15k in ROTH, and currently maxing out my 401k 

Question: Would this be a good investment long term? Our plan would be to live in one side if we do purchase a duplex and rent out the other. But if we can’t find a duplex/triplex we would be open to a SFH. Would this be a bad investment? - I would only be comfortable buying something that is undervalued, and would require some renovations to force equity from day one.

Hi Reddit! My partner and I are new parents, and we’re trying to find the best credit card to maximize our cash back on regular expenses. We use a shared bank account and credit card to manage groceries, gas, and occasional travel and car rentals, but mainly groceries. Here’s a breakdown of our situation:
— Monthly Grocery Spend: About $700
— Other Expenses: Mostly gas and occasional travel expenses 

—Primary Goal: Maximize cash back or rewards for everyday essentials
	•	Bonus: We noticed that some places offer discounts or cashback on specific grocery categories, so we’re open to cards that might offer benefits like this.

Currently, we’re considering options like the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express for its 6% back on groceries. However, we’re open to other recommendations if they better fit our spending habits. We also want to keep things simple, so if a card has an annual fee, we’d like it to have significant enough benefits to make up for it.

For those of you in a similar situation or with experience, which card do you think would be the best choice? Would love any insights on hidden fees, special rewards, or perks that we might be overlooking. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-10 16:34:15

I currently have about that amount of money set aside that I could use to pay the loan down further (bank pays 3% on cash, loan is only 1.9%), use as a down payment on a lesser CPO vehicle, or pay cash for a cheap car.

I know it was a dumb decision to buy the car in the first place, even though I needed a car, I could have been more prudent and purchased something that wasn't new. Now I am just trying to figure out the best way to get myself out of it. I don't have the money to pay the car off, otherwise I would do that, then sell private with a clean and clear title and pay myself back.

My current thought is to trade it in on the cheaper car, roll the negative equity, and use the money I have set aside as a down payment for the loan.

Nice homes in my desired area are $750k - $1M. It seems like I _could_ make it work, but I'm not sure I want to put that much into a house right now.

The alternative is a cheaper house that I would not enjoy as much but is a safer buy. I would probably like to sell this home after some time which makes me worry about valuation long term.

Based on this, am I able to do a mega backdoor Roth?



What are In-Plan Roth Conversions?

Ordinarily, you do not pay taxes on the contributions or earnings of your accounts attributable to your employer's contributions (including accounts attributable to Employer matching contributions and accounts attributable to Employer profit sharing contributions) until you receive an actual distribution from such accounts because such amounts are usually held in what is called ""pre-tax"" accounts. In other words, the taxes on the contributions and earnings in your pre-tax accounts are deferred until a distribution is made. Roth accounts, however, are the opposite. With a Roth account you pay current taxes on the amounts contributed. When a distribution is made to you from the Roth account, you do not pay taxes on the amounts you had contributed. In addition, if you have a ""qualified Roth distribution"", you also do not pay taxes on the earnings that are attributable to the contributions. See the Q&A called ""What are my tax consequences when I receive a distribution from the Plan?"" for the definition of a qualified Roth distribution.

This Plan allows an In-Plan Roth conversion feature. That means that a portion of your funds that are already in one or more of your tax-deferred accounts under the Plan can be converted from a pre-tax basis to a Roth tax basis. For tax purposes, such recharacterized amounts will be treated by the Plan as if such funds had been Roth deferrals to your account, i.e., they will not be taxed at the time of distribution. That is because you will be taxed on the total amount being converted to a Roth tax basis for the year in which such conversion(s) are made.

Once you make an election to convert an amount to a Roth tax basis, your election cannot be changed. It's important that you understand the tax effects of making the election and ensure you have adequate resources outside of the plan to pay the additional taxes. The In-Plan Roth transfer does not affect the timing of when a distribution may be made to you under the Plan; the transfer only changes the tax character of your account. You should consult with your tax advisor prior to making a transfer election.

There are two conversion options available under the plan, In-plan Roth Rollovers and In-plan Roth Transfers. Each type of conversion is described in greater detail in the two Questions that immediately follow, because there are some technical differences between the two types.

What are In-Plan Roth Rollovers?

In-Plan Roth Rollovers. If you are eligible for a distribution from an account, you may elect to roll over all or a portion of the distribution to a designated Roth contribution account in the Plan (referred to as an In-Plan Roth Rollover). You may only roll over the distribution directly. If you wish to convert all or a portion of a non-distributable account to a Roth tax basis, see the Question

""What are In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfers?""

The following limitations apply to the In-Plan Roth Rollovers:

• No more than 2 transfers may be made during a Plan Year.

The law restricts any in-service distributions from certain accounts which are maintained for you under the Plan before you reach age 59 1/2. These accounts are the ones set up to receive your salary deferral contributions and other Employer contributions which are used to satisfy special rules for 401(k) plans. Ask the Administrator if you need more details.

What are In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfers?

In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfers. As a Participant under the Plan, you may make an In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfer. An In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfer allows you to elect to change the tax treatment of all or some of the vested portion of your pre-tax accounts, as explained below.

Conditions and Limitations. The following limitations apply to the In-Plan Roth Rollover Transfer:

• No more than 2 transfers may be made during a Plan Year.",2024-11-10 15:42:34

Let me give you my situation and you tell me if that's still the case.

\*450k home value in CA with 190k left to pay current mortgage payment $1700

\*4.375 APR currently refi would be to 6.2%, Mortgage payment would bump to around $2000

\* HELOC would be for 70k at 9% or $500ish dollars a month

The cash out would be for a new car, eliminating 10k credit card debt and an emergency fund of around 15-20k

Increasing income at the moment or near future is not an option. I'm trying to eliminate as much monthly debt as possible while upgrading quality of life (New Car, Less debt) So with this move id would eliminate car payment($200) CC debt ($200) and perhaps more with gas($400?) because of the EV purchase. So we a relooking at a swing of around +$500 per month. With a HELOC it would be adding more to my monthly expenses. I understand I'm basically resting my mortgage and in the long run I would pay a shit ton more in interest.

The amount sitting in the IRA currently is just shy of 300k. Split 50/50 between another beneficiary.

I am a disabled veteran, 80% rated bumped up to 100% via TDIU. The VA has ruled it permanent and total, I'm considered 100% disabled through the VA. I have spent the last 5 years with this as a fact, prior to that I was enlisted. 

I take home no taxable income, completely living off the VA disability.

I'm 42 years old and live a simple life of which the 45k I make a year via disability takes care of my needs. I'm not sure what to do here, I'm wondering if taking it all out asap and tossing it into a HYSA would be the best bet or something else.

My monthly payment is $628/month @ 12.72% with Santander. I know this APR is very high, I’m young and it’s my first ever loan, it’s the best offer I got, I’m still building my credit, etc. What’s done is done. 

I got this car in May, so I have been making payments for 6-7 months now. I have been making a lot of extra payments, my loan balance starting out was ~$32,253 and the term was 75 months. Today the balance is a little over $24,000. I plan on making as many extra payments as possible even if I refinance and pay off this loan ASAP as I have been doing. 

I looked at two different offers to refinance my car. The first one is with a credit union, APR would be 8.24% and term would be 60 months. The second is with Caribou, APR would be 6.49% and the term would be 84 months. I am leaning more towards the credit union because they have a location where I live and my parents have a car loan through them and the loan term is shorter. I haven’t heard of Caribou much it was just suggested through credit karma and I don’t want to drag out my loan term. 

Here is my question. My mom is telling me to not refinance my car because I have been paying it off quickly so she is saying that the high interest doesn’t matter that much, that I wont pay much interest because I’m paying it off quick and that I’ll have to pay a lot of fees to refinance so it won’t be worth it. But I feel like I should refinance because it would save at least a little bit of interest and what if something were to happen and I wasn’t able to make extra payments like I am doing now. And also the offer I got from the credit union for 8.24% is still high so I don’t know if I should wait a little bit longer to get a better rate as my credit score is getting better. 

What advice do you have or what would you do in my situation? Refinance or just keep paying off as much as possible? Or wait for a better rate/try to find a better rate at a different bank/credit union? ",2024-11-10 15:02:52

personalfinance,1gnzjw4,HELOC refinancing advice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnzjw4/heloc_refinancing_advice/,4,"My wife is a realtor (commission only) and I am a salary policeman. She had a pretty rough year for 2024. Her grandmother, with whom she was pretty close with passed away, and a handful of other inconveniences caused her to not want to work as much. She still managed to gross around 65K and my yearly salary is 70K. Before my law enforcement career, I was a carpenter. Back in June of 2022, she was working with a client that had a 1944 house with 1 acre that he wanted to get rid of. We toured the house and payed $15,000 for it. We took out a HELOC for $40,000 with the aspirations of doing a simple “makeover”, windows, buying appliances, painting, flooring, etc. and renting it. 

Long story short, there were a lot of foundation/structural issues that had to be fixed, I became a detective and got very busy, and we’ve had a hard time finding reliable contractors. We surpassed $40K within a year. We still have quite a bit of work to do on the house but it’s costing us too much now to save any money. 

Our current HELOC balance is $39,875 of $40,000. The interest rate is 11.2% and the monthly payment is $377 (this is all interest). This has pushed my credit score down to 701 :(   
My wife’s car will be paid off next month and that will free up $417/month. We have our second child on the way and want to sell the property. We expect to sell around 100-115K but I foresee it could be another 8-12 months before it’s 100% complete. 

I got a quote for a $40,000 personal loan with no collateral, and no origination fees from SoFi, with a 5 year term at 14.96% APR, at $894/month. If we end up keeping the property for over a year, would it make sense to do this or get a 15 year $40K mortgage on the property at ~6.5%. My main goal is to at least start making some dent in the balance, but not go broke until we sell the place.

personalfinance,1gnyufl,Best Approach Towards Paying Down Debt?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnyufl/best_approach_towards_paying_down_debt/,4,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice as to how to best approach my situation to becoming debt free.  For context, I had just graduated university in May and during that time, I became unemployed and accrued some debt for living expenses over the past 1-1.5 years.  It took me 6 years to finish as I kept switching majors.  I was using my savings as well as student loans to make payments during this time and my credit score tanked as I was being conservative.  Since the grace period is ending, I would have an increase in monthly payments.  I live in a HCOL area (Bay Area) but I live at home with my parents, currently studying to pass my board exams (Nursing).  In the meantime, I had started a new job in the past month working as a nursing assistant in a hospital.  With my normal hours and differential, my biweekly pay is about $1900 a paycheck. After picking up OT, my biweekly take home pay is $2500-3000 a paycheck depending on OT availability. Goal to increase my earnings would be to pass my exam and find a job in the field as soon as I can.  Therefore most of my time is spent between working and studying.  In the meantime, at least before the grace period ends, I would like to have a plan for paying down debt, possibly refinancing my student loans, and become debt free.  What is the best approach to do this? Debt information is as follows:

Sallie Mae Loan 1:

$17,000 @ 11.875%, , $215 est monthly payment

Sallie Mae Loan 2:

$25,000 @ 10.75% $289 est monthly payment

Sallie Mae Loan 3:

Federal Loan:

Important to note that I cannot simply gift the car. I need reasonable value to put towards my new purchase. It can either be lump sum or monthly payments to me in order to roll into my new vehicle payment. 

I don’t think my child can obtain an official loan from an institution at this time to pay me in full.

I currently contribute to my company's 401k plan with every paycheck, but my employer doesn't match at all which kind of sucks.

I am in no student debt and drive a fully paid off car, so I don't have many expenses outside of rent, food, and fun stuff.

I have about $31k in a HYSA that receives around 4.5% interest. I recently saw a TikTok about how it's kind of dumb to have this much money in my savings account as it's more than enough for even a full year of rent and expenses for me.
I also thought that the money in a Roth IRA couldn't be touched until retirement without huge tax penalties, which is what had deterred me from opening one previously, but upon further research it looks like I can pull the principal ($7k) out whenever, just not any money I make from investing that $7k. So even if something went horribly wrong in my life, I could always just pull that $7k back out, right?

Should I take $7k from my HYSA and move it into a Roth before the year is over? I have no presence in the stock market, either. Alternatively, should I skip the Roth and just start investing some of the money from my HYSA into the stock market?

I tired to explain to him that he won’t be retiring for 50 plus years and has plenty of time to save for that, so take these 2 years and put as much money together to put on a house, making his mortgage less and then he can add more money to his retirement.  These will be the only 2 years in his life that he will be able to bank the majority of his paycheck.  In 2 years he will be moving into his own home or an apartment.
Does anyone agree with my thought process?  At 25, put your retirement on “hold” for just 2 years and get as much money as possible to reduce that mortage payment. What’s the point of saving for retirement if you have a $300,000.00 mortage, with a rate repayment of 6 % for the next 30 years. ",2024-11-10 17:11:20

I’m currently filling out a W-4 for a new, full time job at a call center. I’m only 20 years old so I don’t have much experience in doing so. I currently have a different, sorta part-time job as my dad’s caregiver. The money I make from that caregiving job, as far as I know, is not taxes. I make a decent living at my age as his caregiver with a high hourly rate, but since the hours per day is so low, it’s part-time, and I’ll be making more at my new full time job at the call center than I am as a caregiver, by around 7k or so, but both in the 30-39k range. I get paid biweekly at my caregiving job and I’ll be getting paid weekly at my new job at the call center. I also plan to keep both jobs.

My questions are:

- Should I add the caregiving job to my W-4 as a “second job” (checking the box)? 

- If so, in step 4, what should I put in the blank spaces for A, B, and C of step 4? And should I only do 1 of them, or all 3?

- How would/should I go about doing/calculating that? Do I calculate the new, higher-paying job, or do I calculate the old, lower paying job?

The reason I ask is because whenever you pay your credit card bills, it works in a funny way. There is a section in the credit card's page called ""Pending"", which shows how much of an addition or deficit is pending to be applied to the credit card.

So if you pay $100 to your credit card, it will now appear under that section ""Pending: +$100"".

You set that aside for your ""Repair/Maintenance fund"". This is the fund that you use, if you have to get a roof leak fixed, or you have plumbing issues or electrical issues. Maybe you need a new furnace. Maybe your AC goes out. 

Anyways, if the house is 700k, then that means that supposedly, you're supposed to set aside 7k per year into this fund, to prepare for when you might need those funds for repairs. That factors out to about $583 per month that you'd put in this repair/maintenance fund.

Here's my question:

Assuming you had a good home inspecition when you bought the house, would you really need to do this with the maintenance fund? Reason being, I'd imagine your home inspector would have pointed out all the various problems and you'd have either negotiated with the seller to get them fixed, or to get a discount on the purchase price for some of the problems, or however you'd potentially work that out. But, it'd seem like you'd probably fix or handle the issues that really need handling, right around the time of the house purchase or shortly thereafter.

So, it'd seem like maybe you wouldn't need any repair/maintenance fund for the first couple of years at least, again, assuming you had a high-quality home inspection done, and the inspector really knew his stuff, and pointed out every potential problem to possibly rectify, sooner, rather than later. Assuming that was done very well, the only other thing you'd need to worry about in the first couple of years is something super random, and most likely your homeowners insurance would cover it. Of course, I do understand the line of thinking that says that you don't want to have claims on your homeowners insurance early on in the life of the policy or your time being at that property.

personalfinance,1gnncov,Repair car totaled by insurance?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnncov/repair_car_totaled_by_insurance/,12,"My car was recently totaled out by my insurance. Repairs around $9k while they’re valuing the car at $8.6k. After including my deductible and paying off the remainder of my loan, I’ll be getting about $3k from my insurance. 

I’m looking around at new (used) cars, and not seeing much good news anywhere. I purchased my 2017 Jetta in April of 2020 for $12k. It had 22k miles at the time, and has 104k on the odometer today. 

I like the car a lot, it’s been very mechanically sound, and I’ve always told myself I’d drive it for many years to come. The fender bender that caused all this mess didn’t even prevent me from driving the rest of the way home. I was honestly intending on bypassing insurance, and paying what I assumed would be $3-4k in repairs out of pocket, until the body shop hit me with $9k instead. 

I would be more confident in my Jetta after repairs than any other car off a used lot with similar mileage. I’ve taken damn good care of it. The auto body shop it’s currently at would use all OEM parts and is very highly regarded in the area.  

However, I have no idea the logistics behind something like this, and my Geico claims agent is currently enjoying his weekend like I’m trying to. Would Geico allow me to do this? Would they be willing to continue covering the vehicle after repairs are made? I have my homeowners policy and other car’s insurance through them still. I believe that this would result in a change to the vehicle’s Title, being that it was deemed a total loss, but I don’t really care about that. I don’t plan on selling the car  

Assuming I get $3k from insurance, I can pay the remaining $6k needed for repairs out of pocket. My emergency fund will be dented, but not depleted. In my mind, I would then own the car free and clear with no more monthly payment for financing. 

My other option would be to buy something else, but everything with an equal reliability to my old Jetta seems to be sitting right under $20k or so. I’d be looking to put 20% down on a 48 month max loan (not making the same mistake twice with longer term loans). Even with a 730 credit score, I’m being offered loans at 9% and $420+ monthly payments 

I’m currently looking at Honda Accords or Civics, Subaru Legacy (the 4wd would be very useful to me), or another Jetta. I’m trying to keep miles <70k. I know it’s not an exactly equal comparison for my Jetta with 104k, but I’ve babied the thing for the last 80,000 miles and am confident in it. Spending ~$12k on a car with 100k miles just seems like a big gamble, regardless of make or model. A lot of life happens over 100,000 miles, how am I to assume this car was taken care of for all of that time? 

Repairing my own car seems like my best bet, but I really feel like I must be overlooking something here, because I don’t hear about other people pursuing this course of action when they’re in a similar situation. 

Sorry the post is so long, I really appreciate whatever advice anyone here has for me. I’m out of my realm here",2024-11-09 23:46:01
personalfinance,1go0vnk,Why keep an emergency fund?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1go0vnk/why_keep_an_emergency_fund/,19,"Now I’m pretty avid in my personal finance journey. I’ve made some pretty note worthy mistakes throughout the years, but I’ve also held some of the basic repeated personal finance beliefs without any reflection or criticism. Don’t get me wrong, I agree with the majority of common advice because it just makes sense, mathematically and straightforwardly. 

The past few months I’ve been really criticizing the idea of keeping an emergency fund. Now, given, I’ve never been put in a position where I’ve had to break it out yet, but something about keeping tens of thousands in my savings gaining 4-5% annually (now lowering), doesn’t sit right with me. 

Hypothetically, let’s say I have a taxable brokerage account worth $50k, and an emergency fund worth $20k. I decide to move $15k from my emergency fund to my brokerage, leaving me with $5k in somewhat of a rainy day fund I can use for car repairs, medical emergencies, etc. I now have $65k being invested. Oh no what’s that? The market crashed 50% during pre market and I lost my job? Thankfully, it now only takes 1 business day for my funds to settle and be withdrawn, meaning I can cover whatever expenses I have from my brokerage (now worth $32.5k). I’ll get back on my feet and continue life as normal, maximizing my investments. 

I’m a firm believer of questioning everything, even the things that seem to just make sense, but I’d appreciate any feedback so I can get everyone’s point of view. ",2024-11-10 13:39:41

(UK),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnmxt9/any_advice_on_how_to_improve_my_credit_score_uk/,2,"For context, my credit score was great until I went to university. I applied for a £1.5k overdraft from Santander to pay for my rent deposit, which was also £1.5k. While I tried to save and put money back into the account, I’d occasionally dip into it when money got tight, especially for food.

Long story short, a year after graduating, Santander passed my account to a credit agency, and I had to rely on Universal Credit to start paying it back. As you can imagine, it’s taking a long time since, two years after graduating, I still haven’t found a job. When my details were handed over to the credit company, my score decreased significantly, and now I’m in the poor credit range with a score of 609.

I’ve got around £900 left to pay off. I’ve been making monthly repayments since last year, but I haven’t had much success in boosting my credit score. Thankfully, no interest has been added, but I really want to clear this debt and improve my score. Aside from my student loans and this overdraft, I don’t have any other debts. I’ve already paid off my phone bill and bought my last phone, so now I’m just on a pay-as-you-go plan that’s £15/month.

I’m doubtful I can get a credit card with my low score (and I’ve never really wanted one), so I’m wondering what else I could do. I’ve considered the Loqbox site, but I’m unsure if it’s legit. Has anyone used it? What other steps could I take to boost my credit score? I’m worried that my low score could affect my ability to rent once I finally secure a job and move out.

Hi everyone! 

I would really appreciate your opinion on this. I’m (25) single, no kids, no debts. I don’t go out much and I work hybrid. My job is not that far away from where I live. I use Uber to get there since public transportation here sucks (I’m not from USA. I live in Latin America). 

I don’t earn a lot but I could finance a car. The the thing is I’m currently saving for an apartment. I’m renting a bedroom to a woman but I don’t really like living there. It’s a nice place but the lady is mean to the people who works at the apartment. I have never confronted her because I’m afraid of getting kicked off. I’m still here because paying for a bedroom allows me save a little more. Again, I don’t earn enough. 

That being said, I was really hoping to save enough money to finance a apartment. However, I know it should be the other way around. I should buy a car first. 

Can anyone give me some advice please on what to do?

His uncle was very knowledgeable and had managed to double the portfolio over the past five years, regularly monitoring it. Before he passed, he told my dad it would be fine to leave the investments as they were for up to a year.

My dad recently met with an agent from Fidelity who confirmed that his uncle’s strategy seemed solid. The agent recommended keeping most of the portfolio unchanged, with the exception of selling a couple of underperforming stocks. Currently, the portfolio is valued at about $4 million, with around 90% in stocks spread across 40 different companies.

The issue is that this level of stock exposure goes against what I’ve heard—particularly that as people age, they should shift more toward bonds. My dad is hesitant to make any major changes because he’s concerned about the capital gains tax he might face if he shifts heavily into bonds.

My dad lives quite frugally, primarily relying on Social Security and an annuity, rather than the portfolio itself.

Should he trust the Fidelity agent’s advice to keep this aggressive stock allocation, or would it be safer to consider reallocating to bonds? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",2024-11-09 21:51:15
personalfinance,1gnkxrt,Pay debt down or hold on for a little while longer,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnkxrt/pay_debt_down_or_hold_on_for_a_little_while_longer/,0,"Hello all, I’m seeking advice on what might be the best course of action. 

Some backstory: 24m moved out from parents house at 21 in 2022 with no degree and next to no plan. Got myself into ~10k credit card debt out of sheer irresponsibility. It wasn’t due to being uninformed, just spent a shit ton of money and did not care about the consequences. Well now I do. 

Over the last ~2 years since the debt got to its highest point I have since started to take life seriously and am desperate to get out of this hole and finally begin to move forward in life. I have been steadily working as long as I have been on my own and I’ve had some crypto investments since the boom of 2021. I basically bought just below the highest point of the boom in 2021 and have held onto most of it to this day(basically lost a bunch of money for a few years until this latest boom started months ago). That money is now relevant again. 

I have been paying down the debt for the last few years but due to unfortunate circumstances I have had to use those cards for big purchases/emergencies a few times. The debt has basically hovered between 8-9k this entire time. 

Regardless of where your politics stand, Trumps victory in the US presidential election caused a spike in crypto prices, and I am finally above water from my original break even point when I initially bought my crypto. If I were to cash out all my crypto, it would be almost the exact amount of money to erase all of my credit card debt. 

I have about $2.5k in a regular savings account and I take home about $2400/month and my rent is $1020/month, after utilities I’d say I pay ~$1100/month. 

My question(s) is, 

1. Should I cash out all my crypto and eliminate my debt? Effectively allowing me to start fresh and begin saving for a house
- I have proven to myself I can survive on my current wages while spending only cash and would be able to save considerably more than I have been while drowning in debt
-My concern with this option is what my tax situation might become and would I be able to pay my taxes or not

2. Should I cash out my crypto and leave it sitting in a savings account until tax season is over?
- I would continue to pay down my debt to the best of my ability and leave the crypto earnings in savings until I have to pay my taxes
-Ultimately this option would give me peace of mind knowing I sold my crypto and made money, unlike the last boom where I missed out on the selloff and was stuck with practically worthless crypto for a few years
-unfortunately not paying off the debt the right away would not ease my mind knowing I am still accruing interest

3. Let the crypto ride and potentially hit a point where the market tanks and I lose out on potential earnings for years?

Sorry for such a long post but thank you to anyone who reads any of this

More backstory: Being in such debt for these few years has added so much unnecessary stress to my life and has seriously affected my mental health and self esteem and I have not allowed myself to date or make new friends this entire time. (I understand I have absolutely nobody to blame but myself and these are the consequences of my own actions)",2024-11-09 21:51:06

Trying to decide between converting after-tax 401k contributions to a Roth 401k or Roth IRA.

My original intention was to convert to Roth IRA, but the folks at Fidelity suggested keeping it as 401k without much further explanation. I somewhat suspect this is because I currently don’t have an IRA with them, but a different brokerage. Please advise any other possible reasons, or if my below assumptions are incorrect!

Pros/Cons/Questions for each-

Mega Backdoor Roth 401k:
- Protected from creditors
- Doesn’t count as assets for FAFSA 
- Cons: little investment flexibility & must follow Roth 401k RMD rules, and 401k plan fees

Mega Backdoor Roth IRA:
- Flexibility for choosing my own investments woth lower ETF/fund fees
- No plan fees 
- Assumption: Can withdraw contributions early before standard retirement without penalty, similar to standard Roth IRA
- Assumption 2: this does not count towards my standard $7000 IRA contribution for the year?

Is there any reason why I need to choose at this stage? Are there cons to starting with the Mega Backdoor Roth 401k and rolling to Roth IRA later?

Thanks very much!

A little bit before my dillema. I just started a new job at a non profit. I finished my Probation Period (which as far as I can tell doesn't mean much), and the job is fine. I make about 45k/year.
My manager is a little weird, and some of the stories I hear from people that got fired in the past makes me always be on the edge with my job. He makes me feel like I could be fired at any time, and I do not really enjoy this feeling, so it adds up to my paranoia/worry about still being employed and what should I do with the money.

I have absolutely 0 living costs (EDIT: I pay 143/mo for our phone bill (3 ppl), my own insurance and car atm, so not necessarily 0 living costs, but fairly low), no rent and even food if I don't purchase anything. I make ~2700 after tax a month, I put 5% to my ROTH IRA (with 10% matching from my employer, and yes, that's correct), as well as fully funded 2024 ROTH IRA. 

I currently have 11k in my HYSA. My vehicle, a 2020 Corolla with ~67K miles on it, has just about 8600 left on it. I initially got is as a lease in October 2020, bought off the lease in 2022 at 2.99% interest, and I am NOT underwater on the car, I just visited a couple dealerships and they offered me 11k on it.

My huge dillema is, due to my constant worry about my job status (even though approaching the holidays and him taking a ton of time off, for example). Should I use these funds to fully pay off my car? I got 38 months left on it (The finance was 62 months at 2.99)
Or should I wait for Jan 1, 2025 and fully-fund my ROTH IRA at the beginning of the year? That was my initial plan, but I constantly worry about the amount of time it would take me to find a new position in case something happens. That would leave me with about 2400 left in my HYSA, plus some money in the checkings, considering I still have a credit card or two to pay off (never carried a balance ever tho).

I know that mathematically I should just put the 7K in the Roth IRA asap, since that should wield more than the 2.99 interest I currently pay on, but I also worry that not having it paid-off could be an issue...
I do not have a very good budget and I tend to purchase stuff to myself with a higher price-tag, especially recently, which should be changing pretty soon as I already achieved whatever sparkly things I want, and I recognize it is a bad trait and something I have to improve (Working with CHATGPT on that eventually).

I would really appreciate you guys thoughts and concerns. ",2024-11-09 21:43:27

Everything else about the job was great, I loved the people, management was fair, benefits were generous. My bosses were sad to see me go and told me I was always welcome to come back. They have a hard time finding good workers and I think they would take me back if I ever wanted to. I am sad to leave, but it is something I have wanted to do for years now, I made a post about a year ago asking for advice and lamenting my job.

My plan is to go see some family for the holidays, do some traveling, and enjoy my life for a little while until I can figure something else out.

Finances:

265,000 - Non-retirement investments

120,000- Savings or Money market

125,000 - 401k/Roth

Will this be a terrible move career wise?

Can I afford this?

Or can I just pay the loan off with the 0% apr card and just do the balance transfer that way? Are there any other options?

I’m 26F - my mum and dad are separating and I just want someone to tell me what to do, I’m currently trying to work it all out myself and it’s getting me down. 

Not an amicable separation. Mum cheated. Mum is demanding her half of the house. 

£240k house. Mortgage fully paid off. My dad took early pension pot at 55 and paid £20k to clear the mortgage… mum left straight after. 

My dad and little brother reside at the family home. They would very much like to remain there.

Dad (57) is a CIS worker earning and filing his own tax returns. No guaranteed work, but has someone employing him on different jobs. He earns around £35k a year. Unfortunately he has had multiple brain surgeries in the past few years and due another one in December, so that will be something to bear in mind. 

I can take out a mortgage to - I think - finance my mum out of the property.  I don’t think dad can get a mortgage at his age. Would you choose equity release to pay my mum off and then dad gets on a lifetime mortgage? 

Another thing to bear in mind is that whilst I want my dad to be safe healthy and happy (my brother too), I also want to buy my first home with my partner soon. So helping dad out with a mortgage will affect my first time buyer status and will cost loads of stamp duty when eventually buying my own home. 

There’s not much you can get for £120k in Nottingham where they live - assuming half of the house sale. I want my dad to live comfortably in somewhere nice.

To add on to that, I have an expense coming in the next few weeks that will be about $1600 (CAD) or so as well, and I have no choice but to pay for it- I may need to partially use the credit card as well for it. I know that if I don’t pay the balance off (by November 8th- the statement balance is $1100 ) interest will accrue immediately on everything I purchase, including this huge payment. After basic expenses I have $1000 each month (paid at the end of the month), but won’t be able to throw absolutely all of it to the card. So I have a few questions. 

- Is it better to make the big purchase early/now, rather than after the payment due date, to avoid accruing immediate interest, or have I got that wrong/is this a bad idea? Does it make no difference?
- How long am I looking at to pay this off with around a 20% interest rate, paying it off at any given amount each month? 
- How badly does this affect me in the long run? I.e after I’ve paid it off, will my credit (FICO) just be screwed if I let it sit a few months? 
- In general, is it better to save money to pay off the card in lump sum once I have it all saved, or better to just chip in what I can when I can? I’m leaning towards the latter because that saves $ on interest and I’d probably end up paying more immediately than money I’d save. But again, I don’t know.
- What can I do? What would the best option be here and how screwed am I? 

I just want to get this over with and start my life again. Everything was fine until emergencies happened, I know I needed to have an emergency fund but I DID it just wasn’t enough, and I’m young and don’t make a lot of money. I just want to get out of it. Any thoughts appreciated. And if anybody can easily come up with a bit of a plan to follow, I’d be more than grateful. I’m so stressed out that it’s all I’m thinking about, yet I can’t think straight about actionable measures. Please ask if anything needs to be clarified. Thank you",2024-11-09 17:01:47

To elaborate on some comments.

\*\*\*I have this feeling of being left behind due to my prior mistakes. This would involve gambling, stocks, not saving. I have since learned how stupid this was so I would like to turn over a new leaf and not look for fast money.

My company matches approx 3% so I will continue to keep that going. I may be expecting a small raise (\~maybe 6%) and a small EOY bonus (unknown). All this will be going to debt with minimized spending on Christmas gifts, girlfriend, etc. I am also considering getting a second remote job as well so I can play catch up.

I'm 36 years old, have been paying my student loans off for the past 8 years.

I have 40,000 remaining on the student loans. My mother recently inherited some money, and is offering me a $60,000 interest-free loan to pay off my student loans, and the remaining $20,000 to consolidate all my other debt. I'll be paying her back $600 a month.

How does this work from a tax perspective, for both she and I? Should my mother just file a Form 709 and treat this as a gift?

My basic understanding of the gift tax is that the limit is $18,000 for a given year, and that just because the limit is $18,000 doesn't mean my mother would pay any taxes on it - it just adds to some life time total of $13 million? So my mother wouldn't actually pay any extra taxes, right?

Do I need to file anything on my end? 

I had read something about potentially charging a small amount of interest (whatever the minimum is) to avoid the whole gift tax limit and deducting the interest payments, but that didn't seem to make sense to me.

Current situation:

Downsides: 
- I don’t believe in the company’s direction, leadership and there’s no career progression. We have had redundancies this time last year, and again now. The business isn’t doing well. 

Upsides: 
- I have full remote work, meaning I can work abroad, and we have moved abroad (unofficially, the company doesn’t know so I travel back for meetings once a month or so), autonomy over my schedule, and a decent salary with good maternity benefits (26weeks full pay).

Context:

- I’m in my 30s, just started trying for a baby.
- I have a side hustle bringing in £700/month.
- I’m unsure of my next career move and haven’t had the headspace to figure it out.
- I think would struggle to find another corporate job as flexible as I have, so would mean leaving to do my own thing I think 
- If enough don’t volunteer then they will pick people to make redundant, but I’ve been told I am not at risk to be picked. So if I want to go it has to be via voluntary. 


Should I stay for the flexibility and decent maternity benefits, or take the redundancy, have six months of financial cushion, and figure out my next step?

I am a newer federal employee (\~2years). My partner and I have our hands full with a little one and just became SAHM due to feeding issues. We feel disconnected and are considering moving closer to family to help out and be closer to them.

I previously worked private consulting and while I enjoyed the work was very stressed and worked longer hours. I currently really enjoy my fed job so far: interesting work, decent pay, good benefits ( 3 month paid paternity leave and pension), short commute, flexible hours and telework, and great work life balance.

We currently live outside a metro area. We did not anticipate little one when buying our home. It is an older home and has been somewhat of a headache: flooded garage, fence blowing over, lots repairs in general. Hard to find the time to fix myself and don’t have the money to pay contractors pricing. It is a 1000sqft but the layout makes it feel cramped, there are no sidewalks, it is off a busy street, we sometimes get unhoused passing by (no encounters but still feel somewhat unsafe walking just alone). There are not a lot of kid friendly areas and do not feel any sense of community. On the plus side we have easy access to amenities and outdoors which we value a lot, very close to work, and a small backyard (not all houses have in area). Current intrest rate of 3.375 and mortgage of $2080 on current one income this is about 43% of net pay. Not great but hopefully partner is back part time or full time in 2-3 years.

I’ve come up with three potential solutions:

1. Stay at current job and move to more desirable/kid friendly area and newer house with less maintenance. Pro: Stay fed, still have outdoor access Con: Finance would be tough for likely 5 years (likely house poor and not saving a lot), family still far away and may not find community and still want to move
2. Move to DMV area and apply for different fed position. Pro: Very close to family, remain fed. Con: Higher housing, higher cost of living, lower pay for similar position
3. Go back to private consulting and move to SW VA. Potential remote work that would pay more than I make now.  Pro: good outdoor access, closer (\~1.5hrs to family), potentially more kid friendly activities, lower cost of living and housing. Con: More stress and longer hours, may not get as much little one time, comparable local jobs pay may not be ample for one income, loss of pension and fed benefits

Trying to figure out what is best for my family. Has anyone been in a similar boat and what did you decide?

personalfinance,1gnidao,Did I screw up? 3 Jobs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gnidao/did_i_screw_up_3_jobs/,7,I’m a college student trying to save up as much money as possible. I’m worried about taxes. Before going back to school in January. I have a job in housekeeping I got in June. I still have this job. I only work the weekends. The second job is seasonal I recently got hired and haven’t got a pay check yet. But I’m worried I won’t have enough money for college. So I decided to schedule another interview in retail for this Monday. This job is also seasonal the manager said I might only have to work 4 hours per week or little bit more since people have been trying to get as much hours. Both my housekeeping and second job I clicked the 2 job option when filling out how much taxes they should take out. When filling out the second job they said they were going to take up to 350 dollars out of every check I get from the second job. (When the taxes ask if I have a second job or multiple jobs or the second job makes more than half of my highest job) Is it worth it having a third job. I’m kind of freaking out and it would be nice to have some feedback. I’m trying to keep it as simple as possible but if there’s any questions.,2024-11-09 19:52:50
personalfinance,1gn5mfl,Budget for building a house,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gn5mfl/budget_for_building_a_house/,8,"Disclaimer: I live in Japan so some important factors will differ like the cost of living or the housing market situation in general but I'll try to explain where needed. Basically what I want to understand is if my budget is within my means. I'll give some numbers in US$.

Personal info: My annual salary is about 105000$. I have about 216000$ in cash, about 20000$ in a 401k a few thousand in crypto. Plus an old car back home that will appreciate by the time I retire, I assume around 20000$. For reference the average salary in Japan is 39000$. I'm 39 years old and we might have a kid next year. It's not certain because of fertility issues. With my current lifestyle which I plan not to change I save around 32000$ a year. An additional 4000$ goes in the 401k. I usually get a 2-3% raise every year. I work for a big Japanese company. Labor rights in Japan are quite strong and layoffs are a very rare thing here. I'd say my job is quite secure.

I'm considering taking a 680000$ loan to build a house in Tokyo. The value of the plots I'm looking at at the moment is between 360000-390000$. The building will cost around 290000$. I will receive 20000$ back from the government for meeting energy efficiency requirements once the house is complete. I am considering getting a 0 downpayment 35 year loan on a 0.6% variable rate and investing most of my cash. 

The land will most likely maintain its value or appreciate a little. The building will lose half its value in 10 years guaranteed. That's the housing situation in Japan. Depending on my finances in the future we might live in this house forever or sell it and buy one of those dirt cheap Japanese houses in the countryside and retire in our 50s if our finances allow that.

My partner is making 46000$ a year and we are sharing expenses but the mortgage will be under my name and I'll probably cover most of it. My portion of the rent right now is 720$ and the portion of the mortgage will be 1110$

personalfinance,1gn8cui,"Advice welcome, is this enough?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gn8cui/advice_welcome_is_this_enough/,4,"Hello, hoping for some advice on the system I have going right now: 

Some background info: I am an RN, I make around 80k salary. I have a state pension retirement plan, I plan to be with this employers thru retirement. 

-Pension- valued at around $50,000, I’m vested, making employer match 

-Roth IRA- currently at $24,000 in VFFVX, auto depositing $200 a month and then lump sums randomly throughout the year to max out. Maxed out the last few years, will plan to max out every year. Only issue currently is I’m saving for my wedding so extra $ is going to wedding fund.

-Brokerage account- $15,700 currently in VTSAX, auto depositing $200 a month. I usually don’t add any more than this because any extra goes toward IRA or right now- wedding fund. 

-$10,000 emergency fund in a savings connected to my checking. It isn’t high yield and I know that is dumb, but I can immediately transfer $ if I need it, I’m planning to switch this up though soon.

-High yield savings: I have a HYSA that is holding my wedding $. Once the wedding is over, I think I will move most of my emergency fund $ here and only keep maybe 2-5k in the regular savings linked to my checking. 

-No major debt. I pay off my credit card, paid off my car, no student loans, etc. 

I am trying to follow the boglehead method and just chill. Is this passive way enough to get to retirement? Anything you would change? Thank you! Also I’m 30 years old! ",2024-11-09 11:45:23
personalfinance,1gn86ct,Received an email about fraudulent transactions from my bank account.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gn86ct/received_an_email_about_fraudulent_transactions/,43,"So, for context, I receive email notifications whenever a transaction is made from my card. I also have a monthly subscription service for about $20 a month. Over the past few days I have been incredibly busy and wasn't really monitoring what I was spending.

So, when that subscription came around, it didn't go through. I guess they decided to charge me two more times, and I then received a notification, from a different email address, about the fraudulent transactions made from my account. They stopped all three transactions (apparently) and stated to call a specific number and verify my Case ID (a number they had in the email) to verify the transactions. The email also included my name and the last four digits of my debit card.

It's the weekend, and my bank has no after hours services. I don't know if my card is locked, but I need to use it before Monday. The number on the back of my card is only used to activate or report lost or stolen cards, not for any other services. The number included in the email is not found anywhere on my bank's website, but the website itself isn't the easiest to navigate. I had checked my account and did not see any attempted transactions, but if this email is legitimate, then I guess they wouldn't have been attempted to be made.

From my research, the number they gave me has been mentioned throughout various Reddit posts and is apparently the fraud department for a lot of smaller scale banks and credit unions, likely outsourced. It would make sense why my bank would use it, but I honestly have no real way of verifying if the email or phone number is legitimate. I haven't received a text or a phone call, just the email.

Does anyone have any advice as to how I proceed with this? Is there any way I can verify if my card is indeed locked?


Giving an update to the situation:

A couple of hours after I made this post, I received a text message from a 5 digit number which included my bank name, the last four numbers of my card, the attempted transaction from my subscription service, and the request of me responding ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the transaction. There were no links or requests for personal information, and I have not responded to the text message.

Just now, five hours after making the post, I received a phone call that my cell service provider immediately blocked as a Spam call. An automated voicemail was left, claiming to be from my bank's fraud department, which is something I have not been able to verify the existence of just yet, stating that a temporary hold might have been placed on my card and to call back at the phone number that was listed in the email and to enter the Case ID number that was also in the email. I have not called this number back.

I will attempt to use my card at an ATM today to withdraw some money to get me through the weekend until Tuesday when my bank opens up, and then I will try to contact them directly. The number on the back of my card went to a completely automated service to which my only options were to report my card as lost or stolen, so I was unable to verify if my card is active or reach any sort of assistance for a fraud department.",2024-11-09 11:33:36

I currently own an apartment in the UK. Due to the high maintenence costs of the building in which I live I am planning to sell this apartment before I leave, rather than keep it and rent it out. After selling I will have approximately £200k - £250k. I am not planning to invest this money in Japan, as i would like to keep my financial interests spread across the 2 countries. 

I am trying to decide what would be the best way to invest that money. Would it be better to buy a different property in the UK and rent it out? I am not sure about this option due to incoming changes to landlord regulations under the new Labour government. Or invest it in the stock market, and make money off stock growth/annual dividends? Or if there are any other options please feel free to suggest them.

The fund is TWCUX (Ultrafund) which is a growth fund that is pretty close to an average growth SP500.

It’s currently at 700,000.

I haven’t touched it.. but with my age allowing for 30-40 years of more growth, the 0.91% expense ratio irks me. I’m paying almost $7,000 for a fund to copy the sp500? I might as well go into FBGRX or VOOG.

I also loathe the brokerage interface and how no budget apps recognize the brokerage.

If I wanted to transfer the asset into Fidelity or Vanguard, do I have to sell it? Or should I just stop redistributions and feed that into the other two brokerages.

I’d be putting it into FXIAX/VFIAX or VOO.

Question I had was - my understanding is any report of theft, regardless of how soon the recovery was, will eventually show up in the carfax permanently and significantly reduce the resale value. Even if the car is recovered in perfect condition. Not aware of any way to get rid of this marker.

First option: Would I recover the most value out of this situation by pushing the insurer to fully write off the car? 

Second option: Or would one typically get more value by making any necessary repairs (which would be covered by insurance) and then re-selling the car after?

Third option: Similar approach as the second option, but would I get more value out of the recovered car by quickly trading it in to a dealership before the carfax is updated with any indication of theft?

Recently a job opportunity came up (same company, same role, same pay, benefits etc.) in a city that would put me much closer to home. (1 hour vs 9 hours). The cost of living and housing in general is also much lower than Southern California. For reference, most homes (new & older) in this city are selling between the low 400’s to low 600’s. 


I’ve been pondering the idea of selling my home in Southern California in order to purchase a home outright in cash in this new city. The thought of no longer having a mortgage payment (or a very small one) sounds amazing. However, knowing that I will also probably never see a mortgage rate of 2.875, causes me to reconsider that idea. Any thoughts?

Next year, I will be on an HDHP, and I intend to fund the associated HSA. Will I need to call the company that holds my FSA account to have them completely *close* this account before 2024 is over, in order to be eligible to fund the HSA in 2025? Or will I be eligible simply by carrying over $0 in the FSA, and not electing to make 2025 FSA contributions with my benefits?

While I do want to go to school I’m still undecided as to what to do.

My parents have been asking me what ID like to do with it, if I should leave it with them or if I want to use it to invest in a new car, home etc. They have a small portion of it in a bank long term savings account intended for school, I think there is perks with that account that the bank will give me a college grant in addition once I go to school, but there’s also a limit I think it needs to be withdrawn before I hit a certain age- still need to speak to the bank on those specifics. 

As for the majority of the fund, my parents are hardcore conspiracy theorists so they panicked thinking martial law was about to be enacted (???) and took all the money out and bought gold and silver with it… Not the worst thing they could’ve done with it but still kind of concerning.

For a while I’ve just been leaving it with them, but I’ve been debating taking it all and putting it into my TFSA until I commit to college. My TFSA has about $1500 and has grown by nearly 15% over the last year. (I know that’s not what the average percent is gonna end up being long term lol) I also have an additional 6k in savings and am selling my vehicle which should add ~10k on top of that.

My stepmom says if we don’t go to school they might just keep the money for themself for retirement. I’m really not sure what the best thing to do here and they don’t really know or care either. I’m just slightly concerned because they are conspiracy theorists that they might do something actually stupid, or that there’s a way I could better use it to grow while I figure out the college situation.

For example:

Let’s assume 24% tax rate and $0 OOP medical expenses such that the HSA is essentially used as a tax-advantaged investment account.

spouse1: has HMO through own employer

spouse2: has HDHP through own employer with the below contribution and premium options.


* Employee-only: $4300 contribution limit, $1250 employer contribution (“free money”), $0 premium

Net tax saving less premium: $1250 + $4300*(.24 + .0855) = $2650

* Employee+Spouse: $8550 contribution limit, $2500 employer contribution (“free money”), $2886 premium

Net tax saving less premium: $2500 + $8550*(.24 + .0855) - $2886 = $2397


Since $2650 >  $2397, is it better for spouse2 to simply elect for employee-only HDHP coverage? 

Or does the additional $8550 - $4300 = $4250 in family-limit contributions that could grow tax free through index fund investments make it worth paying the employee+spouse premium?

I’m a 22 year old that’s looking to pay off $7000 worth of credit card debt. I’m currently a full time student that takes demanding coursework and I work two jobs for an average of $1600/month. My rent is typically $658 and utilities are $70-100/month. Prior to getting my second job, I was struggling financially and couldn’t make the minimum payments on some credit cards causing them to be late, and my credit dropped over 100 points. With the increase in income I’m definitely going to prioritize getting back to current with these cards.

The one thing I’m trying to figure out though is if it makes sense to try and pay 7k down by May with the income and expenses I have currently bc I’d like to gift myself no CC debt as a graduation gift. I have a full time job offer where my net biweekly income will shoot up to $2500 plus a sign on bonus of the same amount, so I don’t want to put myself through the unneeded stress of trying to pay down 7k if within 6 months, I’ll be able to pay off all the debt easily while having the same amount of expenses since I’ll be moving back in with my mom and helping her a little bit with bills. The only thing that worries me is that I’ll be paying more in interest due to that 6 month stretch, and eventually I’ll have to pay 27k in student loans as well. 

So, I’m looking to gain a little more insight on how to decide between building up my savings during these next six months while just paying the minimum payments or barely scraping by and pushing to aggressively pay off my debts. Thank you!",2024-11-09 01:24:02

At this point in my life I want to take responsibility and get rid of my credit card debts and work on my personal finances to help my parents and family not struggle so much. 

So to explain, I have about $8,000 in cc debt spread across 5 cards. 3 of them I have maxed out at their limits ranging from $1500 to $3500, and the last 2 are not maxed out, with limits of $300 and $500. Credit score 650\~ ish. Personal income is really fluctuating, my current job has super inconsistent hours so weekly I can be paid anywhere from $100 to $350, though I am looking for different employment that would at least pay $350 weekly consistently. Rent+ other living expenses is very cheap at $150 a week due to living with family. 

I have a free account with experian and from what I can tell my best offer is a loan with Best Egg of $7200 with a deposit amount of $6500, and monthly payments of $300. But this isn't really ideal for me because it still doesn't cover my 3 most expensive cards, and i would still be making the payments on the leftover one, plus the last 2 cards, so at least for a while my monthly payments would increase from $305 a month to $380\~$400. 

I guess what i'd like to ask is if anyone has any recommendations for loans that would cover at least the 3 big debts at a lower monthly rate, or any credit cards that would allow me to do 3-5 balance transfers with good APR? The last 2 things I should mention are that I actually wouldn't even take out the loan until I *have* secured a job with better pay, so this is all future hypothetical talk, and also that a debt settlement is off the table, I signed up with Freedom Debt Relief but realized a few days in it just wouldn't work out for me with creditors constantly calling and negotiations for the bigger cards not starting until waaaay down the line.

Fidelity says it can be done but to consult an accountant. My experience with accountants is that most will give you the easy answer rather than the right answer, and hiring a tax attorney for this question isn’t worth the effort. So, Reddit it is! If you reply, please cite an authoritative source (preferably the IRC).

Okay, scenario: 
Suppose that I am employed by a company offering a 401(k) and make enough money that IRA contributions are not deductible for me. Now, suppose I open a Traditional IRA at a brokerage in order to at least benefit from the deferral of taxes on the gains.
Finally, suppose my employer modified their plan to allow after tax 401(k) contributions (a la mega backdoor Roths) and that the plan generally allows reverse rollovers.

Am I allowed (according to the IRS) to perform a reverse rollover and move the funds from the IRA to the 401(k)? In principle it seems plausible. The IRA contains two buckets of funds: one is already taxed (the contributions) and the other is tax deferred (the gains). This maps directly to an after tax contribution and a pretax contribution bucket in the 401(k), so reporting the basis and paying appropriate taxes when the time comes seem entirely doable.

The IRS chart (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) doesn’t include an entry for traditional IRAs with non-deductible contributions. The only authority I could find is 26 USC 408(d)(3)(A)(ii) but it’s not clear exactly how that would apply here.",2024-11-09 02:59:24

(leaky pipes to upstairs, AC doesn't work, drywall that got damaged before the roof got fixed.)

I am about 98% certain the mortgage on the house is paid off. Can you even get a home equity loan without a mortgage?

My uncle is willing to do a nominal cost sale of the house to me, but I don't have the money to pay the currently owed property taxes and do all the repairs. (I haven't looked up what the minimum sale price for the county and state is yet. My uncle bought the house from a family friend, and that friend bought the house from their parents for $0 in 1982, so it's possible the minimum sale price is $0 at least when selling to family members.) If I buy the house, would I be able to get a home equity loan, and if so, would that make sense to get the property taxes caught up and repairs done, or is there some other option that would be better?

There's no chance I'd qualify for a loan without collateral. My credit isn't great right now thanks to a long unemployment and a divorce, and my income doesn't look good on paper because I've recently started a personal business. I've done a budget and know what I could afford to pay on a loan while paying utilities, property taxes, groceries, and other crucial expenses based on what I am consistently making the last few months, but I don't have a very long income history to prove this to a bank.

I feel like a home equity loan would be a better option than a HELOC because I could put the money in the bank as a cushion to repay the loan itself, and wouldn't have to worry about a balloon payment or changing interest rate.

I got a job recently and it comes with either Pretax or Roth retirement and I selected Roth. I have been actively doing backdoor Roth for my IRA over the last few years. After putting aside 4-5 months of expenses as savings, I will still have $10k money to put towards retirement or Roth backdoor. Also, getting around $5-8k in inheritance before end of year. 

My total tax burden barely makes it into the 12% bracket and I am trying to decide where I should max my Roth retirement, fill Roth IRA or backdoor Roth. As I understand, I can contribute to my Roth IRA until early next year as well. What the optimal way to get most bang for my buck?

1. Enough Roth 401k to get matching, backdoor as much Roth IRA as I can and fill Roth IRA early next year

2. Use extra $10k savings towards bills and max Roth 401k using salary, max Roth IRA before Mar 2025 deadline, and use any remaining funds towards Roth backdoor.

  
The 4-5months savings will be untouched and I will use the $10k to either fund the Roth IRA/Roth backdoor or to pay bills and use salary towards Roth 401k.",2024-11-08 22:27:30

Hey yall,

Looking for some feedback on my situation. Please don’t be too mean. I understand I borrowed from my future and accept the responsibility of paying this off. 

I have a lot of debt. Some of it is from floating myself through un and underemployment. Some is just dumb debt. I am determined for it not to be death debt, however. I am in a place now where I make good, steady money and have solid employment. I am not using my cards anymore and want to have a fixed payment amount and exact payoff date. I am considering consolidating my credit card debt to a personal loan for a lower interest rate and set payments. Is this a bad idea? Is there a better alternative that isn’t bankruptcy? 

Here’s my breakdown: 

Income: $5,164.19/month 
Living Expenses: $2,441.35/month
Minimum Debt Payments: $1,936.27/month 


For more of a breakdown on the debt:
Personal Loan 1: $658.27/mo | 11.34% APR | 10/26 payoff date 

Personal Loan 2: $420/mo | 16.97% APR | 5/26 payoff date 


Card 1: $500 min payment | 29.49% APR | $14,581.33 balance

Card 2: $308 min payment | 26.74% APR | $9,388.35 balance

Card 3: $50 min payment | 19.99% APR | $719.29 balance

The APR went up on each of my cards and a couple of months ago and I don’t know why. I  am not close to my limit on any of them and now it’s so high that the interest charge is eating up progress I was making. I am not behind on any payments I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel for the cards like I do for the personal loans and I gotta fix that. 

I got an offer from the place that holds my 11% APR Personal loan for another low interest loan and I’m considering that. Is that a bad idea? Is there anything else I should consider? I do plan on getting a second job but I gotta get this part decided first. 

I could also use some inspiring comeback stories if you were also able to dig yourself out of such a hole. Thanks, yall! ",2024-11-09 01:49:55

I just started working my jobs after graduating earlier this year. Single income. 

Here’s my stats: 

First job: 105k income, by end of next year I will get a raise to 112k. The raises are guaranteed by years of experience, not performance. pension begins after 5 years of work. I work for 180 days out of the year, still get paid during the time I’m not working. Health insurance and all. 

Second job: $73/hour, no benefits. - I work here on my own choosing on my day offs, can work as much as I choose, plan to do so when I’m off from my first job. At minimum I may make about 20k or so extra. 

After a couple months of work, I see that post tax I average about 9k per month. 

Assets: 
16k Roth IRA (hope to max it out by end of this year) 

High yield savings: 12k 

Debts: 

Student loans: at 55k, payments start soon. I imagine my monthly will be about $600 or so. Average interest 5.5%, all federal unsubsidized grad loans.

Car: 
Owe 3k left, 2.87% interest, monthly payments $270. 

I’m on the west coast and currently home interest rates are average 6% sadly. Is it possible to make the goal of buying a house in 2 years? What’s the best way to tackle this with my current situation? How much is a comfy amount to have saved in the bank if the homes I wanted to buy are in the 400k range?

I’ll be 30 in 2025. 

I make 100K a year (before taxes of course, about 67k actually in my pocket post taxes and pension). 

Currently, I have 25K in stocks, 8k in a maxed for 2024 roth IRA I recently started, and about 10K in savings (I recently decided to pay off my student loans in bulk). 

I’m tempted to sell all my stocks and transfer that to my savings, as my partner and I are thinking of buying a house and we said we would both save 50K (for a total of 100K) for the down payment. If I do this, I will easily reach this 50K goal by the end of 2025. 

The reasons I’m tempted to do this is because: 

1. I feel like 25K is not life changing money, and if I keep it, I don’t really plan on adding a lot more to it. Projections, and by that I mean a quick google search, say that in 20 years this will be worth $100-116K. 

2. If I sell it all, then this will help me get to the 50K goal quickly, and also allow me to start an emergency fund (that is, one that is explicitly an emergency fund, right now I just use my savings if needed). 

3. This will also allow me to continue maxing out my roth ira each year, as reaching the 50k goal will make me not feel like i need to save as much. Recently I was trying to save 2K a month, and due to some changes now the most that I’ll be able to save is 1.5k a month. With this, I can put 500-600 a month in the roth and save the other 900-1000 without worrying about whether or not I am saving enough because I am really close to the 50K goal. 

4. Of course one con is paying taxes on my stocks gains if I do sell them. 

I’m typing this on my phone so it probably isn’t as best written as it could have been, but any advice would be appreciated. ",2024-11-08 17:29:32

I believe her goals are low to moderate risk for the money until she passes, and then obviously it will fall on the beneficiaries and myself to figure out what happens after. She is in her mid-70s with no significant ailments or health issues, super active and sharp so I feel she can easily live another 20+ years. So with that, we would be looking at a long term investment approach. 

Anyone have any recommendations on brokerage accounts or financial firms that are highly recommended and reliable/trustworthy? Or even just ideas of ways to invest outside of what is commonly known. 

Just looking to brainstorm and gather ideas to do research. Thanks!",2024-11-08 23:17:00

$3,100 on a credit card (used to cover moving fees a few months ago, making payments on time from paycheck. Would like to pay off.)
$1,300 worth of repairs on my current car (might be able to get this down a good $300 if I can do some of the work myself.)
And some small, miscellaneous fees for a new apartment I’m moving into. Think Uhaul, mattress bags, gas for said Uhaul, copies of keys, etc.

I'm reaching out because I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with my debt situation and I really don't know what to do. I’ve accumulated a significant amount of payday loan debt and cash advances, and right now, I feel like I'm in a black hole.

I enrolled in a debt consolidation program, but I'm facing some serious challenges. I can't even make my first payment because I’m late on my auto loan, and I think I need to prioritize that first. The debt consolidation company has warned me that if I miss even one payment, they might close my account, and if my debt goes to collections, they may not be able to help me anymore.

My credit is already in terrible shape, and I'm feeling hopeless. I just switched my direct deposit to a different bank to try to protect my paycheck, but I'm really confused about who I should pay first.

If we are both at BoA and we’ve sent payments back and forth via the the “transfer” section that uses Zelle for other banks / uses BoA for same bank clients…

Can they just send it back to me this weekend? Since I believe same bank transfers is different than zelle, I’m not sure there’s any limitations / daily amounts restricted. 

Is it better to have a check with a memo that says “loan repayment” or does it not matter?

There’s no profit in this transaction. Just getting the exact amount back. No interest etc. Do I need to inform bank or notate anything on taxes? Again, just receiving my own money back. 

Just want to make sure I don’t cause any false alerts or issues, just looking to receive my original amount back via zelle / same bank transfer (not sure it uses the Zelle system). I’ve always seen things that say $10,000 is like a checkpoint for transactions that get “flagged”. 

The family member asked me if I wanted $5K sent 3x. I immediately said no, as that’s weird and unintended “structuring”.

Just the wife and I, early 40s, no kids. We plan to buy in about 15 years so current market considerations aren't really that important. I'm more interested in optimizing taxes so that we'll be able to outright purchase the home.

Our long term plan is to liquidate our investments to purchase a home outright. No mortgage. I want to ask if there's a better strategic way to go about this other than what I'm thinking below. So, here's the meat:

Combined pensions with annual COL increases - $175K - Only $115K is taxable  
Taxable Account - All in SWTSX (Similar to VTSAX) - $10M  
Roth IRA - $800K

If we find a home for say, $8M, what's the best way of liquidating our taxable account in order to outright purchase the home?

If we liquidate $8M in 1 sale (all long term gains), we end up paying around $1.5M in taxes ($7.5M of that is at 20% CG).

Alternatively, if we withdraw $500K each year to stay in the 15% bracket and put it in a HYSA, it'd take longer and our income taxes would increase from the earned interest as the HYSA grows. edit: I ran the numbers and this slow method is no good.

I used these 2 sites to help me along. Both were saved from other posters on this sub:

[Tax Bracket Calculator](https://engaging-data.com/tax-brackets/?fs=1&reg=0&cg=100000) and [Investment Snowball Calculator](https://www.cecuonline.org/Resources/Calculators/Compound-Savings-Calculator)

personalfinance,1gmtk4h,How much chasing of APY rates makes sense?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmtk4h/how_much_chasing_of_apy_rates_makes_sense/,19,"We have the majority of our extra money at Ally's HYSA for 4% APY (we have had various CD ladders there, but the rates have fallen so much, 3.9% for an 18 mos., 4.1% for a 12 mos., 4.2% for 9 mos., 4.3% for a 6 mos.). Overall I know rates are coming down everywhere, partly because of the Federal Reserve lowering rates.

A podcast I listen to, Faith & Finance (FaithFi) was discussing a Christian credit union (mycccu.com) and how their profits go to support Christian ministries. I prefer to directly donate money to organizations, but figured I'd check out their rates. The HYSA is 5% APY for up to $5K; and 4% APY in checking for up to $5K. I was thinking my wife could open a HYSA, and that's roughly half our our 6 mos. Emergency Fund (EF) accounted for. We'd just keep the rest at Ally's HYSA at 4% and keep shopping the CD rates when they are attractive.

We're discussing is this worth the hassles for an extra 1% APY? It there wasn't a tiered limit of only $5K, I'd say yes. But having to have a second account, and still not being able to keep all of our EF, I'm kinda of like, ""Meh"".

Thoughts about how and when chasing APY rates makes sense? I don''t/won't do things with gimmicks like ""X amount of debit card purchases"" - I don't mind the checking having a $500/month minimum deposit as we'd likely just change the majority of our direct deposit over to this, except for a small amount (say $400) still going to our local Credit Union to keep that account free and where we'd typically pull ATM cash out.

One ""task"" I'd have with the CCCU HYSA is to transfer the amounts over $5K out of those HYSA accounts to the checking account or Ally's HYSA so they'll get the better rates. The $5K-$10K tier at CCCU drops to half of the first tier (so 2.5% APY now).",2024-11-08 21:25:52

I bought a townhouse in 2021, and bought a dodge challenger in 2020 in the height of COVID. So, I damn near stole that thing off the lot. My pre upgrade income paid for both without issue and have been putting money away on top for years. Zero other debt. So, I will have significant additional income. 

I have been tossing around the idea of trading or adding a car to my life. I live in the Midwest where snow is prevalent. Lots of it… My challenger is a rear wheel drive car which I absolutely love. I owe like, $8,000 on it. But obviously not smart to have when getting 10+ inches of snow at a time sometimes. 

Do I:

A: pay it off ASAP, keep it, and buy a new (not new new 2020~) SUV for a practical daily car and keep my challenger as a “fun” car? I’d get a standard auto loan from my credit union. 

B: trade it in ASAP, use the equity to buy a SUV (2019~), pay that off ASAP. Also more than likely get a loan for the remaining balance on said new car. Then, put money away for a while to buy a new “fun” car in the future?

C: Keep making my minimum payments on the challenger (at 2% interest), and buy a practical SUV as well (2015~) and just eat the dual payment for a while? 

I have no problem having a car payment. I thoroughly enjoy having a fun car, but I think it’s time to move into the part of my life that includes having a practical car as well, or instead, until another time.

* I made non-deductible Traditional IRA contributions of $6,000 in 2021 and 2022. The current balance is $11,000 (invested in BND), showing a loss.
* Besides this IRA, I have a taxable brokerage, 403(b), 457(b), DCP, and an inherited IRA. I previously had a SEP IRA, which was rolled into my 403(b) a few years ago when I thought I would convert to a ROTH.
* My husband has a Traditional and a Rollover IRA, and I want to confirm whether his accounts will affect my pro-rata considerations.
* Our AGI is below $230,000 this year, so we qualify for Roth contributions.

Looking for advice on debt pay down. I have been fortunate enough to save up about 50k in order to pay down debt.

My original plan was to throw it all at my roughly 82k student loan balance which would basically keep my payments at $180 perpetually, and I could throw extra money at it as I see fit in the future. To note, current payments are $340 on PAYE, but my income this is based off of was in 2020. Also consider the student loans are basically 6% effective interest rate. 

The major problem I am trying to avoid here is that after I need to recertify my income, Income based payments are no longer going to make sense (payments will jump significantly 3/4x). Consolidating current loans with no pay down,  on a standard repayment plan, increases payments for 20 years to $492. But total amount paid considering interest would be $177,283. I generally hate this option but it’s more for context on what my options are if I didn’t deal with this large loan balance.

Here is my decision paralysis, 50k is obviously a lot of money, I have goals of upgrading my home, saving for my daughters college, etc.
Does my plan make sense when I can consider following alternatives:

Payoff loan on truck $16k (2%) interest: would remove a $440 payment 

Payoff motorcycle loan 5.5k (8% interest): would remove $225 payment 

Keeping money invested and drip feed the higher payments

Honestly I think my plan is the best one, but I get really stuck somewhere in opportunity cost of throwing this money at debt, or whether there is a better way to thread the needle in payoff the vehicles and a smaller portion of the loans to get to a more happy medium. Like basically there’s more bang for my buck in cash flow going after the vehicles first.

Given this situation, what would you do? I also want to say I am fully aware I have “good problems”. So please just looking for objectivity here.",2024-11-08 20:31:02

I've been investing since 2017. Mix of index and individual stock. My returns have been decent, basically market average despite some dumb dumb picks and solid winners. 

With the S&P hitting basically 6000, I'm realizing I'm at a point where I can make a significant dent in my mortgage. Essentially an 80% reduction. 

I'm torn between the correct financial decision and the mental health decision. I would be essentially liquidating my TFSA (Roth IRA equivalent) to do this. However my RRSP (401k) would remain intact. I'm aware that generally speaking, market returns will out do saved interest by paying down mortgage. But the S&P has printed ~35% YTD which is substantial for something that averages 8-10%.

My objective as an investor has always been growing dividends to create a portfolio that would fund retirement, with a side of growth. But these unrealized paper gains I used to ignore have now changed to something of real material substance. And I don't know what to do. 😕

Again, I understand that in theory maintaining the portfolio is the optimal finanacial choice. But having a nearly paid off house, regardless of what the future holds sounds pretty dope. Lose job? Oh well. Can't get back in tech? I'll probably be fine. Market dies? Don't care. 😅

We took out a $100,000 loan from my father at 2% interest to pay for her school. He has told us there is no rush to pay it back but with the interest and advice from Dave Ramsey on family loans, it has made me inclined to prioritize that before saving for a house. However, with such a low interest rate it also makes me think about investing some money to use for a down payment later. 

  
I also would like to get started on raising a family, we have no family nearby to help so this would mean a period of time where my wife is not working and then potentially returning part-time which would decrease our ability to pay down the loan.

I have 45k in my retirement account and almost no credit card debt. I am working on purchasing a house and will have a 1400 dollar a month mortgage payment on a fixer upper. 

Should I be using the 22k for home improvements on my fixer upper or should I be investing all of it into a portfolio that I currently do not have. Meaning I have almost no investments o it side of my 401k and an account with maybe ~8-10k in it from 2020 that is invested in Apple, Tesla, and Disney stock. 

Help!

36M in TN. I just paid off my '14 Ford Focus with 100,000 miles. It needs about $3,000 in repairs per dealership, I would take it to a different (i.e. cheaper) mechanic.

The [30-Day Challenge #11](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gh4s5b/30day_challenge_11_audit_your_insurance_coverage/) seems like a good way to save money by auditing insurance coverage. 

Herein lies my dilemma: Do I keep my collision/comprehensive coverage or drop to liability?
I have very low risk tolerance. I wouldn't be able to afford a new (to me) car, and I could only get financing through a predatory lender. I can pay the deductibles for collision/comprehensive.

My current policy is with Progressive (bundled with renters):

$95/month + $17/month renters

BI/PD 50/100/25

UM BI: 50/100

UM PD: 25

Comprehensive: $1,000 deductible

Collision: $1,000 deductible

I've tried getting a quote from other companies, but for me, Progressive is always cheaper.

The new quote I looked at is:

$91/month or $77/month with the Snapshot device + $20/month renters

BI/PD: 100/300/100

UM BI: 25/50

UM PD: 25

Medical Payments: $2k per person

Roadside Assistance

I raised my BI/PD because of [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1giwnaa/is_it_worth_increasing_your_personal_poperty/). There are a ton of fancy cars on the road in my area. I don't think I make enough money for a lawsuit to go anywhere, but you never know. Also, is Snapshot from Progressive worth it. Is a risk of snapshot higher premiums?

The property itself is 0.25 acres (10,890sqft) in a desirable neighborhood. The land has been assessed just under $100,000, and the structures assessed at around $250,000. The taxable value is $140,000. I am unable to pay the property tax on the house which is due November 15th.

High-Deductible Plan: $1066 per year.

$1650 deductible. Almost everything is 10% coinsurance after deductible. Prescription drugs $5 after deductible.

From my perspective, the High Deductible Plan saves me $1066 vs. traditional PPO, and with company HSA contribution, that is an additional ~$600 post-tax.

I made a mistake and have been contributing to pre tax instead of Roth first in my plan. However, my plan offers the capabilities to convert pre tax dollars to Roth dollars with just a couple clicks.

I personally think tax rates right now are pretty good, and that in 30 years it’ll likely be higher, so I want to pay taxes on them now. 

Three questions:

1. Are my calculations correct on how much taxes I pay if I convert to Roth?

2. I’m assuming taxes in the future are likely to be higher considering our taxes compared to back then are pretty good, is that an appropriate assumption to make?

3. My company plan’s footnotes mention that: if any of the money I had is in company stock I could get special tax treatment, what’s that about? I tried google and didn’t find anything.

Some background on me, late 20’s with very low monthly expenses due to having car paid off and living at home. This is only referring to my individual brokerage, I have 401(k) and Roth IRA that are funded to my satisfaction.

My portfolio is as follows:

Total Balance: $76,228.98

ABNDX - $1,138.71 (total loss $169.04)

SGENX - $9,175.19 (total gain $4215.27)
SMCWX - $5,625.40 (total gain $1446.15)

All have unrealized capital gains, both short and long term due to reinvestment, except ABNDX has an unrealized loss. I know selling for gains will equal taxes, both short term and long term.

- Is it smart to just sell all positions and reinvest with total balance?
- Is it smart to do avg cost or FIFO?
- Should I only sell long term gains, and hold short term until they become long term?
- should i sell some in 2024 and some in 2025, or all in one year or the other?

I am trying to breakdown budgets for my wife and I, and figure out when it makes sense, or if it makes sense within the next year, to purchase a home.

Home area we are looking at is Vancouver, WA.

Home price: \~500,000

Salary is currently $175,000 combined a year

If we move to Vancouver, WA, I won't take a salary hit as I work remote, but we have the potential to lose about $15,000 yearly for my wife as we are moving from CA to WA. Meaning about the worst case scenario is we move and we now have a salary at $160,000. (obviously worst case is she doesn't have any job, but we wouldn't move if she didn't even have remote work lined up in the interim).

We currently rent and pay $1990 in a 2bed/1bath apartment.

Debt is $720/month for a car, 2.5 years in the 6 year payment.

Our monthly savings that goes into our HYSA is $3000.

Savings currently is $40,000.

I have used this link [https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/how-much-house-can-i-afford](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/how-much-house-can-i-afford) , and when I enter the information of a $40,000 down payment, 30 year loan, Excellent credit score (both of us have excellent credit scores), an annual income of $160,000 (taking the lower end of what a salary projection would be if we moved up there), the calculator says the max ""affordable"" is $4,066 mortgage, on a 521,571 house. If I drop it to \~500,000 house I get a mortgage of \~$3,896. This is about $1900 more then what we pay in rent; however we save $3000 a month so to me it seems to make sense that it would be affordable, even without putting 20% down.

I guess I am here to see if these numbers make sense, or if I am missing anything. This is also if our salaries stay stagnant, which I don't really see happening. I work as a software developer and am safe at my company, and she works as a social worker, and can transfer to WA without an issue.

I used $40,000 down payment as that is what we have now, but if we were consistent with $3000 a month, by next year we'd have another $36,000 in savings as our safety net.

The reason we'd want to not wait for 20% down payment is that my wife wants to start working from home, at least part time, and also needs an office, but a confidential one to provider therapy services. That can't happen at our current place, and I'm not trying to buy a house in Southern California.

Edit: Edited house price number from the link. Had incorrect details plugged in. They are now in line with actual projections.

Edit 2: Using the nytimes buy-rent-calculator I plugged in $500,000 home price, monthly rent of $3,000 (the lowest price for a 3 bedroom in my area currently), we plan to stay at least 20 years,.

I want someone who knows their shit to help me get a strategy together. I’m not looking to manage my expenses in a spreadsheet or use an app (yet).

What should I be looking for to find someone to fit this need? Do I just need a CPA? An actual financial advisor? I don’t think I need to meet with them regularly unless I start to make more money or own property or something.

personalfinance,1gmob3z,Seeking advice on what to do with recent inheritance and existing assets,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmob3z/seeking_advice_on_what_to_do_with_recent/,0,"Hi all,  
For reference, I'm in my mid 30s and live in the US. I believe I'm responsible with my finances but I am behind in knowing how to work with what I have and what kind of resources/opportunities are out there. I'm now in a position to make a serious effort to build my financial health and potential but need some guidance.

Income: my Salary is \~$80,000 in a MCOL area; wife's salary is $92,000. We have no investments outside of our retirement funds.

We have a 30 year mortgage for a house we bought 4-5 years ago. Existing amount =195k with a 3.8% interest rate. No other properties and we have no children (this may change in the near future). We pay $1505.00 towards the mortgage monthly.

My personal assets:  
\-Around $58,000 USD between checking and savings accounts between two banks  
\-I recently inherited $100,000 that I just deposited into one of my savings accounts (still processing)  
\-403b is currently at $63,000; I put in 7% of my bi-weekly pay and my employer contributes 3% and a quarterly 1% bonus. I am planning on increasing my contribution to 10% soon.  
\-No other personal retirement accounts and as mentioned above, no investments  
\-Total cash assets that I can work with = 158k; will likely keep 10-15k in an emergency fund

Liabilities:  
\-As above, existing mortgage is 195k with 3.8% interest. Monthly payment is $1505.00. Wife and I split monthly mortgage half and half. The house is in good shape but could use some updating; however, this is not an immediate priority  
\-Car Loan: existing $5,150 at a 3.99% interest rate; I pay $296 a month.  
\-Student Loans: $60k all federal. I am on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan and met the required 10 years of public service for complete forgiveness. I should have had my loans forgiven last month but there is a processing freeze due to current litigation that prevents my service and payments from being finalized. There is a potential for this to be drawn out for a year or more. However, with Trump winning the presidency, there is a very real chance that my loans may not be forgiven any time soon (or possibly not being forgiven at all). Because of this litigation, my loans are in administrative forbearance and I do not have to pay towards them currently.  
\-No credit card debt  
\-No other debts  
\-Total liabilities = \~$200,000 without counting my student loans

What steps would you recommend for me to optimize my financial health? Regarding my financial goals, I like the idea of  early retirement but the line of work I'm in will allow me to work well past the retirement age if I so choose. Fortunately, I like the career I'm in so I'm not ready to finalize a decision/path. Regarding the inheritance money, ideally, I'd like it to make money for me but I'm not sure how to proceed with that. I don't want high risk but I am not aware of safer investment options outside of a HYSA. Any thoughts, suggestions, or resources would be greatly appreciated.",2024-11-08 17:41:21
personalfinance,1gmo8yb,Trying to be financially responsible. Personal loan to pay off negative equity so I can sell vehicle? Would save $750 a month.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmo8yb/trying_to_be_financially_responsible_personal/,21,"Hi all. Over the last 6 months I’ve made real improvements on paying off debt and getting my shit together. 

Right now I’m in a situation where I have a $947 car payment that I just don’t want anymore. It was purchased in 2022 and car prices dropped a lot post pandemic, leaving me heavily upside down. I owe about $47k, and Carvana is offering $33k. Probably can get a few more private party but honestly just don’t want the hassle.

That’s about $14.5k negative equity. I was wondering what your thoughts were around taking out a personal loan to cover the negative equity so I can get rid of it. The personal loan would be around $340 a month at 12% APR through my credit union.. rates are crazy right now.

This would let me sell it and I’d be saving approximately $762 a month between car payment and insurance. Not to mention the $750 in renewal every year.

Thankfully we have a second older car that’s already paid off that we’d use as a replacement.

Zero interest for 12 months. The estimate is $3600–4500 and I'm assuming the worst. 

The other credit card debt I've been battling for awhile. It was at $9,000 and now down to $7200. It was a combination of unexpected car repairs and being only able to find underpaying positions for a year after grad school.

I now have a better paying job to where I've been able to start paying off the 9,000 (which is why it's at $7200 now), but this extra cost is going to hurt. I'm not sure off the top of my head what my APR is on the $7200 but it's high. My last interest charge was $178. 

My ideas knowing nothing about finance are bankruptcy or applying for college again (I'm also 90,000 in student debt 🙃) with the intention of just using that loan money to pay off the credit card debt. So that way it's in student loans as opposed to credit cards. 

I also am hoping to try to negotiate down the $7200. I've had that card for several years (though not with that high of balance) and have been overwhelmingly faithful in meeting the minimum monthly payments. But I'm not sure if a negotiated lower APR or even zero interest is going to help me and I'm not sure I can afford to pay even half of that in a lump sum up front. ",2024-11-08 17:22:58

I have a Vanguard brokerage account that I invested in 10 years ago based on advice I received. I did okay with it. I was honestly not educated in investing in this way at all and it was too risky for me - so I didn’t look further into it besides putting some money in the stocks below and never looking at it. Stocks I’m in are VUG, QQQ, SPY, VXF, AAPL. 

I recently found out about this group and I’m ready to rework my personal investments. 

I have $160k in Vanguard brokerage. $125k in an HYSA at 5.05%. I also have a rental condo that I plan to sell next year and may just add the earnings to the brokerage account too. $500k condo (200k equity, 120k mortgage left, rest is profit). 

I’m able to freely invest that money and am thinking something along the lines of keep $15k in HYSA. (I have another $20k in personal savings that doesn’t really get touched.) Put $270k in VTI/VXUS (80/20) and just let it sit until my husband retires. (15 or so years)

My questions are based on not knowing how to work the platform, sell my current shares, are fees involved?, how to avoid any costly mistakes when selling and reinvesting, making sure dividends are reinvested, etc…

1.) Can I use the brokerage account that I currently have for VTI/VXUS, VOO, etc.?

2.) Can I sell my current positions and buy new ones tax/free? 

3.) Is there a new predicted dip to wait for since the market is up quite a bit due to the election? Is it worth waiting for anything to go down or is it best to get money into VTI/VXUS right now due to the long term strategy? 

4.) Can someone kindly give me a step by step on how to sell my current positions and then reinvest? Basically a dummy proof version that can tell me? Otherwise kindly advise me where to go to find this info. 

5.) I’m open to any constructive criticisms/advice here, so feel free.

personalfinance,1gmggds,Budgeting app like Level Money back in the day,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmggds/budgeting_app_like_level_money_back_in_the_day/,3,Newly single mom here trying to keep a budget. Back in 2015 I had a really cool app called Level Money that took your monthly income and bills/expenses and gave you a daily allotment to spend—no categories—just how much you could spend each day without going over budget. It took into account your groceries and things like that so those didn’t count against your daily spending. It would adjust if you went over one day so the rest of the days would be less spending money. It would track your expenses for monthly data and also move the change over into your savings account if you wanted. Well apparently it shut down in 2017 and I’m hoping for a viable alternative and having trouble finding one. ,2024-11-08 11:33:07

I’m 43.  When I left my company a few years ago, I converted a pension into a rollover IRA. I am now trying to get rid of the rollover IRA by converting it into some other type of retirement account.  (The reason for this is I want to do a backdoor Roth IRA, using post-tax dollars, each year going forward - but doing so when also having my rollover IRA would result in a tax liability on the funds added to the backdoor Roth IRA, due to the IRA aggregation rule). 

I have an old 401k and a current 401k, but unfortunately neither plan allows me to bring in the rollover IRA funds into the 401k.

Is there anything else I can do to move the rollover IRA funds into some other type of retirement account (without getting taxed on the funds now), in order to be able to do the backdoor Roth IRA tax-free going forward?",2024-11-08 15:10:39

I currently have a modification of a three fund portfolio for my IRA, but I've kind of been wanting to divest from China.

As far as I can tell the best way to do this is basically drop VXUS (which I'm currently using) and replace it with EMXC plus some international developed fund like VEA and split my contributions that would have gone to VXUS between those two.

This sound about right? Is there a better way to handle this? Things I should be aware of before moving forward?

27yo 70k salary in VHCOL area.

Currently save 30% of my income pretax

401k: 26%

HSA: 4% 

Roth IRA: maxed for 2024

Total investments value: ~$200k

After taxes, retirement contributions, health insurance, other deductions I take home $2,800 per month. 

Had to move back to my parents in the suburbs recently due to roommates moving to other cities and getting laid off. Being at home with my parents is impacting my mental health negatively. Went from a wonderful walkable community with many friends nearby to my parents house in the suburbs requiring driving everywhere. Feeling isolated from friends. 

Before moving back home I saved only a little bit of money post tax. Total living expenses including rent, utilities, food, transportation was about ~$2k per month so I had ~$800 a month for having fun and other costs.

Trying to get back to the city but cheapest rents for studio or one bed I can find are all at least $500 more in rent than I used to pay. This time of year is also the absolute worst time to find an apartment in this city due to very low inventory. Friends who could be potential roommates have all been flaky (part of the reason I ended up moving home instead of getting a new apartment) I want to avoid living with randoms if possible. 

So should I save less to live more? Reduce 401k savings, move out to start living and enjoying life again. I’m leaning towards yes, but I have extreme anxiety about money and feeling like I have enough for the future and doing the things I want to do.",2024-11-08 20:59:08

* This is my first 'career' job 
*  ⁠I have a wide range of skills needed to do all the company needs from me
* ⁠I'm the only creative at my company and any designers here will know that means I have to do things beyond my job description (Web design, Social Media creatives, Animation and Motion design, Packaging design, copywriting, Logos and Brand identities for clients. Honestly the list goes on forever.) All things most places would have multiple employees for.
* ⁠I'm incredibly busy with a huge waiting list of work to complete.
* ⁠\*I'm on £28k salary.\*
* ⁠I also have to do Meta Ads and budgeting for them.
* ⁠I've been at the company for 1 year and 2 months.

I think thats all the info that could be needed, let me know if you want to know anything extra.

My question is, am I being underpaid? 

My company HEAVILY relies on me, there's 6 employees (approx.) and there's not a lot of work that comes into the company that doesn't end up on my desk as the only creative on the team. I got thrown super in the deep-end shortly after joining as nearly all the employees suddenly left (lots of drama) and my boss was relying on me to save his bacon with clients and step up to the plate, which I did.

I've asked my line-manager to consider a pay-rise and he arranged for a meeting in January to talk about it but from the way he was wording things (""New labour government is really hitting small-businesses hard"" etc. which I know isn't really anything to do with me and my work, his problem not mine) it doesn't sound like it's going to go great in this meeting for me.

I mostly enjoy my clients, I've worked with brands and companies not many people my age would've and I'm super grateful to my company for giving me these opportunities. However, at the same time I've played a major role in keeping this business afloat and it was my work that impressed these HUGE clients. I have this work under my belt and it will definitely help me find a new job if that's what I decide to do.

I know I'm doing ok for people my age and due to my partners job I'm by no means struggling, but I don't feel like thats a reason to provide cheap work for my boss and not strive for more. There's not many people in the industry that I believe can do the scope of skills that I bring to the business within one role.",2024-11-08 14:49:44

We recently paid off our mortgage in full. Our house is an average single-family home, no HOA or weird situations. We're single-income, about $96k/yr. Our house is worth at least $400k.

We want to move to a different neighborhood outside Minneapolis to be closer to work/school. There's a house we really like that costs $540k. We have just enough in savings/stocks for a 20% downpayment.

A relative is very interested in our house. They're only a few years into their current mortgage on an average income, so can't buy our house outright.

We and our relative would both like to be moved in to our new houses before selling our current houses.

With our mortgage officer, we tried out a couple financing options for the new house, using our current house as equity for a bridge loan/HELOC. All the options result in payments that are slightly above 50% of our income, so we can't quite make it work without the new mortgage being contingent on the sale of our current house. ""Someone is very interested in our house"" doesn't satisfy the bank, of course.

**Would it be possible** to set up a rent-to-own agreement with our relative and our current house, with the expectation that as soon as we're all moved we'll sell the house to them for the balance?

Looking to get a 529 started for my newborn and most likely going to use Vanguard as I already have an IRA with them. I've gathered that it's more beneficial for the 529 to not be opened by the parents because that would reduce FAFSA aid by over 5% since it's considered a parent asset on the aid application.

However, the grandparents are both 75+ in age so I'm wondering if it might make more sense to open it in my brother's name instead, since the grandparents may pass before the child is college-age.

My questions are:

-Does this make sense to do?

-Can we as the actual parents still easily contribute to the 529 regularly even though we would not be the account owners?

-Lastly, is there any kind of inconvenience on my brother's behalf if he were to be the account owner? Do we have to give him the money that we want contributed into the account? Does he have to report the account for tax purposes? 

He does have 2 kids of his own, but he only has UTMAs for his kids, he didn't opt for 529. Would the 529 in our kid's name end up affecting his kids' financial aid when they go to college?

I think with the new IRA rollover rule the 529 makes more sense than UTMA, but I'm trying to leverage it in the best way possible.

There is a family currently living in the bottom portion of the home, renting for $775 a month (underpriced but the owner isn't the type to gouge a single mother, neither are we). We would like to keep her as a tenant as we fix up the upstairs while living in it. However, the house is over 100 years old and isnt in the best shape, the owner was seemingly very transparent about the issues in the house such as minor leaking in basement, some foundation issues which have mostly been addressed, and the drafty windows. All of which we will be getting inspected before any final decisions. 

My partner and I are in a living situation which does not require any rent so we've been able to save. This is where it starts to worry me. So, as of last week I started going part time (willing to go back to FT if needed, 3.3k/mo) and now make roughly 2k a month, he is unemployed but has the resources to go back to making at least 4k a month with a job he doesn't necessarily want back but is always welcomed to. I would guess our joint monthly expenses at this point are at around 1.1k and we have 30k in savings. I currently am 27k in debt from student loans and pay a little under 300 monthly. He would prefer to be PT as well so we both have time to work on the house so realistically im setting our budget (subtracting expenses) to be roughly 3.1k.

To me, there is just sooo many things that could go wrong because we would essentially be sinking all of our savings to close on this house then potentially spend all of our money just barely getting by....I'm just endlessly anxious and my partner seems to be fairly confident in the numbers, its something we both want but it's just a huuuge risk. I'd love to just stay in the place we're at and save up for a bit longer but this seems like a great opportunity and we really want to have our own place.

After immediately reporting it to n26, they told me to contact Google to verify they are unauthorised payments, which I did. Google confirmed they were fraudulent payments and to contact my n26 bank. 

Then n26 told me they will contact Mastercard and wait 30-45 days for an answer. I ordered a new card, changed my n26 password but then in November, I had another unauthorised payment stolen to a total of 1.1k this time. The crazy thing is, I only had 500€ in my main account so I don't know how they accessed my other account. I do not have overdraft. I reported it to n26 and they told me to verify with Google, which I am waiting. I am shocked it is taking this long to be reimbursed and I have no idea how the scammers accessed my other savings account. 

Did anyone go through something similar? Did you get your money back from your bank?

Since 2021 I have had a 7/1 ARM with a 1.75% interest rate on a condo I really like. I make $200K/year, have a very stable job, live frugally and I can save about $2K per month. I have been investing the money into ETFs that track markets (VOO, QQQ) because I am not an expert investor. I now have money set aside to pay for the cost of refinancing my 7/1 ARM into a more regular 20-year mortgage by 2028, when my low 7/1 ARM rate expires. My retirement contributions total about 9% of my salary and those investments have been going very well. I have no debt other than the mortgage. I need some advice: should I continue investing my monthly savings in low-risk ETFs that track the market, or should I use it to pay some of the principal on my mortgage every month? I like the idea of lowering my mortgage debt so that I pay less mortgage interest, but I don’t know if that’s better than investing the money into ETFs that track the stock market.

personalfinance,1gmhhwk,Headstart in finance? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmhhwk/headstart_in_finance/,8,"
Hey, I’m a recent high school graduate looking to just get a headstart from others when joining the financial workforce. I’m planning on doing a commerce degree or even a comm/eco degree at uni. 

What do you guys recommend I do to improve my financial knowledge? Should I be reading books/doing courses? Should I be cold calling small finance businesses for some sort of free internship?

Just looking for someone to point me in the right direction. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,1gmhh4g,Financial planning and car purchase - sensible?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gmhh4g/financial_planning_and_car_purchase_sensible/,7,"Hi everyone:

I'd love your insights on a couple of questions. Here’s a bit about my background :

I'm a recent graduate who has just started working in Denmark. My salary averages around $104,000 USD per year, but after taxes and pension contributions, I take home around $55,000. My job is stable. Living costs in Copenhagen are high, though I do have an apartment fully paid for. This keeps my monthly expenses (utilities, food, internet, phone, land tax etc.) around $1,800 USD. However, I’m considering relocating to a nicer neighborhood in a few years, which will require some savings given the higher housing prices in those areas.

1. Denmark currently have a government sponsored electric car incentive, in which you get a MASSIVE cut on the registration fees for electric car imports. To get an idea of how much this registration fee usually costs, if you buy a car for around 50k, the registration costs will be around an additional 30-40k. For electic cars this gets a flat 20k discount, and then a 60 percent off for anything exceeding that.

This policy will slowly diminish after 2025. That is why I was wondering if it will be a good idea to get an electric car before 2026. Since I want to be using the car for a long time, I was considering something used in the 50-60k range. Is this sensible? Any advice for someone in my situation? I can charge at my workplace, but not at home.

2. How would you recommend dividing your income among savings, investments and wants/needs? And what level of risk is reasonable in my case for stock market investments? Interest rates in Denmark are generally low, even for high-yield savings accounts (around 2–3%).

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Edit: I do have a fully paid for old Audi (2011) here aswell. After considering the green fees, gas and parking fees, I am looking at approximately 400 USD extra each month for payments.  And the government campaign dimishes by around 8 percent, until it fully stops in 2035.

Edit 2: My estimated down payment is 50 percent of the car's cost.",2024-11-08 12:34:57

I'm paying $400 car payments every month for the past 6 months of a 60 month loan. I'm seeing the amount going towards interest decreasing and more going to principal but is there any way to lower my interest rate? My credit score has gone up much more than when I had originally gotten the car so that's good. I know I should be paying extra every month so I'll start upping it to $450 and maybe $500 if I have longer hours at work but does anyone have advice? I know it was a stupid decision but I barely had any options with car dealerships with bad credit.,2024-11-08 15:58:26

Thanks you for the comments, told them I will not pay a deposit until viewing the property.

First time Moving/Renting.

Landlord out of province asking for Security Deposit before viewing rental property.

Is this a scam or common practice?

They say they are unable to accept a cheque as they are out of province.

They have offered to provide their ID along with their identity/face. But this doesn't secure that they are the owner/deed holder of the property. 

What is common practice when paying deposit? They want the deposit out down before they come to the province. 

What are some things I can do to protect myself against a scam. ",2024-11-07 18:57:21
