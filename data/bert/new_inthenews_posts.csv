Hey Reddit, Charles Blow, Lydia Polgreen and Michelle Cottle here. We've been closely watching the presidential election play out and written extensively about the Trump and Harris campaigns. Today, we’ll dive into Trump's victory and what to expect next. Ask us anything!

From Charles: I write about national politics, public opinion and social justice, with a focus on racial equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. I’ve been a columnist at Opinion since 2008. I am a political analyst for MSNBC, and I live in Atlanta. Recently, I explained how [Trump has embraced vulgarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/donald-trump-arnold-palmer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.vKwf.QXHqrtsji93e&smid=re-nytopinion) to exploit the gender gap among particularly young voters.

From Lydia: I write about the world, culture and politics, with an emphasis on human rights, migration, queer lives and democracy. I spent a decade as an international correspondent for The Times in West Africa, South Asia and South Africa. “Whether Harris wins or loses, it is hard to escape the feeling that the past year has produced a tragic victory for Trump’s scapegoating of Muslims, leaving many Arab and Muslim Americans feeling expendable,” [I argue in a recent column](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/opinion/trump-harris-gaza-arab-americans.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.6GoJ.GObL5CZTdjyB&smid=re-nytopinion).

From Michelle: I recently reflected on some of the most [defining moments of this campaign season](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/opinion/election-trump-harris-campaign-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.gPP2.LHaWyXCgbtne&smid=re-nytopinion), from Donald Trump’s indictments to Project 2025. I have covered Washington since the Clinton administration and am a host of “Matter of Opinion,” a weekly podcast where I discuss a singular topic with my colleagues.

**We’ll start answering questions at 12 p.m. E.T. on Wednesday, November 6th.**

Hi! Nick Kristof here. I recently visited the [Chad-Sudan border to report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/opinion/sudan-famine-rape-murder.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.YZYZ.5NcNZH37Mnao&smid=re-nytopinion) on the [murder, rape and starvation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/opinion/darfur-sudan-atrocities.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.cFPt.cHJVWCtVG9Ta&smid=re-nytopinion) that have [devastated Sudan](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/opinion/sudan-darfur-rape.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.lB8_.RIxukPh9WSZv&smid=re-nytopinion) since the civil war began last year. As I wrote in a [September column](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/darfur-sudan-famine.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.Jqaq.nyAyfbqJ7fhS&smid=re-nytopinion), “the world is distracted and silent” about the atrocities in Sudan. “Impunity is allowing violence to go unchecked, which, in turn, is producing what may become the worst famine in half a century or more.” You can check out a video of what I witnessed in Darfur [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@nytopinion/video/7416341498834472238).

I have also recently argued that [people shouldn’t demean Trump voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/opinion/trump-voters-liberal-civil.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.aOMn._vFw6G96bQRS&smid=re-nytopinion) and explained [how President Biden can push for a peace deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/opinion/sinwar-gaza-biden-netanyahu.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.caP1.VmMKx-O7JJIy&smid=re-nytopinion) to end the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.  

I’ve been a columnist for The Times since 2001 and have served as a correspondent at the paper in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Beijing and Tokyo. My memoir about my career in journalism, “[Chasing Hope: A Reporter’s Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/opinion/journalism-reporting-progress.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.XP6a.RIDxGkGihwPQ&smid=re-nytopinion),” was published in May.

Ask me anything about the deepening conflict in Sudan, the war in the Middle East or the upcoming U.S. election. 

I’ll answer your questions from 2-3 p.m. E.T. on Wednesday, Oct. 30th.
