I mean, I’m sure there’s some days that are a blip, but that’s kind of everything.”

> Over the course of the series, Shipka’s character witnessed her TV parents Don and Betty Draper (played by Jon Hamm and January Jones) behaving extraordinarily badly. But, she explained, the show’s creators and crew made sure she was protected from the more adult content during filming.

> “I was reacting to, like, Jon playing Words with Friends on his phone as an eye line and not the real deal,” she told Ferguson.

> “They were so protective over me and my kind of innocence and not exposing me to stuff that, you know, was sensitive or more adult,” she explained.

> “I always knew what I was reacting to. Like, I always knew what I was walking in on,” she said. “I just didn’t have to see it over and over again.”

> “I think at a certain point, I was like, ‘Guys, I know what this is. Like, I’m good. I’m fine,’ ” Shipka added. “But I really, like, admire and respect the way that they handled it. But I do think in my head, I was probably like, ‘I’m mature. I’m an adult. I know what’s going on here. Like, it’s fine, guys.’ ”",2024-11-12 20:45:23

Sometimes it's dark, serious and sometimes it's kind of silly but it all makes for some great television and some really standout moments. There are a ton of people on this show who went on to become more well known later on and the acting is always superb, all sorts of people, some truly nasty villains to characters who may try to find a bit of redemption.

television,1gpqfc2,How long between seasons before you start losing interest in a show?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gpqfc2/how_long_between_seasons_before_you_start_losing/,38,"Back in the 2010's Game of Thrones managed to release a new season every year,  except for season 8. And imo, that kind of turnaround is perfect for maintaining cultural relevancy and hype for the next season.

But it feels like shows nowadays are so slow to release new seasons. For example it's been over 3 years since the first season of Squid Game, and I've basically lost interest in a season 2. I just read it's releasing in December but I feel like I've moved on from it. If it came out a year after the first I know I would be excited.

I don't understand the psychology as to why I am less forgiving to turnaround times with TV Shows than movies, because with films I'm quite content with 3 years between installments. Maybe it's to do with there being more information in series and you therefore need to spend more time rewatching if you want to get caught up and remain invested. I'm not sure.

But does anybody else feel this way, or does it not bother you? Also what do you think is the perfect time between seasons?",2024-11-12 17:39:25

People on the Internet are going to dissect every clue in every episode, and if you do a good job foreshadowing your twist that's enough to get people to guess it. Famously, this happened in Westworld Season 1, and the creators responded by making S2 as convoluted as possible.

But Agatha All Along managed to do the impossible: nobody guessed the big twist that the Road was a con made by Agatha and brought to life by Billy. There were tons of clues, and while there had been speculation that Billy made the road, nobody put it all together. I think that everyone was so distracted by the identities of Teen and Rio Vidal that they missed the larger narrative.

It totally changes the previous episodes and explains so much: why Agatha didn't need to find a real green witch, how Agatha figured out that Teen was Billy, even stuff that just seemed like bad writing (like the fact that there was an actual Westview subway station). They even showed us her con in episode 2. FFS, the show was called Agatha All Along!

Emily in Paris and Game of Thrones both feature characters who are thrust into foreign environments and must navigate complex social hierarchies—Emily in Paris's fashion world and Game of Thrones' deadly political landscape. Emily is a mix of Daenerys and Sansa, all three characters start out as naïve but through experience learn to gain control over their environment.

Both Emily in Paris and Game of Thrones are filled with drama, ambition, and characters who constantly face challenges to their values and alliances. Both series showcase visually stunning settings (Paris and Westeros) that are almost like characters themselves, adding to the shows’ appeal.

**The Penguin - GoTham**

The Penguin and Game of Thrones share a gritty, dark atmosphere and a world of moral ambiguity where characters are willing to do whatever it takes to gain power. Like the brutal politics in Game of Thrones, The Penguin centers on a power struggle within Gotham's criminal underworld, with characters navigating shifting alliances and betrayals.

Both series showcase antiheroes—characters who aren't purely good but are fascinating to watch as they battle rivals in high-stakes, dangerous settings. The shows are visually dark, with each city (Gotham and King's Landing) reflecting the chaotic, ruthless societies within.

**Ted Lasso - Just Like GoT, innit?**

Ted Lasso and Game of Thrones revolve around intrigue, power plays, and characters with hidden depths—even dark sides. In Ted Lasso, beneath the humor and kindness, we see characters wrestling with personal demons, secrets, and intense rivalries, just like in Game of Thrones, where loyalties shift, and inner struggles affect the larger story.

Both shows explore the impact of leadership styles: Ted's optimism contrasts with the ruthless rule of many in Westeros, yet both styles yield complex results, influencing their ""kingdoms"" in unexpected ways. Each series reveals how personal ambition, emotional scars, and internal conflicts can dramatically alter the course of relationships and outcomes.

television,1gpdj86,Are modern shows becoming maximalist in their story telling?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gpdj86/are_modern_shows_becoming_maximalist_in_their/,4,"Do others feel that modern shows (post-2019) focus more on dense, complex storytelling compared to older ones? It seems like the TV industry has become a practice ground for aspiring writers, which has shifted many contemporary shows to be more writer-driven. As a result, the visual and aesthetic aspects of these shows often take a backseat, and the pacing has become faster to fit in more plot and dialogue. Breaking Bad feels like the show that started this trend, as it was heavily shaped by its writer's room.

In contrast, many older shows placed greater emphasis on style and the visual medium, often prioritizing atmosphere over detailed exposition.

On a side note, I think Severance is a refreshing change. It prioritizes creating a world where much of the story is told through the visuals, allowing the audience to interpret things for themselves. The mystery is maintained through tight, minimalist storytelling, which makes it stand out from the current trend.",2024-11-12 05:21:24
television,1gpas0a,Penguin (CHARACTER THEORY),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gpas0a/penguin_character_theory/,0,"Vic and an unique opportunity.

Vic can still be the best Robin we've ever seen.

Hear me out. I actually think his current predicament is a fulfilling arc – for him and for the Penguin. You shouldn't be cheering for a Penguin/Vic duo against the Bat, and that would definitely be a possibility if everything ended neatly in the series. We had a good man in Vic, and they defined the monster in Cobb. All set.

However, there's a HUGE opportunity here to give us a Robin we really care about on the big screen (seriously, none of them have mattered until this point).
Here's the thing – it's not unusual in medicine for people who have been choked to recover with the proper, hasty, and accurate assistance. Once pressure around the neck loosens and air returns, it isn't a 100% guaranteed death sentence. He didn't have a rope around his neck maintaining pressure. The big problem with saving Vic is how to do it creatively. Maybe show in Batman 2 that Batman was already spying on the Penguin? Maybe his mistress knew something? Perhaps one of the other gangs, a newly crafted character? Or something different entirely. What matters is that it's a carefully written save.

If that is taken care of, we can have the best Robin ever. Here's why. WE DON'T have the time to properly develop a Robin - we never do. Him, we know everything about already. We know his heart and will know his motivations to do good and catch bad guys, especially one. He can spend a big part of the second movie being a side character, just recovering, with Batman getting to know him to study the Penguin from a good guy's perspective, and eventually seeing something in him too. Batman doesn't kill, so near the end, he might need some testimony or dirt on Cobb to put him behind bars. Ultimately, Bruce might train Vic.
If well made, we may have in a third movie, finally, a serious Batman and Robin.
Maybe during the second movie, helped by the Penguin and the counselor's interest to get more votes, Crown Point starts to thrive, and in a third feature, a new crooked villain like Harvey Dent (since we started touching politics) screws the neighborhood again, and the new Robin – who helped against his nemesis in an indirect way – can now help his neighborhood with his own hands.

Furthermore, since we don't know Colin Farrell's availability (he already stated that he wants a break from Cobb), the second movie could focus on a completely different villain.  Vic's recovery and training could be a minor arc, saving the final Batman and Robin vs the Penguin face-off for the last installment of a trilogy. I bet making more movies and money wouldn't be a problem...
Ultimately, I'm completely okay with everything ending the way it did. Maybe, just maybe, Cobb ""killing"" Vic is the only way to shatter his loyalty. And Vic being saved is probably the only chance for a truly relatable Robin.

What do you guys think? I would love to know.
Thanks for reading and sharing ideas.",2024-11-12 02:49:34

Then . . . . dang (no spoilers)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gpb6xa/and_there_was_me_liking_the_penguin_show_less_and/,4,"At first I liked The Penguin. Obviously the production values were great and he action and drama were fantastic. But I didn't like that fact that Batman didn't even get mentioned or showed as some non-central, peripheral character - like maybe a news clip on a TV in a room or something.  I mean, I thought the unused clip of Batman on top of a moving car in Suicide Squad was an amazing way to show him from the point of view of the other Gotham characters. It makes him mysterious to us.   
Anyway, I expect to see him a bit in season 2 of The Penguin. And I really like the idea that the show isn't about Batman but we get to see him almost as bystanders would.  
  
My biggest gripe with the show though was that I felt they were trying to humanize Oz with this 'attentive son' routine and also with the doting sidekick he took under his wing.   
As the episodes rolled by, I could see what a truly horrible, self absorbed creep Oz is and i was thinking 'are we supposed to route for this psychotic monster?'   
I was annoyed with Lauren LeFranc, the creator of the show, for lack of bravery and for pandering us to have sympathy for the devil.   
Well, no spoilers here but the last two episodes were a broken bottle to the gut.   
Well played Lauren, well played.

This was fucking it.
Off all the live action batman content I have seen, one thing that I miss was the need for Batman. I mean even in batman begins, we knew that the city was corrupt and all that, but never knew what kind of creatures are in it, that it needs Batman so fucking hard. But this series is literally the answer to that, Gotham is no joke. The city is for the villans and the supervillain gets the chance to move on the ladder and be on top. 
I was don't know why rooting for Penguin, until the most important scene of the series appears, the brutal murder of Vic. That moment, I realised that, what a kind of villan Penguin really is. He even smirked and threw the driver's license of Vic, so that no one can recognize him. Poor Vic didn't get a chance to get a funeral and grave of his name.
Also the scene with his mom. And that tear, while Oz saying him, this was all you ever wanted. She realized what kind of monster she was growing up. 
Also the character of Sofia was awesome, I want this kind of Women characters to be written, having a personality of their own. Not kind of Marvel shit. She was the limelight of the series, but she can't compete the craziness that Penguin had. 
One of the most important thing this series had, was the personality of Gothm a d need for Batman.

> Slate added, “It’s almost magical, in this weird way, to think about it. There’s a lot of weird rewards that come from situations that we might think are more shadowy.”

> Although Slate’s premature dismissal from the cast in 2010 was thought to be a result of her accidentally saying “f—” during her first episode, the actress has clarified it was simply because she “didn’t click” with the show.

> Slate’s departure from SNL gave her “a belief in the long game. A belief in many, many options. It’s always important to believe in something plural rather than primacy. It’s really important to believe that there’s actually 20 really cool, weird, secret doors, rather than one big golden ornate legendary door.

television,1gozs47,Rant about Race Across the World Series 3 as a Canadian - It is too scripted,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gozs47/rant_about_race_across_the_world_series_3_as_a/,8,"Watching episode 6 (Manitoulin Island to Québec City) and it became clear to me just how scripted the whole thing is. I grew up in Toronto / Greater Toronto Area and moved to Québec City 3 years ago

The biggest tell, the fact that Kevin & Claudia and Tricia & Cathie were forced to spend a second night in Montréal. I know a big theme of the show is ""Europeans being shocked that North America has poor transport links"" and yes this is a **major** problem, especially in Western Canada. But while the Québec City to Windsor Corridor (i.e. Southern Ontario & Southern Québec; i.e. where 50% of Canada lives) could do way better; there are more than sufficient and affordable transit links. It is super easy to travel between Montréal and Québec City. You can check for yourself here: [https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Montreal/Quebec#trips](https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Montreal/Quebec#trips)

If you want to travel by Train, Via Rail has, on Saturdays, 5 trains from Montréal to Québec. In fact almost all of these trains originate in Ottawa; Zaineb and Mobeen took the last train out of Ottawa that day, which as of current schedules leaves Ottawa at 16:05, reaches Montréal at 18:04, leaves Montréal at 18:25 and arrives at Québec City at 21:48. There was absolutely no need for Kevin & Claudia and Tricia & Cathie to stay the whole night, the train was empty as we saw, they could have gotten tickets on that train.

Say they had to keep working past 18:00; well then they can take a bus. Orléans Express has busses departing at 19:00, 20:00 and even 22:00.

Also, Montréal to Québec you can **Easily** rideshare via Kangaride: https://www.kangaride.com/rideshares/montreal-to-quebec/qc. Most students / people on a tight budget I know going between the two cities use that.

So yeah, them all ending up on the same bus, just all killing a second day in Montréal; and Monique and Ladi spending a whole day there (cause they decided to just camp in Tobermory for some strange reason); made me realize how scripted the whole thing is. And how fake it is. Not much of a race if one time can travel through Montréal while the other two are forced to spend a night.

I watched the show cause I love the concept; as someone who loves ot read maps and take intercity trains and explore and all. But this is too fake to be enjoyable

Other thoughts:

* Kevin getting lost at Union Station is too real. Everyone has had that experience; heck even I when I went back to visit Toronto got temporarily lost at Union.
* On the otherhand; taking the GO to Guildwood to catch the Via is Hilarious but also not something you would logically do. If you really want to have them take the GO Train more, find an excuse for them to take the GO to Oshawa and then catch the Via; idk have them go sightseeing to the Scarborough Bluffs
* Related to that, wisht here was more a subplot of them navigating transit system within major cities. I'd love to see Claudia & Kevin taking the GO Train from Guelph to Toronto with all the commuters. And then GO Training to Burlington to bus to Niagara (and bus back after 30 mins kinda insane how tight it all was)
* Which leads me to ask, do they need to sightsee? Also I am doubtful how Kevin & Claudia had time to take the GO from Guelph to Toronto, take the ferry to the Island and back, GO Train over to Burlington; Bus to Niagara; do the whole thing again, and get an afternoon 15:17 train to Montréal. (Also there are trains at 17:02 & 18:02 so...). They could have easily hung out at Niagara a bit longer. Cause at that point they did no sightseeing
* Tricia and Cathie, the show showed scenes of them Navigating the Montréal Metro, and then showed them getting on the Orléans Express bus at Ottawa towards Montréal. So congrats; all the viewers will now think that Ottawa has a subway system.
* Earlier (and later) episodes also have plot holes. The Coach bus can take you to Prince Albert, you cannot go from there to the Provincial Park; that is 90 km more North (and as you know by now, has no transit). Likewise how did Zeinab and Mobeen get from Halifax to Liverpool?
* Tricia and Cathie same episode too *The Canadian* between Saskatoon and Melville. Wished they spoke a bit more about that train, as it is a big tourist draw in Canada (and almost as unreliable as the Churchill Train to get you on time anywhere)
* Are Kevin and Claudia not allowed to just stay up all night at Gare Centrale; a café; a university campus; wherever. Not too hard to stay up all night in a major city if you want to. The whole thing felt like a massive forced endeavour by the Producers
* Forcing Kevin & Claudia to go bacnkrupt and waste a night in Montréal; kind a clear what they are all about, and the story line they were going for (ha ha stupid folks who waste money on taxis go bankrupt)
* Hate the reality TV forced drama. 

I could go on. Guess in two sentence it would be : ""Amazing concept; poor execution""",2024-11-11 18:49:02

Gabriella has been with three men. Now don’t get me wrong I’m not shaming her. But the writers seem to think she is only valuable in this show if she’s written to be with a man. Like her sole purpose is to be the love interest. Forget character development. She has a similar back story to Station 19 Maya of being an Olympic (?) athlete turned firefighter which is pretty cool. But nope let’s just focus on her being with Bodie and then all she does is make stupid decisions that could easily be avoided, or solved.And don’t get me started on Bode who only thinks with his small head. Episode 4 has him redeeming himself a bit realizing that although he is the main character of the show he isn’t the main character in life. Hopefully this doesn’t turn into a sappy love drama cos the fire fighting is the real draw in.

I don't know who thought that because she got lucky enough to be in a Bond film, she's suddenly lead actress material and to have 1/2 the story revolve around her. And of course we have the obligatory family drama and the teenage daughter which seems a rule these days.

The idea that a young black woman is going to have an asset in the Irish militia is laughable, a pure modern day writers fantasy.

It was about two Aliens who come to earth, disguised as humans, and adopt a group of children to blend. Only the children know the parents' secret and are just kind of cool with it.

It was a very wholesome children's comedy show. I recall lots of hijinks where the kids are covering up for their parents' strange behaviour. 

Tony Gardner as the aliens dad Brian Johnson was the standout performer (the two actresses who played the mum Sophie were also great). He was just so delightfully weird. Very similar to Bryan Cranston's dad character Hal in Malcolm in the Middle. The material Gardner got in the show wasn't quite his good but he chewed the hell out of that script and was very funny.

Anyway, I'd like to see Gardner get a Breaking Bad-esque comeback with a gritty meaty script. Like how has this dude not starred in a gritty UK cop show yet? There's literally so many of them made these days and Gardner is a respected actor.

He's starred in plenty of comedies like The Thick of It and Fresh Meat where he's played more mature even seedier roles...but I think he has a Bafta worthy performance in him.

Cranston also couldn't get big dramatic roles for years due to playing Hal. He seemed too much like that dweeby dad, according to casting agents. Just like how I bet casting agents view Gardner.",2024-11-09 19:16:59

Heimerdinger: He used to be a mysterious, smart almost immortal being that didn’t really understand how human short lives and minds worked. He felt so magical, and now he is playing spies and is being used as a comic relief? Nah… so sad 

Jinx: My favorite character by far… they created the perfect psycho broken character but we all still care so deeply for her. And now, is all kind of gone, her dialogue is empty, she doesn’t feel the same anymore, they try to make her badass without the psycho and it doesn’t work for me

Any advantages to purchasing the complete set on iTunes? Any differences, does anyone know? Also, is the Youtube version legal? Is it a public domain show now or something? Rare to see complete episodes on Youtube of a show unless it's not available elsewhere or is public domain.

Just wondering if anyone knows if there's any differences between the episodes on both services. Thanks.",2024-11-09 15:49:37

A Chinese-backed Mexican drug cartel (supposedly also supported by the Mexican government in alliance with Beijing) kidnaps a U.S. politician advocating for stricter anti-drug laws, killing her family in the process. The Lioness team of hard boiled CIA veterans rescues the heroic politician and (in the absurd plot twist that follows) sends an undercover agent after the drug lord responsible. This agent is the daughter of the drug lord's brother, who lives in the U.S. and works as an immigration lawyer (what else!! 😆) while secretly assisting his drug lord sibling. The undercover heroine's compelling reason  for taking on the mission? The non debatable, convincing argument of Lioness head  Joe (Zoe Saldana) ""I love my country and don’t want it speaking Chinese or Russian."" The nonsense is unbearable—it feels like J.D. Vance must have written the script. Throw in ‘authentic’ family scenes where the heroine’s kids sell lemonade on the street and their dad giving them a lesson about what ""transphobic""  really means.

Hope everyone’s doing well.

Like how on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the actor playing Xander has had a lot of issues and problems with the law and just been a dirtbag and not a particularly great person. But pretty much the rest of the cast (for the most part) is very likable and good to fans.

Seinfeld has Seinfeld who’s known to be a huge dick and the actor playing Kramer who has been involved in a lot of controversy (mainly the racist rant).

William Shatner was very disliked on Star Trek, but it seems he’s mellowed out a ton in recent years.

I wanted to say maybe Good Morning Miss Bliss, whose run would retroactively be retitled as Saved by the Bell: The Junior High Years, which would be followed by Saved by the Bell, but I think it's fair to say those are 2 different shows where Saved by the Bell is the sequel series.

> “It really threw me when we were going through the first show,” he recalled. “I didn’t have a skit, but I was watching another one. I said to Lorne, ‘There’s a doctor in this skit. Why don’t I play the doctor?’ And he says, ‘Garrett, people might be thrown by a Black doctor.’ Now mind you I had come from New Orleans, where you’re surrounded by Black medical doctors and Black PhDs.

I know it got a lot of acclaim and popularity when it was airing but in recent years I wasn't really feeling like getting into a show that had a bunch of dirty, corrupt cops as its protagonists. But a few weeks ago, I decided to finally give it a shot - and instantly *devoured* my way through the entire series very quickly. 

I can see why it's considered as one of the GOAT cop shows and one of the best shows in general. It really is incredible - a dark, visceral and brutal odyssey acting as an exploration of greed and the hunger for power and control. It starts off solid enough - the first season is good not great, and acts as a nice introduction to the characters and the world they inhabit. But it levels up in a big way in subsequent seasons, as the stakes escalate and Vic and his crew find themselves spiralling further and further into an abyss of their own making.

The Shield reminds me in many ways of Breaking Bad in its steady escalation of just how utterly shitty things get for its protagonists. And the beautiful thing is, *everything* that happens can be traced back to the very first episode, when Vic makes that fateful decision to shoot Terry Crowley in the face. The consequences of that one incident reverberates throughout the entire series up until the very end. The Armenian money train story arc, Forest Whitaker's time on the show, Antwon Mitchell etc...there are so many fantastic arcs throughout the show. 

The acting is exemplary - Michael Chiklis as Vic Mackey is one of the best anti-hero protagonists, ever. I think he belongs on the Mount Rushmore of other similar anti-heroes like Walter White, Don Draper, Tony Soprano etc. He's an utterly loathsome human being, an arrogant, egotistical, corrupt asshole - but Chiklis is *so* damn good at imbuing him with humanity, vulnerability and even warmth that you can't help but root for him.

The supporting cast is great, especially Walton Goggins, who is amazing in pretty much everything. Shane eventually becomes just as compelling of a character as Vic. 

What really elevates The Shield to the upper echelon are two things. The first is the fact that it just gets better and better every season. The story arcs all build on themselves and create an intense pressure cooker situation that just gets more intense each episode. It's rare for a show to have its best seasons be its final ones, but that's exactly how I feel about seasons 6 and 7.

The second is the ending, which has to be one of, if not the best, endings to any show I've seen. The conclusion is devastating and powerful, and is one of the best examples of ""karmic justice"" I've seen in a show with an asshole protagonist that feels justified and well-earned. 

I'm gonna be thinking about this show for a while, and hell, may even decide to rewatch it soon.",2024-11-03 21:54:45

While I think they're kinda nice looking when they're short, **I've been wondering why they're suddenly a thing?** I imagine it's because of Marvel applying the MCU title card from the movies onto the Disney+ shows, but recognition of a brand hasn't been an issue before so it seems superfluous unless the different shows within a franchise are hard to tell they're related (again, like Marvel's shows can be to non-fans).",2024-11-05 18:35:52

> After some time away, Samberg reflected that he still looks back on the experience fondly. ""It sounds very corny and rehearsed, but I'm just always like I still can't believe I get to do comedy for a living,"" Samberg told Hart. ""It's all I wanted to do. I got to be on SNL.

There are quite a few brutal and violent deaths that are clearly deaths.  No, ""oh, I heard a squelching noise offscreen"" sort of thing.  More the, ""Oh, this man got slowly disintegrated from head to toe watching his flesh and skeleton turn to dust"" type.

I liked it but I felt it was a bit slow and the finale didn't really make sense to me. Spoilers ahead. So, we learn that the house was feeding on all the remaining Crains. The house feeds on people and they wouldn't destroy the house because Crain Sr. made a deal to leave the house as is for the housekeepers to be able to visit their deceased daughter. What I don't understand is the internal logic of it all. The house is feeding on them and nothing changes in the end. It is not stablished that the house won't keep doing its thing on the Crains. As far as I saw, no change on the house dynamic was stablished, like the Crains won't be threatened now. Yes, they all confront their fears and their ""disease"" but that's not why the house fed on them in the first place. When they arrive at the house, the family was healthy. The marriage of the Crains was good and they were a happy family and even then the house started feeding on all the Crains since all of them see ghosts and enter the red room. 

They talk at the end that a house can have a disease and a house can be your marriage, relationships and many other things and you can heal them, but the Crains weren't ""sick"" when they arrive at Hill House. So how is this a happy ending? They will be haunted until they die horrible deaths because nothing changed in the house dynamic?

Another theme that I think gets broken is the one about honesty. We get a final montage of the Crains finally being honest with the people around them, but then Crain Sr. asks Steve to keep the secret that destroyed the Crains in the first place. Like ""yeah, be honest, but not honest"". The main secret is that their mother killed a little girl. It comes in contradiction from what was stablished, that truth sets you free. I thought it was a great message that you can't really protect your kids forever and keep them locked up to avoid anything happening to them (and it extends to the people you love) and then, Steve is asked not to reveal a horrible truth about their mother, something that absolutely has to be told. 

I think Monagan wrote himself into a corner and wanted to give a heartfelt message at the end but it came at odds of what he had stablished in the show. The show is good but I felt the ending came a bit undone... or did I miss something? ",2024-11-04 19:23:55

While all the shows are special and fun in their own rights, I think Gemstones may be the strongest. The evolution in writing and directing from McBride (who has proven himself to be a very capable director), Jody Hill and David Gordon Green is evident and praiseworthy. Not to mention McBride co-wrote the song “Misbehavin”, which is an adorable and catchy bop! 

It is always refreshing to see the selection of character actors for each show and how all casts truly hold their own. The humor may be vulgar and absurd, but it is balanced out with such poignancy and nuance. 

I absolutely believe The Righteous Gemstones has what it takes to compete with the big boys at the Emmys for the main categories, not just the technical and aesthetic categories, which are merited nominations!

So, there is something I want to talk about, respectfully.
In the last couple of years, hollywood has been super intense with all this inclusive thing, which I agree with if done coherently.
Why do I say this? 
Because, when we read a book, play a videogame or watch a show or movie, is really exciting to see the diversity across the world of that universe, and by diversity I mean, geographically, the wild life, culture, people, everything that is involved, like, in the real world. For example, in game of thrones we do not see all the same diversity in each town/city, every region has its own characteristics based on a lot of things, for example, the people from bravos seems to be some kind of Iberic, the Ones from Dorne looks like they are frome the middle east or something, the ones on the red keep could be european, and so on. And, for that these people would cross path, they needed to travel A LONG WAY, and the show make us feel that, they don’t do it in five minutes, it takes a lot to make the journey.
So, in this context, the latest show, doesn’t feel like that, take The Witcher and The Ring of Power as an example, every single town, has the same people over and over, there are european people, african people, asian people, with no given reason, like, migration, trade, or something, they are just there, just to be inclusive, and make the world in that universe to be, I don’t know, kind of flat, like every town is new york, cities have no peculiarities compared to others, which, is honestly boring. Take for example ring of power, there is a super remote Island, you go there, there are people from all over the world, how did the get there, who knows. Then, you cross the ocean and a whole continent, and what you find, people from all over the world in a tiny tiny town, how did they get there, who knows.
So, my question is..
For all the people taking the time to read this:
Do you really feel related to any of these characters that they are putting there with no context at all just to be inclusive? I need ti ask because, I feel I don’t, most of these characters looks void to me, and that they are being forced just to hollywood can pay their diversity fee and be on good terms with everyone, but making that universe really unrealistic, since, not every city is new york city and much less a medieval village.
Give me your opinion, I really want to know if you feel related to any character if these new shows, if you really connect with any of these universe, and why, and if not, would love to hear you too.",2024-11-04 18:12:40

I was recently rewatching my comfort show, Boardwalk Empire, in the French dub (as a learner) for the first time and I was quite shocked that they made the decision to dub one of the main characters, Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano, a Sicilian born Italian-American with a thick New York accent in the original, to have a strong native Italian accent in this version. This was especially weird because the show is full of Italian Americans and the only ones that also got this treatment already had Italian accents in the original, nor did it happen with any other nationality from what I could tell. Whatsmore, major characters with native Irish accents which are commented upon within the show speak in the same mainland French accent as the rest of the cast (if there were audible distinctions in the accents to natives, I'm afraid I'm not advanced enough to pick up on it).

I'm more intrigued by this decision than anything since it changes the interpretation of a lot of scenes. Early on there are a few scenes where Charlie's grammar is corrected, especially by his Jewish-American older boss/mentor Arnold Rothstein, which in the original has a kind of 'Pygmalion' quality of trying to teach a lower class uneducated street tough to integrate and swindle his way into polite society, but with the dub noticeably being Charlie's second language, it seems more like Arnold is trying to integrate Charlie more smoothly into his adopted country. However, this also heightens the racist undertones of certain subtle passive-aggressive comments that Arnold makes to Charlie about Italians throughout (e.g., referring to the D'Alessio brothers; ""Do you know what the nice thing about the Bronx Zoo is, Charlie? There are bars between you and the monkeys""). And overall it simply changes the dynamic of a lot of scenes when one character noticeably has an accent and the decisions he makes. Especially putting more weight on the Americanisation of his birth name from 'Salvatore 'Totò' Lucania' to 'Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano', which in the original seems like more of a distinction of him as an American 'Young Turk' from the old world Sicilian 'Moustache Petes', but in the dub comes across as more of an insecure overcompensation to integrate himself as an American and distance himself from his roots.

Of course, Charlie Luciano was a real person and while no known recordings of his voice exists, by all accounts he had a New York accent, having moved over to the USA as a child. However, I don't have a problem with historical fiction taking a few liberties (e.g., casting a 5ft5 37 year old Stephen Graham to play the 5ft10 20 year old Al Capone), especially a dub since they also weren't all speaking French.

Are there any examples of dubs that made a significant change which affected characters or story in any shows you've watched? What were you most surprised about, whether you watched the original or the dub first? The obvious example being the infamous Spanish dub of the Supernatural finale (which I'm aware of despite never having watched a single episode of that show). I'm quite new to dubs myself, including French, so I'm unsure just how common practice this is.",2024-11-04 03:18:14

The last couple of years of the show were run on the USA Network in a primetime slot for a few years.  The show was extremely well written and it's notable that this is a soap that had more than a 50% male audience.  While the show had the typical love triangles and romance plots it's main focus was on a police force, lawyers and their families.  It had a heavy police procedural theme as many plots were about solving crimes, there were gangsters, bad cops and murders and various other crimes that needed solving.  The show also had a larger male cast than other soaps at the time.

I had first heard this show a long time ago but was never able to see it until 2006 when AOL used to have a small streaming service it was called In2TV then AOL video, there was a small section of soap opera shows on their that had been long cancelled and this was one of them and ended up binging through the episodes they had.  They had over 200 episodes on there by the time the streaming service was shut down.  They would upload a certain amount of episodes at a time every couple of weeks.

I love vampires, and I like the ""brooding vampire"" trope, so I decided to give TVD a chance. I watched Supernatural, Buffy, Angel and I love action so I expected this to be more like them, with fights and cool action scenes, epic larger than life battles etc. It seems to me TVD is... not that.

television,1gifxwg,I Wrote a Plot Logline for My Fan-Fiction Episode of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gifxwg/i_wrote_a_plot_logline_for_my_fanfiction_episode/,0,"I am an aspiring screenwriter. I considered writing fan fiction for certain shows I liked. I read that screenwriters for TV used to submit and sell spec scripts for TV shows that they want to contribute, which works on a freelance basis. However, I read that producers and agents prefer sampling material to be original because making original material is more challenging (and requires more talent) than working on an established property. However, I want to practice outlining because [my second, recent short film screenplay suffers from a lack of outlining, despite okay jokes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/112FC5cQwHMxKXbMhmzoS3ozXZP9ksXEB/view?usp=sharing).

I found an opportunity for outlining because I think this show should have an episode involving a parody of *Bar Rescue*. Yes, I know that Bar Rescue is a Viacom property (while this show is a Disney property), so even having Jon Taffer as a guest would not feasible at all. I came up with the idea that these characters theoretically work in a bar that rarely has customers, so they sure could try the format of *Bar Rescue*. Of course, it makes more sense for the reality TV visit to collapse not even halfway in the episode. The steps in the outline refer to Dan Harmon's (of *Community* and *Rick and Morty*) story wheel.

**ACT I**

**Beginning and Step 1**: Cleaning gags occur, but Dee notices that the bottles are expired. Therefore, Frank reorders beverages.

**Inciting Incident**: However, an over-zealous bill collector points to over-due payments. Therefore, Mac points to his fist, as intimation. However, the bill collector takes out his phone. Therefore, Charlie opens the expired bottle to douse the bill collector. However, the bill collector gives up.

**Step 2:** Therefore, Dennis points out that the cops may still get involved due to backed taxes.

**Second Thoughts**: However, their brainstorming is interrupted by Charlie watching reality TV. Therefore, Frank contacts a reality TV show to fix the bar and uses an Excel spreadsheet to conspire to skim money from the show to bribe upcoming bill collectors.

**ACT II**

**Step 3**: However, Dennis notices one of the dropped papers about the bank's final notice and needs to keep the bar afloat in the meantime. Therefore, citing the show, Charlie suggests putting cheap liquor in the old, empty premium bottles and using the expired drinks as substitute cleaners.

**Obstacle:** However, the reality TV hosts walk by chewing them out for their background history. Therefore, Dennis pretends to reprimand Charlie and show that cheap booze is from at least up-to-date bottles. However, Dee pulls a what-aboutism and asks the host if he has been a bartender while showing his classist appearance (during the pandemic) on a new station

**Midpoint Twist**: Therefore, the host acts insulted and walks out. However, the local sheriff seizes the property for their debt

**Step 4**:. Therefore, the gang flees the bar to assemble at Dennis' apartment. However, the landlord stands in front of the door to Dennis's apartment. Therefore, Charlie attempts to bribe him with expired booze. However, the landlord accepted the bride, so the gang brainstormed suggestions to make money.

Therefore, they decide to become a shady weed and vape bar.

**Obstacle and Step 5**: However, they lack the funds to start up the bar. Therefore, Frank uses skimmed funds to pay for Mac's Father and his connections to obtain questionable vapes.

**Step 6**: However, they cannot handle the stress of a crowd of customers. Therefore, negative reviews start spreading. However, the reality TV host showed up exposing their illegal activities since he left. Therefore, Charlie throws their expired alcohol at the host. However, the host summons the cops and court officials.

**ACT III**

**Climax**: Therefore, Mac's father's connection attempts to bribe the judge officials, cops, and TV. However, Mac's connections turn out to be working with the cops and getting the group arrested for reselling vapes obtained with illegal funds. Therefore, Mac attempts to resist arrests, but he is easily knocked by one of his father's connections.

**Falling action**: However, the TV host decides to pay to keep the bar financially afloat by paying off the bankruptcy debt to the previous bar and the start-up costs for the entertainment.

**Step 7**: Therefore, the gang obtains minimal sentencing to state prison. However, they are owed legal fines. Therefore, they meet and use Cricket to obtain funds via drug dealing and illegal credit. However, upon returning to the bar, it is run under new management. Therefore, Frank buys the business.

**Resolution and Step 8**: However, it turns out that Frank uses credit cards and loan sharking obtained from the prison. Therefore, the businesses diminished returns due to revenue going to the loan shark (the former bill collector); they remain in debt and legal trouble.

But in the final episode of the second season, he turns into this sort of galaxy brain where he can understand what will happen and what has happened and what might happen. The transformation is subtle and I think the actor carries it well. Suddenly I cared quite a bit for what happened to this child because he seemed like he was caught up in something that was beyond strange and it had broken his brain, but then he moved past it and became enlightened. Seems like a difficult thing to carry off as an actor.

One other thing: doesn't this mean that these people have fixed points in their lives that they have to do every time from now on? Like when they avert the bombing aren't they going to have to do that the next time they go through this life? So they can't really be too far away from that toy shop on that particular day?

television,1ggx1rw,Does anyone remember Celebrity Deathmatch?,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1ggx1rw/does_anyone_remember_celebrity_deathmatch/,28,"To anyone who doesn't, Celebrity Deathmatch was a claymated show that ran on MTV from 1998-2002 in which various celebrities including actors, musicians, athletes, TV personalities, and politicians all fight to the death in various over-the-top ways as well as some fights having unique gimmicks. Not only that, but it also featured real life personalities such as wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin as part of the fictional show's team and real life referee Mills Lane voicing himself. I remember catching the show as a kid, but actually watched the full episodes through reruns on MTV2, or clips on YouTube when I was a teenager. There was also a short lived reboot on the aforementioned MTV2 back in 2006-2007 but some the fights are ""eh"". All the episodes are on Internet Archive, unfortunately the video player on there isn't working. There was also going to be another reboot in the works but this time with Ice Cube being part of the production crew with his own studio, but that was years ago and nothing came out of it.

But speaking of the celebrities, how amazing would it be if any of the celebrities featured on the show (who are still alive today) react to seeing themselves represented on the show.",2024-11-01 03:59:07

Some thoughts:
- Peter Stormare seems like he is trying to be Jack Sparrow, but half-assing it.

- How good is the actor playing T-Bag? Totally commiting to this gruesome character. While having all these weird, almost comical mannerisms. Amazing acting. Just imagine the mood on the set when he is playing those scenes with the rookie CO in the riot episode. Imagining people either vomiting or laughing their asses off....

- The Scofield character is pretty cool. And well cast. Like his intensity/vibe and kindness. Best character since MacGyver when it comes to making kids want to pursue STEM or engineering 😂

- Music is pretty good. Ramin Djawadi was starting to find his form.

- Other than that the series seems pretty uninspired and basic. Lots of bad acting and writing. But yeah, it has its moments.

Watching old TV shows it appears there was much more effort made with opening titles, score and theme and much more time given to closing credits. Sometimes over 1 minute long. It was an inherent part of the show, one of the enjoyable aspects of it.

Now it seems that in our hyper-stimulated society, we can't tolerate anything much longer than a few seconds. And I'm wondering when people started noticing this happening? From my own experience it seems to be mid-to-late 00s.

1)Masquerade (1984), 1 season - A spy show with the premise that ordinary citizens were utilized in each mission in order to utilize their particular skills.

Kirstie Alley was one of the main stars and this was her first role following her breakthrough role in Star Trek II The Wrath of Kahn.  We don't get a lot of these fun spy shows anymore.  I realize this show was made in the height of the cold war which I'm sure influenced its production.  The theme song was sung by Crystal Gayle.  Anybody miss the old time 80s show intros with theme songs?

2)Tales of the Gold Monkey (1982), 1 season - An adventure show set in the South Pacific in the late 1930s clearly inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark and itself was apparently a big inspiration for the Disney cartoon Tale Spin.

Discovery.

> The show, itself a spinoff of Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” features audio descriptions created by a team of nearly all-blind professionals. The streamer partnered with post-production company IDC for the project, leveraging personal insights from the team’s members to ensure the narration of the series was tailored to the needs of blind and low-vision audiences. Leach’s own experience as a blind voice artist informed his creative process in providing fans with key details such as character micro-expressions and visual elements with symbolic narrative meaning.

> “‘The Penguin’s’ audio description project was a first-of-its-kind approach,” says Waibel. “This crew that came together really brought a level of expertise that I think helped take this to a whole new level…they describe things in a way that’s really cinematic and does right by the storytelling.”

> “The contextual details they add into scenes give it so much more texture,” Leach says. “For example, when we’re talking about Penguin’s teeth gleaming in the light…the accentuation, the detail that the show is already giving the visual audience is picked up by our writers and added in such a way.”",2024-10-29 18:58:55

I’ve never been so far away from him,” Bravo said to IndieWire of playing Gabriel. “In Season 1, there was a lot of me in him. But as they made him kind of unaware of his surroundings, of the dynamic, always victimizing and always being completely lost in translation and oblivious to anything that is happening around him and being manipulated by everyone, it kind of became not fun for me to shoot or to see a character I love so much and brought me so much, being slowly turned into guacamole. I really grew apart from him.”

> “I tried for seasons to bring nuances but we don’t have much liberty on set. We cannot change a word or an emotion. They know what they want and we just have to comply,” Bravo said. “It makes me question if I want to be part of Season 5 […] because my contract ends at Season 4. I really want to see if Gabriel gets back to his fun, cheeky, playful, alive self. Because three seasons playing melancholic, sad, depressed, and lost is not fun anymore.

television,1gg9opw,Why do we love to hate some villains but get straight up ANNOYED by others,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gg9opw/why_do_we_love_to_hate_some_villains_but_get/,17,"I am not a movie/tv show expert by any means but I have realized somewhat of a contradiction in my perceptions of villains. I always thought how good a villain was was determined by how much you genuinely hate him/her. I thought ""well if I really dislike them, then the show must be doing something right to suck me into their world, right?"".

However, lately I watched some Kdrama called Penthouse, which is a makjang (it means it's really over the top, exaggerated). I realized that one of the villains I don't just ""love to hate"" but are straight up ANNOYING to watch everytime they're on screen to the point that I don't want to continue watching. This is mostly because the villain (Cheon-Seo Jin) would get away with some ridiculous stuff over and over and it felt dragged out. It felt like not a villain I would be scared of irl because they're dangerous but that I would scared of because they're so damn lucky for some unknown reason - things just go their way. And this lack of logic made me wanna stop watching many times.

My question to you is, if a good hero is supposed to be loved and a good villain to be hated, how do you explain the times when a villain is so hated it makes the Tv show not worth watching? Is that an objectively well-written villain and you're just being overly sensitive or is that genuinely not a good thing to have in the screenwriting world?

EDIT: I am genuinely interested why this post got downvoted (cause it's at zero rn). Like not judging or anything, I just want to understand why to learn.",2024-10-31 08:29:09
television,1ggbw5d,Ross and Friends.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1ggbw5d/ross_and_friends/,11,"I was forced to watch 'Friends' a lot, the series over and over. It was not that I did not like them, it's just Cable sucks and you even want to watch something outside your faves. There was just not much else that's why I gave it up, lol. But with this negativity towards Ross on websites and YT vids got me thinking as I was watching the series all the stuff about Ross' toxic masculinity and homophobia. I hope I am not stepping on any toes. But, here it goes...

This is what I have concluded. This view of Ross must have been bias.  Never had anything against Ross and I don't know why I can't see similar faults in others. Heck, I remember a time where none of them were considered good people in the end. Ross only? Nope. Not by a longshot.

The whole Ross and Rachel were a toxic couple thing, and Monica and Chandler were healthy is not true from my view. Monica is controlling and has severe OCD (the reason why Pheobe left) she also makes regular homophobic comments not only to Chandler like ""Please watch some ESPN"" ""Do you want him to be your guy?"" Or ""Are you telling me you are such and such or that you're gay?"" And not just Chandler, she was also relieved when she found out why Ross was spending so much time in his room with his male friend. Implying she thought that it was homosexual activity.  They vilify Ross for his controlling behavior and promoting ""Toxic Masculinity"" even when he outgrew it, but Monica continued hers. Either people didn't notice this with her, and it was bias, or they were in denial or just jealous of Ross/Rachel. I won't say everyone, though. We are all individuals. And some other examples like HELLO Monica? And even Rachel being part of the problem with using ""girls"" and ""make love"" like insults and calling them not manly enough. Chandler called a male nurse girly before Ross said anything about the male nanny. He even said Ross' detergent was girly. And Ross did not quite understand it, but he heeded his advice.

Monica with all her combined faults will definitely F@ck up her kids, IMHO. At least IRL realistically. If it's a straight boy, he will become an overcompensating pig or if he's gay he will have major issues and most likely won't be able to come out of the closet with her.  Because of her emasculating their father in front of them. Hopefully he won't become suicidal. And then there is this, just how she treats her husband and being obsessed with ""crummies"" and them not being able to decorate their own bedrooms. And everything brought in the house will have to be Monica approved, heaven forfend if they want a cat.  Obviously, Mon and Ross are cut from the same cloth then. Except for the OCD, though. Pheobe also called her ""high maintenance"" and ""shrill."" Once the sparkles in Chandlers eyes have faded because he finally got a girl for the long haul... Yes, I am going to say it - DIVORCE. Mon even said now she was just someone's wife after the wedding. Seems she was just more in love with being a bride than being a wife. I can't see it lasting. If it does it will be toxic. Anyway, I know this is long, but it was a lot to cover. Lol.

ETA: This does not mean I think Ross and Rachel would be successful because they both had their own baggage to work out. This is just a response to the rivalry usually on Mondler fans/supporters ends. Also, I did not add the faults of Ross/Rachel because it does not need to be as it was done to death.",2024-10-31 11:08:37

3. Rush Limbaugh show the tv version  was produced by the same company that did Sally Jessie Raphael and when it came time to renew SJR Rush show was part of the package local stations hated that stipulation but how they got around it was they aired Rush overnight.

television,1gel00k,Mary hartman Mary Hartman ,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gel00k/mary_hartman_mary_hartman/,19,"So I started watching this show, it's from the 70s, it's a primetime soap created by Norman Lear who created some of the most popular comedy shows that aired like All in the Family.  I've been wanting to see this for awhile now and finally got the box set for somewhat cheap.  It's a primetime satirical soap opera that ran five days a week for a couple of years.

This show is very very subversive and way ahead of it's time, It's a very dry but exaggerated comedy series that is part drama and doesn't really have a laugh track.  It's set in the small town of Fernwood that seems to be having a spat of local tragedies, one of the stories happening right now is a family that was shot to death in their own home along with their chickens and goat.  The main character Mary asks who would want to kill a bunch of chickens and goats......oh and the humans.  Another character is surprised to learn that the family had chickens and goats at all.  The humor is really dark at times another episode has Mary turning on the radio and hear that a hostage situation ended in multiple casualties.

If I had to compare it to a more recent show I would say it would be Twin Peaks, if you removed all the supernatural weirdness but kept all the quirky characters you would probably get this show,  The acting is really good and I like the subdued and dark humor the way it weaves it's dry humor.

From what I have read about this show after seeing the first episode all the main networks turned it down because they were both afraid to advertise or sell it to a big audience so Norman Lear sold it to syndication where it gained a cult following and great reviews.",2024-10-29 03:07:45

It feels like Squid game will struggle, its hard to do it so uniqe as the first time since it was so new. Can they surprise us?

And as long as Yellowstone wont be awful its a win, dont expect a lot, but if they surprise and create a perfect finale thats ok with me. Good luck Yellowstone.

Severance- I have no idea what will happen. Maybe s1 was just a set up and things will go wild in s2.

Almost every detail on this show is in Fincher's movie. You might as well watch the movie.

The documentary was like a half-baked, less interesting version of the movie.

They showed an interview with Bryan Hartnell, the guy who got stabbed at the lake with his girlfriend when he was in the hospital. He was so cocky, and self assured in the way he was explaining how he's totally safe in the hospital and no one's going to come after him because there's plenty of people in the hospital.

In the movie, that's exactly how he is portrayed when he's getting tied up, and he's sweet talking Zodiac like he can fool him.

It's just great attention to character detail and the research that went into it. It's all Fincher though. I feel that script in the hands of a less competent director would have been a very mid movie.

Hell, Fincher even found the spot where the actual Lake Berryesa murders happened and built an island in the lake to shoot that scene. The man is a master.

television,1gf42dq,Mindhunter season 2 sucks ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gf42dq/mindhunter_season_2_sucks/,18,"I've been seeing a lot of love for Mindhunter on and off recently  and while I absolutely love season 1, season 2 sucks so much on a level that I'm shocked whenever I see people say ""bring Mindhunter back""

Season 2 sucks for me because:
Holden is underutilized this season. I understand putting the limelight on other characters for their own story arcs (which they botched anyway). But Holden literally has no character arc this season. He just stays as narcissistic and bland throughout the season without ANY development. Nothing interest of note literally happens to Holden throughout the season that drastically changes his character except the first episode. He is roughly the same person he was at the end just as the beginning.

Wendy Carrs relationship makes no sense? I don't get the point of the bowling and brunch scenes with Wendy and her girlfriend. What were those scenes supposed to convey? I get that the end of that relationship mirrors how she's sidelined in her career just like in her relationship. But the brunch and bowling and in-between scenes don't really convey that. They don't convey any kind of emotional development explicitly or easily within Wendy's character, it's just kind of like a random scene.

I'll actually like Tench's story arc however it does feel a bit too repetitive. Tench calling saying he can't come home or has to be late, then his son does something that gradually gets worse, then Tench comes home and his wife says he shouldn't be late again and or they need to move out. Which would be fine but I just wish it was better and more entertaining somehow I'm not so sure how exactly.

The Atlanta Child Killer doesn't tie in thematically nor even emotionally to the main characters. I get that the show is trying to take a look on the discriminated black community at the time but the execution on that also sucks. It does show the corruption of city officials and thus shows the hardships of trying to find the killer with that and the corruption subplots were fine. But there are two issues. Issue one, its hard to directly sympathise with the black community (in the TV show obviously) because there isn't much black characters, the victims, that we follow the pov of directly; this a show centred about the fbi agents of course. But the black characters we do follow specifically one of the mothers with the glasses, is so unflinchingly bitchy especially to Holden that it's hard to like her. Not only is she bitchy she is bitchy that almost feels too stiff like I don't see any ""complex 3d and deep"" emotions with her it just feels like the same exact emotion with every of her scenes. I understand why she is bitchy of course, considering that's it's Holden, that one of her children had just died and her mistrust with the corruption of the city of city officials around her. But it still doesn't mean I like her and I don't spend enough time with her as a character to get invested emotionally beyond that. But why I feel that might also relate to the other main issue.

The other main issue is like I said, I don't feel like the agents even care as much? Obviously we do see them do things and advance the plot but Holden feels just like a blank character who doesn't get as emotionally involved with the case as much. We don't see him change as a character in such a heavy way with the case. 
Which leaves Tench who does change as a character but not directly from the case itself but from having to work a case in general. The actual Atlanta Child Killer case doesn't tie in thematically and emotionally with his own character arc really. 
 But if the main characters of the show aren't as invested in the Atlanta Child Killer case then why should I?

In theory all of these plotlines could tie together somehow and be woven together seamlessly but the execution is just fucking terrible. Like the season is not even good, it's just bad.",2024-10-29 20:05:42

Hope you’re doing well.

  
On Buffy, I feel like the relationship between Buffy and Giles for the first five seasons (until Giles abandoned her) was more engaging and interesting and had more depth than any of her romances.

He is essentially her father and beginning as the rigid, devout tutor for the Watcher’s Council, her relationship with him helped in his growth and vice versa. 

They had a very realistic relationship built on trust, honesty, emotional support and respect and a level of protectiveness and were probably my favorite relationship between characters on my favorite show.

When i see hate on a female character even if i'm not in the fandom i KNOW its the fandom misogyny at work lol i never trust a single scrap of female hate ever in my life, in fact if i'm feeling extra petty i'll go root for her

For every complaint that's probably got real merit, there are five that are jaw-dropping flagrant misogyny and fifteen that sound like good faith on the surface but are uncritically built on misogyny if you poke them.

With *incredibly* rare exception I've been able to use complaints about female and especially sapphic characters as a recommendations guide.

It's pretty fun? It's definitely not what anyone will be expecting from a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea adaptation, it's more like they've taken inspiration from the idea of Nemo's beginnings, then stacked a bunch of stuff on top of it. But it reminds me of the 90s adventure shows like Stargate or Xena. It starts off fairly serious, but gets silly pretty fast. I'm on episode 5 currently and it's already taking the shape of an ""underwater problem of the week"" format.

If you don't take it too seriously, you can definitely have a good time watching this. Turn off your science brain (some of the things they got wrong are legit funny, they're so bad) and just enjoy it for what it is, a silly, large-scale adventure.

Jackie has a fallout with her best friend Shauna, who tells Jackie she should ""leave."" For *no obvious reason*, the other girls gang up on Jackie. Their coach -the **ONLY ADULT** in the room- says ""Nobody is going outside."" Lottie says ""Stay out of it, coach.""

Is **THAT** the writers' idea of creating conflict? I have *no issue whatsoever* with shows killing off any character they want ***as long as things make sense***. I have a few incredibly simple questions: Why does the coach keep his mouth shut after Lottie tells him to stay out of the dispute? Did I miss any breadcrumbs in previous episodes suggesting the girls were slowly plotting a coup against the coach to emasculate him like that? What is anyone's idea of ""leave"" in that situation? It's not a freaking *sleepover*. The cabin is the ***only place*** they've got. But ***somehow*** (!) they forget how one of their friends was defaced and almost got killed by a pack of wolves, and how a bear **JUST SHOWED UP AT THEIR DOORSTEP**.

It seems like some people have such short attention spans these days. They want everything wrapped up in the first few episodes and if it's not, they start complaining about how bad the show is. In my opinion, two to three episodes are enough to know if a show is for you or not. If you're a whole season in and still saying it's boring, you should have dropped it after the first 2-3 episodes.

television,1gczlap,Hellbound season 2 discussion ,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gczlap/hellbound_season_2_discussion/,60,"Massive spoilers basically everywhere in this thread, so if you haven’t seen it don’t even bother opening this.  You’ve been warned. 

The ending was kind of a cliff hanger, the girl with the equivalent of the shinigami eyes (can see peoples deaths for those who aren’t fans of deathnote), makes some predictions that don’t come true and some that do. 

I’m thinking perhaps this was manipulation on her part to get what she really wanted before the world ended, she proved it was true with some examples, and then could basically manipulate almost anyone into anything.  

Originally I thought her not wanting to see her kids ever was because she knew that the event correlated to a mass proclamation of essentially judgment day for the world, with various times, so it won’t be all at once, and she just wanted to put it off as long as possible to let her kids survive for a bit longer. 

Also each person’s visit to hell is subjective, clearly, and I think the only reason anyone was sent back was because they intended to create hell directly on earth, via recruits like the ex chairman.  

What ever random “power” they’re sent back with has a purpose, clearly, and calling it a power is way too generous, more like a curse. 

Ok. So on the baby… it did get sent to hell, so I assume everyone’s being punished along with the whole original sin thing and not anything specific.  The thing with the baby was that it was sent to hell extremely briefly from the viewer standpoint, but as we heard from others, the time is subjective.  Objectively the baby was gone less than a second.  Subjectively it might have been a thousand years and the kids the anti christ…. Who knows. 

All of it does fall pretty closely in line with the Christian faith interpretation of revelations afaik (not that I’m religious, so I might be off here). 

The rapture, afaik is more or less Judgment -> purgatory -> hell or some few ascend to heaven… more or less.  And it’s a mass thing, all humanity, not just seven deadly sin folks.  With everyone gone, god creates a new earth with a new humanity that lacks suffering or death, sounds more or less like quasi heaven, but ask someone aster they’ve been around for 20,000 years. I’m sure they’ll get bored.  

While the point of the show is obviously the political aspect of cult personalities and their impact on society I am curious how they’ll wrap it up without a literally everyone dies situation. 

The only thing missing from this interpretation is where the hell are the angels delivering messaging’s that say in X days you’re on your way to heaven, yay!  Maybe it’s just because it would reveal too much plot wise and be bad for the show, but the webtoon doesn’t seem to have it either, so maybe everyone’s just screwed. But I guess this lines up with theology as well, since god more or less destroys earth and all humanity rapture or not, the odd thing is that it’s god (and some angels), so if that’s where the show is headed, then well, we know the end.  RIP earth.

television,1gbzsjp,Shows like Person of Interest and Fringe really make me miss the days of shows with procedural elements and 20+ episode seasons ,462,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1gbzsjp/shows_like_person_of_interest_and_fringe_really/,146,"I recently finished watching Person of Interest and loved it so much that I would put it up there as one of my favourite shows, alongside prestige TV giants like Mad Men, The Wire, Breaking Bad etc. I'm currently about halfway through Fringe and really loving it as well. 

Honestly my favourite thing about these shows is...how much of it is available to me lol. Over the past few years I've gotten so used to shows having like 6-10 episode seasons (and massive waits in between), that it feels almost weird to open up a season of PoI and Fringe and see that I have more than 20 instalments per season. 

Now obviously some of these episodes are strictly ""case of the week"" and don't always tie in to the main narrative/larger plot line but honestly, I actually like that. It's nice for some of these episodes to just be a well-told one-off where the writers can just give us something self-contained not beholden to moving the main plot forward. More importantly though, they are effective at further developing the characters and creating more of an investment towards them. 

PoI is a great example of this - throughout its 5 seasons it definitely had some more procedural episodes that felt either like filler or just weren't very strong storytelling-wise, but they did a great job of getting you more attached to the characters so that you truly come to care about what happens to them. And I find that to be the same for Fringe as well. 

Another great example is Lost - which might be the ultimate when it comes to ""journey over destination"" and being a show where the characters were so important.

Honestly I'll even be satisfied with 13-episode seasons because a lot of the ""peak"" shows like Breaking Bad, Sopranos, The Wire etc. did just that, and still managed to create unforgettable stories and characters. And I feel like even those shows had episodes here and there that could be seen as one-offs focusing more on developing the characters and the world they reside as opposed to strict plot movement.

Hope you’re doing well.

I wasn’t annoyed or angry (though of course many of you were, understandably so), but Michael Scott on The Office was a deeply flawed character who left me a little confused and upset (as much as you can be on a sitcom, that is) because his actions often directly hurt his friends and colleagues (probably most prominently, Oscar). 

But I’d probably be cool with a guy like that in real life (heck, I am, with some people who come close, but they aren’t as stupid or delusional as Mike) because i know deep down that he means well and he can be quite likable when he’s not trying too hard to be funny or just someone else or just getting in his own way.

The whole show was just so much fun. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was perfect in the lead role, as were the actors in her staff. Not to mention that VEEP has a collection of some of the most creative insults i‘ve ever heard. But what really cemented this series as an all timer for me was the finale and the episodes 
leading up to it. 

*
From here on, i‘m gonna go into the details of the finale. So be warned of Spoilers, if you plan to watch the show by yourself
*

The whole show centered around Selina‘s desperate grasp for the presidency. I felt it was a really fitting conclusion but still a little shocking to see her becoming so obsessed with succeeding in getting back into office, that she basically abandoned the last few prinicples she had in life, resulting in loosing her last few allies and the last people she could have called „friends“, even her own daughter. Her final scene, where she sat down back in the presidents chair and realized, probably for the first time, that she is all alone now was such a perfect bittersweet moment to end her character arc on. And i would‘ve been fine with the show ending right there. But they even topped her final scene with the epilogue 24 years later. 

The epilogue of Selina‘s funeral had so many little moments to round everything up nicely.
Gary‘s farewell to Selina, Andrew secretly popping up at the service, Furlong rolling around Will in his wheel chair, Mike still struggling after decades to look into the right camera, the male guards struggling to open Selina‘s vagina-formed crypt door and the callback to Tom Hank‘s death overshadowing Selina in the news. All these little moments put the icing on the cake of an already perfect ending. 

It‘s been a while since i’ve wachted a show with such a satisfying ending, so i just had to share my thoughts and feelings about it. Now i‘d really be interested how other people think about VEEP‘s finale and the show as a whole. So feel free to share your opinion! ",2024-10-25 14:02:56

I had only seen a few random episodes when it originally aired and it seemed funny enough to revisit. Now I'm about halfway through the final season. Besides the main characters, I can't believe how many guest stars they had in this series! Maybe it's just because I'm watching it almost 20 years late and a lot of these actors/actresses were not as well know back then. But wow... so many!",2024-10-25 03:29:08

But my second favourite moments are those featuring Deirdre O'Connell, playing Oz's mother. Her physicality is really amazing conveying her vulnerability but also her toxicity. 

I really hope that in the coming award seasons that Milotti is nominated in the the Best Actor categories so that there is room for O'Connell to be nominated in the Best Supporting categories. ",2024-10-26 15:23:05

But, my recollection of the backstory from BBT is that Mandy’s parents live in Oklahoma.  No?

They’re in Medford? And can wedge in a Missy storyline?  And Georgie can just leave work? 

It’s bad. Period.

""My dark passenger"" . . . Seriously? I remember Dexter saying that he's got ""demons inside me"". I just find the dialogue really funny atp. The plot moves at a tortoise's speed and most of the time it doesn't even make sense.  Now is it entertaining? Ofc it is. I've watched all 8 seasons and new blood. I WILL be watching the prequel and the new series when it comes out in 2025. 

I think it's just one of those shows you watch to turn your brain off; no thought process required. Honestly there's nothing wrong with that, I get it; sometimes you just want to turn your brain off. It remains relatively inoffensive (except for the endings of season 2, 8, and new blood). I just think it's wrong to call it ""cinematic masterpiece"", when it's terribly average at best. That could just be me responding to the new Dexter love train though. What do you guys think?",2024-10-26 21:53:15

>!At the end of season 1, Emily/Angela is abducted by Hamzad while being held captive by Morgan Bote's goons. However, I can't figure out HOW Hamzad knew her identity and location at this point in time. I understand Bote made a deal with Hamzad to deliver Chase, and to ensure the deal's success, he threatens Chase who willingly surrenders himself to protect his daughter. But I don't see why Bote would need to clue Hamzad in on Emily's involvement in the deal. Doing this would compromise Bote's life long efforts to protect her identity on behalf of Chase (who is essentially an adopted son and who he cares about), and we later learn from Emily herself that Bote is so upset with Hamzad for the kidnapping that this is mainly what spurs him to freeze Hamzad's assets. So how does Hamzad find out if not through Bote?!<",2024-10-26 10:12:01
