indiegames,1esd7yf,New rule: No more developer self promotion posts under guise of asking feedback ,602,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1esd7yf/new_rule_no_more_developer_self_promotion_posts/,146,"Good afternoon r/indiegames! After much deliberation by the staff, we will be implementing a new rule and some posting guidelines to the subreddit concerning post formatting. I am a father to a baby boy who joined the mod team a few days ago. Him less than a week old has left me with very little sleep and typing this on mobile with his assistance.

New rule: No self-promotion under guise of feedback

Game promotion is an integral part of our community, and we want to ensure that it is used properly. Which is why we want to paint a line between acceptable feedback and promotional posts. We‚Äôve created some new guidelines that are as follows: 

**Game promotion:**

Game promotion will always be allowed on this subreddit and we love helping developers show off their unique creations to players! We are of course r/indiegames and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre about! Moving forward promotional posts that contain titles that ask questions will not be allowed. With examples such as ‚Äúwould you play this?‚Äù, ‚Äúshould we add multiplayer to our title before our release date?‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhich camera angle should our game be in?‚Äù whilst having the choices already being implemented. 

We advocate having a catchy title, info about your game, or even something unique that the players of your game will understand. In the comments you are free to post links to your steam page, discord, or any social media. However, in accordance with reddit TOS URL shorteners are not allowed as they are banned.

**Feedback:**

Asking for feedback can assist in helping make games better. As a developer you should already be doing QA testing and playtesting with the members of your community or fans of your game. Your target audience who you want to be testing your game. However, if you genuinely require feedback, we want to support this but ask those who post to do it properly. 

Be specific with your questions and provide information about what you need regarding only game mechanics or game systems. Asking for feedback on promotional material such as Steam Capsule images, store pages, trailers, or website is NOT ALLOWED. 

However, for genuine feedback requests we ask of those that post to use the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù flair and be aware that NO LINKS ARE ALLOWED regarding your own game, whether it be steam, YouTube, discord, or any social medias. All feedback must be through the comments and please make an effort to reply to people in order to prove that you want genuine feedback.

Edit: After further discussion with the other moderators, we decided that If we think a post is made in good faith, and it happens that someone asked for a link then it‚Äôs okay.",2024-08-14 21:25:49

I thought that I should post here as well. With everyone's support, we actually got Letterheads to #2 on the App Store charts for paid word games (only behind Heads Up)! And it's still there! I seriously could not have ever expected that. I'm just so incredibly happy people have been enjoying the game!

But anyway, Letterlike is a roguelike word game that's been compared to scrabble and Balatro! Currently it's available only for iOS but if you have Android, please sign up at the playable link below (you'll be first in line for a code assuming it's possible to give those out!).

I was able to get more codes this morning so please DM me or comment below if you are interested. I am going to give priority to those that had messaged me before on the other subreddits, but I should be able to cover that and more here! Thank you so much! When giving out codes, I sort by old so it's probably best practice to not request one as a comment to another comment but I'll get to you if I can!

Here is a link where you can play the demo:

[https://playletterlike.com/](https://playletterlike.com/)

The game on the App Store is available here:

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/letterlike/id6737422986](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/letterlike/id6737422986)

If interested, some future updates include:

* Accessibility: I have been working on making the game more accessible! I am super grateful for the folks that reached out to me and highlighted some things to fix! Please do not hesitate to reach out to me about any issue at all as I really would love Letterlike to be available for everyone! We have pushed a few updates that I have been told has helped! But I am always looking to make things better. For instance, I'm going to add an extra large mode for bigger fonts.
* Sound and Music: I'm planning to add some sounds and music to the game. I typically play all my games on silent so I missed this but I think it can add a really nice touch with some sound.
* Dark Mode: I plan on implementing dark mode soon. It's close to being ready, but there needs to be a few tweaks here and there.
* More Items and Bosses: Of course, the plan was to always had more items and bosses. I got a couple fun econ items in mind that I think I'll be able to get out soon. And of course, any of these updates will always be made available for free without any in-app purchases!
* No ads or IAP: Letterlike will be ad-free and without any in-app purchases.
* Languages: I have been asked if I plan to release the game in different languages. I don't know how feasible that would be, but I am considering it. But that would be way down the road.

Again, I have a lot of codes right now so DM me or comment below.

Also, amazingly, user /u/[Covnnic](https://www.reddit.com/user/Covnnic/)¬†has made a¬†[Letterlike Community Reddit Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterlike/s/NsAljuuVFQ)¬†that I'd thought I'd mention here! As I mentioned in the other subreddit,¬†I was considering starting an official subreddit but I think that community subreddits are better because people can freely criticize and critique the game. To be honest though, I will probably take a peek every so often heh (or if someone pings me there). But just to get a temperature of what's working and what's not to tweak / fix the game.

I posted twice because I forgot to include an image link. Here it is!

We all want to support games we're excited about by showing our hype to the game devs. But remember, every facet of game development is, more often than not, a job.

Try to be mindful of their times to rest from the game, whether they're programmers, artists or community managers. Don't let your excitement become a whole another job for them by expecting immediate answers and constant conversation from them. Even tho they are the most excited people about the game, development is taxing and burnout is real.

I am making a game set in NYC where a character has stuff to do in the 5 boroughs and I am trying to research what makes the 5 boroughs distinct from each other, in a way that I can show that difference visually.  
I have been to Manhattan, Brooklyn and some parts of Queens myself, the issue I have is that apart from Manhattan that can be very visually different to the rest, I feel like at least, the Bronx, Queens and some parts of Brooklyn can be mistaken for each other for an untrained eye like mine.  
From my research and experience, Brownstone houses are very common in certain parts of Brooklyn, I have also seen that there is an Art-Deco influence in some Bronx buildings.

Is there anything else visually that you would use to describe each borough visually?",2024-11-12 12:35:51

",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1gpddtv/how_can_i_make_my_game_more_interactive_and/,8,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm working on a game with a psychological theme, aiming to help players understand and recover from emotional trauma.¬†

https://reddit.com/link/1gpddtv/video/xaqeugb0tf0e1/player

It‚Äôs called *The Adventures of Bunny and Pig* (Free Demo on Steam now, Screenshots and videos in Steam Store).

But here‚Äôs the issue‚Äîright now, the median playtime is only **3 minutes**.

Here are some quick stats:

    ‚Ä¢	Median playtime: 3 minutes
    
    ‚Ä¢	37% play 10 minutes
    
    ‚Ä¢	13% play 30 minutes
    
    ‚Ä¢	So far, only 22 users have tried it out.

**The Challenge**

Right now, the gameplay is very limited. **Players only click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù to progress through the story,** and I think that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs falling flat. I want to make it more interactive and engaging, but I‚Äôm struggling with how to translate the theme into compelling mechanics.

The process of treating emotional trauma is a bit more complex. In my game, each character would need a lot of time and interaction to heal, unlike games like *Theme Hospital*, where patients can be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù with a single treatment or surgery. This difference has been one of my main challenges as I design the game mechanics.

**Story Overview**

The main character, Pig, is dealing with trauma and trying to break free from it. My hope was that players could help her make decisions that improve her life. But right now, it‚Äôs not really capturing attention, and I think adding a new gameplay mechanic might help.

**Any Ideas?**

Does anyone have suggestions on mechanics that could work for a game about overcoming trauma?¬†

Or have you played any games with similar themes?¬†

I‚Äôm thinking of possibly taking a cue from games like *Do Not Feed the Monkeys* or *Papers, Please*, where players take on a role (like a psychologist) and interact with multiple characters dealing with different issues.

If I can‚Äôt implement these ideas in the current game, I‚Äôd at least like to test them in a future project.

Thanks for any input or feedback‚Äîeverything helps!

[**Blue Prince**](mailto:https://youtu.be/CQFxvMg87Cs?si=fK66aZJOjcAa9Jds) by Dogubomb Inc (Raw Fury)

A very positive preview in Edge magazine a few months back got me very excited about this stylish looking first person adventure game set in a mysterious mansion

¬†

[**Phonopolis**](https://youtu.be/X1d9qp2fog4?si=Y_i8S3Vi4BMDnGlm) by Amanita Design (Self Published)

Amanita Design remain one of my all time favourite developers (Machinarium, Chuchel, Creaks ‚Äì all bangers). Their latest puzzle adventure game is set in a cardboard dystopia and looks absolutely brilliant and unique already. This may be more likely to be a 2026 release but Amanita deserve as many eyes on their projects as they can get‚Ä¶.

¬†

[**Morsels**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPsMAQSjupY) by Furcula (Annapurna)

¬†

[**Star Birds**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pk8aiXMQJU) (Toukana Interactive)

Dorfromantik ‚Äì the village tile placing game ‚Äì was a recent favourite with its chill vibe and thinky strategy. Excited to see what Toukana‚Äôs next game has is store for us ‚Äì currently billed as a star base building and resource management game

¬†

Nighthawks by Wadjet Eye Games

This hotly (and *long awaited‚Ä¶*) vampire RPG adventure from the modern doyens of the adventure game has a steller crew working on it. There is a good chance this will hit in 2025‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

¬†

[**The Stone of Madness**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFgnVdiwMa0) by the Game Kitchen

Real time tactics game set in a Spanish monastery in the Pyrenees looks pretty awesome and comes from the team behind Blasphemous. Confirmed release for January 2025.

¬†

[**Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/) by Megagon Industries

This may still be coming this year though that timing looks increasingly unlikely‚Ä¶.

¬†

[**Cairn**](https://youtu.be/hoHuN34-6jc?si=CFzteHcWuwRvKZaH) by the Game Bakers

While Jusant was good, it seems it has disappointed in purely commercial terms ‚Äì Cairn, a beautiful but hyper realistic game from the Furi team will hopefully prove more of a hit‚Ä¶..

¬†

[**Windblown**](https://youtu.be/i7-XkJcL9s4?si=_cR_n4E1cpvyDc2-) by Motion Twin

Reports suggest that the studio behind the OG development of Dead Cells have come up with an absolute banger of a follow up which is already available in early access. Also worth keeping an eye on [Tenjutsu](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363940/Tenjutsu/) from Sebastian Bernard‚Äôs Deepnight Games ‚Äì Bernard was involved in the development of Dead Cells before going his own way ‚Äì Devolver has already signed on to publish

¬†

[**Mina the Hollower**](https://youtu.be/kdHbJmJjAOI?si=eKjRKCysM0GB7JZB) by Yacht Club Games

Will the new game from Yacht Club finally land in 2025?

¬†

*Others (Updates on some personal favourites):*

¬†

**New Michael Brough Game ‚Äì** Michael has not released a game since pre-COVID but those who follow his Patreon will know he has a few projects in the works with a new game expected to drop next year. He has also confirmed he is working on a follow up to Cinco Paus (one of the greatest games ever made).

¬†

**Coincidence Games (successor to Zachntronics)** ‚Äì we know the team at Coincidence are busy at work. They have already released two physical card games and some education games but a recent report in Edge suggested they were working on a Japanese stock trading game while we know Astra Logical (a new publisher in the thinky game space) is lined up as a publisher for a new game (whether this is the stock trading game we do not know)

¬†

**MDHR** ‚Äì we know the Cuphead team have been recruiting for their new game so hopefully we will at least get a reveal in 2025.

We did! After two years of development, we're excited to announce that the¬†**SuperPosition DEMO**¬†is now available on Steam, and the full game release is planned for¬†**February 25th**!

**So, what is it exactly about?**¬†The main goal in SuperPosition is to reach the exit (the golden tile). This might sound easy, but it‚Äôs actually quite challenging! Often, the exit needs to be activated by arranging crates in the right way or creating a path by pressing the correct buttons. Along the way, there will also be obstacles to overcome. However, these obstacles will be¬†quantum obstacles¬†existing in superposition, meaning they are sometimes present and sometimes not. Each collision with them will cause a quantum collapse, leading to two or more variations of the same level. To complete the game, you‚Äôll need to reach the end of the level in every dimension!

The game features a minimalist yet polished graphic style and a calming soundtrack, perfect for contemplating quantum puzzles.

**As I mentioned, the game is still in development, but there's already a free DEMO on Steam. We would love to hear your thoughts on the idea, game concept, graphics, mechanics, levels, music, and‚Ä¶ basically everything!**¬†**We're a small team of students creating our first big game, so we‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback.**

indiegames,1gnq2i9,Detention And Hijinks Mechanics For Magic Academy Gameplay,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1gnq2i9/detention_and_hijinks_mechanics_for_magic_academy/,1,"I did my best follow the feedback rules, happy to make changes or delete if necessary or be informed of a better subreddit for my topic.

As part of a fun effort to avoid burnout I'm working out a small game that represents a specific experience that could otherwise be found in my larger game project.

I'm making a very complex ""Map & Menu"" game that tries to somewhat provide the experience of playing as a variety of character types from fantasy novels. There's a complete fantasy world that is all tied together that provides immersive context for the more specific experiences. Sort of a strategy/rpg/sim game over all.

One subset of the experience is being a student, or teacher, or potentially headmaster of a magic academy. In the main game you could have anything from a cultivation sect style institution to a wizard school, to a military academy. The specifics of any given institution are emergent from the society in the game that forms the institution.

For the purposes of the downscoped project I'm handwaiving some of the causes of different sturctures/formats of school since you don't have the full game systems and there will be a specific focus on a more Imager Portfolio/Earthsea/Valdemar type academy focused on creating powerful ""arcane"" magic users. So no spellblades per say, no bards, no heralds, no focused military officers, etc.

I know that's a lot of context but it was unavoidable.

I'm working through the specific systems I'd like to represent related to sneaking around, pranks, exploring forbidden places, discovering secret stuff, and the associated risks like detention or punishment detail.

A big thing I need to figure out is how to handle these in a fun way. So you and the crew are out sneaking into the restricted libraries or the storage vaults or going out on the town(I'll be mandating that the procedural academy/ies will exist within major cities and towns and not the countryside.

What happens when you get caught? You'll get some sort of negative consequence, depending on your social status sometimes, but I'd prefer to have an ""alternative experience"" rather than a ""failure experience"".

So I've been considering things like meeting older students who are also troublemakers who have been caught, or attracting the interest of other students, or teachers, or outside groups, who are just tracking who is a go getter of the dubious variety. You might get secret info about cool locations, maybe an explanation of the teacher/staff patrol routes/assignments, offers to work with the shady students or teachers or groups, or training in some of the more ambiguously ethical skills in the game that you'd otherwise have trouble improving.

The ""school experience demo"" will have a job board type thing which people might have experienced in various stories and passes to other towns and outside the school or w/e for good kids but there will also be a punishment detail type thing for the school which can get you sent to new places and also a secret ""naughty students job board"".

There's also a social interaction system that is a subset of the one in the full game and for this topic the relevant part is that teacher relationships or relationships with older students who may or may not have ""student positions of authority"", think head boy or prefect, that can be leveraged to get different punishment experiences than what the common student gets.

This is a game of scheduling, ala Bully or Academagia or King Of Dragon Pass that also has a unique and detailed ""skill check"" system and is mostly played in fancy menus and maybe sometimes ""maps"". Just to clarify the gameplay. You don't really walk around locations with a player character sprite/model in the way you would in Bully or the Harry Potter Gameboy/Gamecube games.

I'm just trying to figure out if there's any interesting options I haven't considered gameplay/thematics wise for making it fun to engage in shenanigans even with the risk of getting caught. The Academagia version of this idea really dropped the ball in my opinion, Bully and the Harry Potter games had okay methods but they have the advantage of a world to move around in.",2024-11-10 02:06:25

indiegames,1gnj5vl,Looking for games with exploration mechanics similar to Valkyrie Profile and Zelda II.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1gnj5vl/looking_for_games_with_exploration_mechanics/,1,"As I've been playing games for many years, I keep getting more and more interested in games that offer different ways for the player to explain their environments. The styles I found most interesting are Zelda II's mix of top-down and 2D side scrolling and Valkyrie Profile's multi-layered 2D exploration. I find it really interesting to have a 2D world where you go into the background and forground to explore. 

The games that I already know of with exploration mechanics similar to Valkyrie Profile are Valkyrie Profile II (duh), Princess Crown, Sword of the Vagrant, Eiyuden Chronicles Rising, Super Neptunia RPG, Astria Ascending, Hero Must Die, Shantae: Risky's Revenge, Tomba 1 and 2, Wonder Boy in Monster World, Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, and Exist Archive. 

Games with exploration mechanics similar to Zelda II that I know of are Phoenotopia Awakening, Elliot Quest, Gargoyle's Quest 1 and 2, Getsu Fuma Den, Super Gun World 1 and 2, Revenge of the Bird King, For the Frog the Bell Tolls, and Adventure Time: Hey Ice King Why'd You Steal Our Garbage. I'm also not sure if the exploration gameplay for Odin's Sphere is like Princess Crown, but I have that game as well. 

If anyone has anymore games like these that they know of, I'd love to check them out. I'm also interested in 2D open world-esque games like Regions of Ruin and Airship Q (not Terraria though). ",2024-11-09 20:29:05

[Promo art Any World](https://preview.redd.it/2v4ceqscjwzd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44b6c9e135a94108670356ea689ee432c7a013a)

**Any World** \- is a charming 3D platformer with an open world that offers players the opportunity to **explore 7 unique locations, each with its own distinctive style** and set of interesting puzzles. In this game, you will take on the role of an alien named Ottis, who must repair a broken portal device and uncover the mysteries of the wondrous planet Emria.

The main schtick of our project is that **each of the seven locations has its own unique visual style**. For example, in the Aquamarine Expanses, you will find two parts of the location, both rendered in a pixel art style, where most objects and characters are **2D pixel sprites**. In the Sandy Ridge of Sorrow, you will find yourself in a retro environment, reminiscent of games from the **2000s**, and so on.

**At the end of 2021**, I finally **started working on my idea**, even though the platformer market was oversaturated. I still wanted to create something unique, cute, pleasant, and most importantly, my own. However, there were many aspects I didn't understand at the time, and I even thought of abandoning the project due to its complexity. **But in early 2023**, I managed to assemble an excellent team. Our team consists of talented people of different ages and backgrounds: there are students, seasoned programmers, a former journalist, and true game lovers who aspire to become game designers. Together, we were able to define the key gameplay and artistic features of the game, from Ottis's main weapon being a glove with elemental modules, **to the game having 7 contrasting styles in one.**

Any World will be available **only on PC for now**, but in the future, we plan to port the **game to consoles** as well.

We are actively managing the project's social media channels and already have a page on Steam, where you can follow our progress. Moreover, we plan to release a free prototype of the game in the near future, so you can try out our project.

***BlueSky:*** [https://bsky.app/profile/anyworld3d.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/anyworld3d.bsky.social)

We are confident that Any World will provide players with a wealth of **positive emotions and exciting adventures** on the colorful planet of Emria!

Any World is a unique product that will allow all platformer enthusiasts to immerse themselves in the pleasant nostalgia of their childhood games, and thanks to the diversity of styles, everyone will find something for themselves. Don't forget to add the game to your Steam wishlist to be notified of any future updates.

Finally to the point of putting together the steam page for a game that has been in the works for awhile and I wanted to get some advice on naming. I've read a few different posts from people about what makes a good name (i.e. uniqueness, identifiability, key game mechanics) and before pulling up the steam page wanted to get some feedback and see if the chosen name lands.

The current name is **Parchment: Tales of Rise & Ruin**

I'm a bit worried its too long so also considering **Parchment: Rise & Ruin** or just **Parchment** (though the last I am worried becomes far too generic. The game is a RPG x Grand Strategy Game heavily inspired by board games with the key theme being persistence of decisions and the ability to play continuations of previous games (starting a new character in an existing world in which your previous character becomes a NPC). Including the screenshot of the working steam art for people to get the theme of the game:

Just launched my first game Devil's Words - born from an unhealthy Netflix binge of ""Devil's Plan"" and 7 sleepless nights of coding with Claude AI.

# What's the Game?

* Get a theme (like ""Countries"" or ""Animals"")
* Get a bunch of letters
* Find all theme-related words
* Each letter must be used exactly once
* Brain starts hurting around level 20

Currently, my entire player base consists of me, my mom, and probably the App Store reviewer. Would love to get some more user feedback.

I've reached a point where I want to start getting mass feedback for my game to make sure it's headed in the right direction, rather than just from friends and family. Is a steam demo the way to go about this or will people expect a demo to be more of a finished product? My main concern about this is that while the gameplay loop is complete and fleshed out, I have a lot of placeholder artwork that i've made that won't be reflective of the final product (as you can see in the image).

indiegames,1gl344o,[Game Intro] First game idea - Just sharing the concept,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1gl344o/game_intro_first_game_idea_just_sharing_the/,3,"*Good morning (or whenever this meets you),*

Hopefully I won't run into some regulations issues. I just want to share the game idea I started diving into as a first game ever to be developed.

**Game Overview**

I have this concept of the game called Timeless Treasures (naming in progress but I kinda like it). It would be a point-and-click adventure/puzzle in a pixel-art style. You are playing as a time traveller and the main storyline takes you through some ancient eras. I was thinking: Egypt, Rome, Greece, China and Mayans possibly. Each scene is like a living image (something like Hidden Folks but cartoonish pixel art) filled with relics, puzzles and hidden objects. Your goal is to find the listed items, solve puzzles and push the storyline further.

**The Core Mechanics**

The core of Timeless Treasures is exploration and puzzle-solving. You'd gather some items from the scene and then can use those later on. I want each interaction to feel purposeful and true to the era. On top of that there is also an idea of a quirky radio host named Tim(e) Turner, who provides hints, historical fun facts, and dad jokes. I'd love to make it both entertaining, funny but at the same time possibly educational - like gathering the lore scrolls with the factual info about the era you're in.

**Soo..**

I'd love to have a discussion and hear your thoughts on the idea. I of course ponder on it for a while and have the scope creep list really expanded - but keeping it just aside for ""later"".

*Thanks for hearing me out :-)*   
*Cezary from Memobots Games*



**TL;DR:** Timeless Treasures is a time-traveling point-and-click adventure where players explore historical eras like ancient Egypt and Mayans World to find hidden artifacts and solve interactive puzzles. With each scene, you‚Äôll interact with the environment to reveal secrets, guided by a quirky radio host named Tim(e) Turner. Just sharing to spark discussion :-) ",2024-11-06 16:55:31

We‚Äôd like to gather opinions and feedback about the name of our game. Our original intention was to combine *Master* and *Piece* to convey the idea of ‚Äúa master controlling chess-like pieces (chess master)‚Äù and ‚Äúbuilding a deck of ‚Äòmasterpiece‚Äô quality.‚Äù

However, we‚Äôve received some feedback that *Master Piece* might primarily evoke *Masterpiece* or *Master-piece* (as in a work of art) and that it can be difficult to find our game online. To make the title more unique and improve its searchability on the internet, we are currently exploring solutions.

To aid in this process, we‚Äôd like to ask English-speaking users for feedback:

1. When you hear the name *Master Piece*, what meaning or impression does it give?
2. Would adding a subtitle to *Master Piece* help make the title more unique and improve searchability online? For example, something like *Master Piece: Origin* or *Master Piece: Odyssey.*
3. Do you have any other suggestions for a better title or subtitle that could enhance our game‚Äôs name?",2024-11-06 08:44:28

I created a card game in the style of Hearthstone using React with a Node.js server and a PostgreSQL database. In the game, you can build card decks and play online against other players. There are also challenges, and by completing them, you earn gold that you can use to buy card packs.

Since I'm using a free server plan, the server goes to sleep during periods of inactivity, so you might see an error about the server being unavailable when logging in. Usually, just waiting a minute and trying again will allow the server to start up.

I just came out with a new personal finance themed game called Wealth Project and would like some feedback from you all! It‚Äôs a short (one-hour) visual novel and point & click game with mini-games and puzzles that guide players through the basics of wealth-building and financial literacy.

# Why I Created This Game

I‚Äôm a huge fan of personal finance books like *Millionaire Fastlane*, but I realized there aren‚Äôt many games that actually *teach* financial principles in a fun, interactive way. So, I decided to develop *Wealth Project*, a game where players can explore different career paths, make important financial choices, and learn smart money management skills‚Äîall within an hour!

# What You‚Äôll Find in Wealth Project:

* **Interactive Story**: Choose your path and make decisions that shape your financial journey.
* **Career Exploration**: From merchant to farmer, explore how different career choices affect wealth-building.
* **Educational Mini-Games & Puzzles**: Learn practical concepts like budgeting, goal setting, and net worth calculation through fun gameplay.
* **Accessible and Affordable**: The game is just $5 on Steam, making it an affordable introduction to personal finance concepts.

I‚Äôd love to get feedback from this community on both the game‚Äôs educational content and gameplay experience. As a solo developer, your thoughts mean a lot and will help me improve future projects!

Thanks for checking it out at Steam and feel free to ask me anything about the game or development process. Happy to chat with you all!",2024-11-03 14:48:32

* **Leaderboards**: Compete against other players and aim for the top spot on every level! üìà
* **Immersive Stealth Gameplay**: Use stealth, agility, and strategy to conquer each level and escape with the loot.

I‚Äôd love to hear feedback from the community and any suggestions for future updates. Also, if you enjoy the game, please consider adding it to your wishlist or spreading the word! üôå

Hello friends, I would like to get your opinion on something. I will talk honestly. A few days ago, I released a rally game on Steam. You can find it in the comments. I thought people loved the demo when they played it, because there was a high demand. Then I released the game, but I received a lot of bad comments. Of course, I took the criticism into consideration, but I did not update them. I had to rewrite the system for the game, so I remade the game trying to stay true to its roots. Now they can play it with either high resolution or pixelated retro look. When I finished the update, I wanted to get your opinion. I really liked this project, but I didn't expect it to be criticized so badly. Also, I had to change the system to add arm support. Do you think it's better than on Steam?",2024-10-31 16:08:08

I‚Äôm building a gaming platform and plan to have indie games on it

I‚Äôm looking for for pixel games, not computationally heavy, and all possible genres.

What‚Äôs in it for you: you don‚Äôt pay me anything!  You guys have worked hard enough, but the only thing I can promise you nice folks is a marketing boost just by the virtue of being on my platform(since I‚Äôm going to market my platform anyway) and ofc access to consumer data - should I myself become successful.

If you like what I said or have more plans on a better collaboration- I‚Äôm all ears ! Please DM me.

I‚Äôm rolling the dice on this one.

Very proud to announce **Rogues Don't Cry** is out on Steam now!  

My name is Olivier, I'm a solo dev from Canada. Been working on my passion project which is inspired by games like Age of Wonders and tons of roguelikes like Crawl Soup and some RTS thrown in there. 

The result is maybe a new genre, a quick pace roguelike with army building and real time combat. This is really an experimental game and I took a lot of risks making it! Especially since the difficulty is a bit high and it's aimed at experienced gamers.

Hope you try it and definitely leave feedback!

I've seen so many post-mortems on Reddit and always wanted to write one of our own‚Äîso here we are.

# How It Started

We‚Äôve been building *DIESELDOME* for two years but until the last 5 months we only had a 3 member team.These last 5 months, we finally got some help and focused on the game. Our goal was to launch a demo for Steam Next Fest to see if people would enjoy what we‚Äôre creating here.

We started with our first game[ trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn8mc4A61Hk), created with an amazingly talented editor,[ Saimizz on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/saimizz). We posted it on Reddit across various subreddits, and that week, we gained around 800-900 total wishlists!

https://preview.redd.it/mpqoy5k9lyxd1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2005ed372e827ec7924113f7712768c936787b

We put out a few devlogs after that, along with YouTube Shorts videos to go with them, and got as active on Reddit as we could. This gained us around 300-400 wishlists over those months. We couldn‚Äôt put out as much content as we wanted, though, since we needed to focus on development and design to make it to Next Fest.

# A Month Before Next Fest

After spending all our budget and savings on additional help with development and design, we were left with almost no money but had an almost-ready game demo! With some help from our families and our last budget, we hired a **great** PR firm to work with us for the duration of the Next Fest. We‚Äôd been active on the HTMAG Discord for a while, and found them while exploring other devs' experiences with PR and marketing firms. Thanks to their supportive approach toward indie games, we managed to work with them on a small four-digit budget.

We knew we wanted to make a big impact at Next Fest to show people what we‚Äôd built so far. Our hope was to gain the attention of a good publisher and take the game to the level we‚Äôd all dreamed of.

Our next step was to create a compelling gameplay trailer to showcase as much of the game as possible. Once again, we teamed up with the amazing editor Sai, and soon had our demo launch trailer ready.

In the meantime, we built a mailing list of influencers, used YouTube and Twitch as resources, and tried to reach out to as many people as we could. Although we had a low positive response rate, we‚Äôre incredibly grateful that some people went ahead and made videos about us! We‚Äôll be forever grateful to them!

Our PR firm focused mainly on media outlets and PR activities since our budget was so limited. Most influencers, apparently already had paid sponsorships (which we couldn't do anyway) during Steam Next Fest because of the high demand.

# Week of Next Fest

The big day was here! I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and I couldn‚Äôt eat! The media embargo held by our PR firm was lifted, and soon we had YouTube channels and many websites sharing our gameplay trailer. It was amazing to see the websites we grew up reading now sharing *our* game on their platforms‚Äîit was such a thrill.

We received extensive coverage from many sites, including IGN, Gamespot, Rock Paper Shotgun, Game Rant, and more. In total we were covered by more than 85 sites, youtubers and streamers. On the first day, we gained around 800 wishlists, and people started joining our Discord, bringing tons of feedback and a substantial amount of new gladiators! Each day after, we‚Äôd search for ‚ÄúDieseldome‚Äù on Google and YouTube to see if anyone was writing articles or creating new content about us.

We put out a few devlogs after that, along with YouTube Shorts videos to go with them, and got as active on Reddit as we could. This gained us around 300-400 wishlists over those months. We couldn‚Äôt put out as much content as we wanted, though, since we needed to focus on development and design to make it to Next Fest.

Our goal was to reach 5,000 wishlists and put out a solid demo, and as of yesterday, we‚Äôve hit 5,770 wishlists! We‚Äôre incredibly excited to be here and can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs to come.

https://preview.redd.it/aahcxd0elyxd1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ce6d615351b9c31ec0636595ae7ab8f949f6aa

# What We Have Learned

Setting deadlines was essential for us, and targeting the Steam Next Fest for organic growth proved very successful, especially given our limited marketing budget. We also had to restrain ourselves to focus on making the demo both beautiful and enjoyable.

Being active on Reddit, YouTube, and Discord was crucial, even though we weren‚Äôt 100% perfect at it. Working with a PR firm really helped as well‚Äîeven if we‚Äôd made the best game with the best visuals, it wouldn‚Äôt have gained the attention we wanted without them. This was a valuable experience for us.

# What‚Äôs Next

We hope to keep sharing what we‚Äôre building with all of you, attract some publishers, and create more content, especially now that we have a playable demo! We‚Äôre incredibly excited for what‚Äôs next.

Thank you, everyone, for reading our story. Feel free to ask any questions‚ÄîI‚Äôll do my best to answer them to the best of my ability.",2024-10-30 21:10:28

I have a playtest on itch available if anyone wants to play it. I plan on adding a more robust combat with phases, I was looking at some older games for inspiration and found **Crossed Swords** for the neo geo and I came up with a plan to do something like this and a mix of **For Honor.** I would like to make this into a quality arcade game something with replayablitiy maby some rouge type gameplay.

Hope you guys good. I just wanna know your feedback about the minimap design between two shape triangular and square. My partner mentioned that the triangular design complements the other interface elements, but I don't like how it extends toward the bottom of the screen.

imgsli url: [https://imgsli.com/MzEyNzI0](https://imgsli.com/MzEyNzI0)

About the concept: It's an Early Access 4vs1 co-op horror - survival game, developed by just two people. It has unique skill and perk systems. You're able to transform a bat and chasing & attack the creature when you complete the ritual. The game has a theme similar to Dead by Daylight, but it's not just about being hunted, dying, or fighting to escape. You can also perform a ritual, transform into a vampire, and become the hunter, chasing down your monster friend. When your monster friend catches you and takes you to the nest, you don't die. Instead, a new experience begins for you, and you continue as a monster. The dynamics of the game can change rapidly.

Thanks a lot **<3**
