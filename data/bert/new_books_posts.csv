books,1gmfyga,"Weekly Recommendation Thread: November 08, 2024",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gmfyga/weekly_recommendation_thread_november_08_2024/,47,"Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

____

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

____

All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.

If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

I didn’t choose it specifically with the American election in mind, but reading it now felt coincidentally relevant. One thing that stands out across the book—and in much of WWII history—is that Hitler’s horrific actions didn’t start overnight; the Nazi rise was a gradual, chilling progression. Vladek’s story captures this slow build-up, where the early, smaller aggressions against Jews steadily grow, culminating in the full horror of the Holocaust.

I’m not saying the future of American government will mirror the events in Austria, Poland, and elsewhere under the Nazi regime because I don't want to diminish the severity of those times. But history has a way of repeating itself, and I want to stay aware of unsettling patterns we might see emerging.",2024-11-13 05:02:29

Tell me the book and tell me why

I’ll start 

I’d pick A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. It’s just too graphic and emotionally draining to watch on screen. From what I’ve heard, Yanagihara turned down several offers to adapt it because of the changes people wanted to make, and she felt it needed to stay true to the book, exactly as it is. Honestly, I don’t even know how a movie or series (especially a movie) could do it justice. The story isn’t built around a single conflict or goal—it’s more like a series of traumas, with no clear resolution or purpose beyond showing suffering. Not sure if that makes sense, but yeah, that’s my take.

Or the trial, which is the reason I wanted to read it (I'm interested in legal dramas). Or it if has something to do with the relationship between father and his young daughter, Scout (the narrator).

Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a widow who does an outstanding job not only as a lawyer but also as a father. He has great compassion, wisdom, and a strong sense of moral that he has tried to also instill in his kids. As you read the book, you see him again and again teach his kids that you gotta be brave and do the right thing even if almost the whole town is against you.

I quite enjoyed the relationship between Scout and her dad and starting to think that has been a big reason the book holds a special place for me. And wonder if there are other parent-child relationships that well-read posters like yourself found memorable from your readings?

To be clear, they don't have to fictional or positive. Terrible relationships are sometimes even harder to forget. So please share any such relationships you recall vividly, and if you can, say what it was about the relationship that you found unique or memorable.",2024-11-13 09:13:09

But then one single hope has flickered. Frank Poole's body, which many thought was dead for a thousand years, has been found in the frozen reaches of the galaxy.

He is then brought back to conscious life and has been readied to continue the journey that was terminated by HAL a thousand years ago. And he knows that he can't proceed with this without Dave Bowman. But right now he must find out the terrifying truth of what both Bowman and HAL have become within the monolith.

So here in the fourth, and final, book of the Odyssey series we make the very big jump through millenniums instead of just years! And into the far flung year of 3001! This final installment (like the third) is also very decent. That adventure aspect is still pretty much there as it was in the last one, and enjoyed it very much.

One thing I've noticed in the final two books, and it was brought to my attention by someone in the comment section of my previous post on ""2061"", that Clarke has put in a lot of emphasis of possible technology in the future. Honestly this doesn't really bother me at all, though some might find it a bit annoying.

Sure, both ""2061"" and ""3001"" may not be as profound as the first two books, they're still enjoyable in my opinion. And now that I've completed the series it's time to get into some novels by Dean Koontz! ",2024-11-13 03:11:16

It makes me think that the only positive thing is that it was written by X, not that the book itself is good, that the title isn't even interesting or has to tell you anything.

I just thought it was kind of interesting and maybe even a sort of trend? The Thirteenth Tale by Dianne Setterfield, The Hazel Wood by Melissa Albert, Starling House by Alix Harrow, A History of Wild Places by Shea Ernshaw, Daisy Darker by Alice Feeny (sort of). 

All of the books have a similar Gothic vibe, and I believe at least three of the fictional authors were described as writing some sort of twisted fairy tales or disturbing stories for children. 

It seems like such a specific trope to randomly encounter multiple times without seeking it out. Was The Thirteenth Tale the start of the trope and then others were inspired by it maybe? ",2024-11-12 03:42:48

books,1goyog0,"The only ""meh"" review you will ever read for Malazan Book of the Fallen - 7/10",97,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1goyog0/the_only_meh_review_you_will_ever_read_for/,150,"Last year I started a search for the most Epic fantasy series ever written. A broad interpretation brought a broad list of series, but I decided on *Malazan Book of the Fallen* becuase it was advertised as super dense, complicated with politics and war, with prose bordering on literature-quality.

And boy was that all true.

I sort of enjoyed my 400 hours of reading (and listening to the magnificent Michael Page's audiobooks) of this 10 book series. I found, both before and after reading, that there were 2 camps of people when it comes to Malazan: People who think it is exceptional, and people who did not finish the first or second book. 

Well I finished it and I thought the whole experience was maybe not worth the time.... But I did enjoy many aspects of it... but even after I'm done I don't understand a lot of what the large plotlines were... Anyway here is the good and the bad from maybe the only person who thinks the entire thing was ""meh"":

***Pros***

1. There are some truly excellent fantasy elements to this story. There are gods. There are heroes. There are villains. There is magic. There is humor. There is tragedy. Like a LOT of tragedy. Anyone who likes fiction will be able to find stuff about these books they like.

2. A wide cast of characters that a reader can draw favor to. I can't imagine reading these books and not liking a handful of people.

3. The world is extremely complete. The author is an anthropologist, and it shows. Everything has history in these books: cities are ancient, and there is proof. There are flashbacks to the city when a different intelligent species lived there. Same with the land.

4. The military campaigns that took up a book length of reading were really good. The Chain of Dogs in the second book was some of the most exciting reading I've done.

5. Some of the deaths and battles were legendary. Don't want to spoil anything but there are some legendary scenes by anyone's standards.

6. There are some fairly unique things about Malazan that are just super fricken cool. There is a sword that is itself a world and captures the souls of the slain to pull a wagon away from Chaos itself.

***Cons***

1. The world is complex. Too complex for me. I read 10 books and I still don't understand some major plotlines (why did this god do that? Why did he want to?). Before beginning the series I read somewhere that the author wanted a series that you could reread and get just as much enjoyment out of it as the first time, and that it didn't lose that magical feeling that a book series can capture. I actually think if I were to re-read the series I would enjoy it more, but I absolutely do not have 400 hours to do that again lol.

2. It feels like some things are *deliberately* confusing for literally no other reason than to be confusing. Names of characters are super similar. Often a new POV will start with something like ""her hands were shaking in the cold, for the windows remained open for the breeze..."" and he won't tell you who the F he's actually taking about for a paragraph or two. Sure he sprinkles in some details sometimes that you'll remember ""oh it's cold in THIS location because THIS magic happened 5 chapters ago"" and you're suppose to remember that minute detail from 10 hours of reading ago.

3. The prose is extremely dense. I usually listen to books at ~1.5 speed. I listened to books 8 and 9 at 1.2 speed and quite frankly it was far too fast. I listened to important parts at 1.0 and the entire 10th book at 1.0. The plots, subplots, and major story arcs are complex already. Throw in some actual English literature and it get's super super difficult to go through quickly. My favorite quote from the book actually is a great example of this:

>As if true honesty belonged to solitude, since to be witnessed was to perform, and performance was inherently false since it invited expectation.

Stuff like this that you could just sit and think about for half an hour.... and it's page after page after page of this stuff! Definitely not for me, although this is just a preference and not an actual complaint.

4. There are plotlines that just don't matter at all to the story (as far as I can tell, I could be wrong, but see CONS 1, 2, and 3 lol). Like the series could have very easily been 1 book less and been just as good or better.

5. I don't understand why every character deliberately withholds information from others, and thus deliberately withholds information from the reader. Many many times there will be 2 characters in a mini-arms race of trying to figure out what the other knows about a mutually held goal and the characters will not say what they know. They will make implications of things they know that would reveal the least information possible to the other person. I have no idea why this distrust of people in the same group/army/race is such a huge theme in these books, and I honestly assume it's just the author being withholding for the sake of it. I am yet to discover a reason why Quick Ben doesn't tell anyone his plans, etc.

6. Characters are continually introduced so deep into the book that I assumed they were not important and were going to die off. But no, the character introduced in book 9 plays a  foundational role in book 10.... I just can't keep the 100s of people in my head!

***Overall***

Some truly exceptional parts in an extremely complex (both literally and narratively) world that nearly demands a reread for a basic level of understanding. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other books out there that I can spend 400 hours on that I have more confidence will be easier, more fun, yet just as enjoyable to read. To give a great example of all of the above, I present my favorite comedic non-spoiler scene, complete with as much context as the author gives from the book Midnight Tides (the 5th book in the series where we are on a new continent will all new characters lol):

>As they walked, Tehol spoke. ""...the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences.

>""I know what you're thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value - they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. 

>""Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labour, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labour and its product be- come the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison- but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value?

>""And so you ask, what's your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!""

>""I'm sorry, master"" Bugg said, ""but what was your point?""

>""I forget. But we've arrived. Behold, gentlemen, the poor.""",2024-11-11 18:05:19

books,1gp1fep,The Lost Bookshop by Evie Woods,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gp1fep/the_lost_bookshop_by_evie_woods/,13,"The Lost Bookshop is an interesting one; I picked it up on a whim (more precisely, because I liked the title and the cover), and was charmed by it for sure! One of these books that really feel like it was both written by and for book lovers. Which is - in my eyes - it's major draw. Recommended for those who love books enough they can get interested in their history, and find it easy to believe that books could whisper to you once you put them down.

Only vague spoilers of story vibes ahead!

**Genre:** I do like the genre of magical realism this is, although found it a bit frustrating that until the VERY end of the book, the characters blithely ignore that magic is happening! Maybe that means there was a bit too much realism in my magic here 😆

**POV:** The book does suffer from having three points of view to tell a story, with only one of these three characters feeling like a main character. The other two were kind of around, if you know what I mean... they were supposed to be connected, but even that connection felt tenuous, relying (imo) too much on the magic that none of them were acknowledging. I did like how the author picked up different serious themes through all of their stories, but the difference in how important one single viewpoint felt compared to the others carried through most of the book as a result.

As an aside, my favorite character was not among the 3 POV characters, but might be argued to be the real main character. Which is very interesting to me! But I can't talk in more detail about that without getting REAL spoiler-y.

**Feelings on the ending:** I've not been reading books just for the fun of reading in a while, and I seem to have developed an overly critical view on endings, often feeling like a story resolves too easily. Felt the same about The Lost Bookshop! Nothing was ruined by that feeling, but it left an aftertaste.

Would love to hear your thoughts, readers! If you have read other books that felt like they were written for book lovers, drop them in the comments as well!",2024-11-11 19:55:46

It took me down a memory lane where Sidney Sheldon was a huge part of my teenage years. I loved diving into his books—they were just crafted so exceptionally well, with gripping plots, intense suspense, and those signature twists that left me reeling every time. Few authors can match that blend of drama and intrigue, and Sheldon knew exactly how to keep readers hooked from start to finish.

Some of my favorites are *Nothing Lasts forever* and *The Best Laid Plans*. Sheldon’s characters, especially the leading women, were always captivating. They were powerful, resilient, and clever, even if they did all seem to be both beautiful and brilliant. But even with that, his storytelling made these characters feel so real and unforgettable.

I thought the first 80% was just okay. Xishi was really just another annoying FMC to me. My biggest complaints are the ending because WTF?

(Zhengdan deserved the world and I would have loved to see more of her. What a queen!)


Fuchai SHOULD have been Xishi's real lover. It could have been a beautiful enemies to lovers romance. Xishi seemed to understand, after a while, that war is just terrible for both sides. There is no right and wrong. The Yue see the Wu as monsters, but the Wu see the Yue the same way. Both sides do terrible things.
Fuchai clearly seemed to genuinely love her. They actually share so many passionate moments, and friendly times, that I really thought they were end game. He even offers to leave his kingdom so they can just live together free of worries and politics. WTF DOES FANLI EVEN OFFER? That man pushed her to complete a dangerous mission, and would only be with her AFTER HIS DUTY IS DONE? BRUH

HOW is there any comparison? 10 weeks with Fanli, no kisses or intimacy, no passion really. No sacrifice, no declarations of love, no gifts of kindness. I felt 0 chemistry between the two of them.

I cannot believe she did not understand her feelings before straight up murdering Fuchai... And then after a good little crying sesh, she is ready to find her one true love (that, again, she has never kissed or even mentioned their love for eachother explicitly)?

Okay. At this point, I am angry that Fuchai was dealt such a horrible end. But at least we get a happy ending for Xishi and Fanli right?? haHA. 

Oh what an ominous note, it probably means nothing ... oh how weird King Yue's other spy got executed by the KING for being a spy... weird but I can't wait to see Fanli!
I have this really weird feeling I am being watched... it's fine I will be with Fanli soon!
(Am I really to believe this girl is smart enough to take down a kingdom?)

And then MURDERED? That is absolutely ridiculous and where the hell is her ESCORT? Rui is just nowhere to be found even though he KNOWS she is in probable danger?

THEN WE GET INTO SOME WEIRD SPIRIT CRAP where she can haunt people's dreams. That was just random and dumb. Absolutely no mention of anything like it until it was thrown into the ending. 

So she waits. For this guy who only kissed her in his dreams after she was murdered. For the guy who didn't sacrifice anything for her, so that he could do his job. For the guy she knew 10ish weeks. For the guy who knew she was in trouble but couldn't take time away from his job to come see her after she finally finished her job and allowed the Yue to take down the Wu. Yes... a note should suffice! 

What a terrible, annoying ending. It was unexpected in a bad way.

Please tell me I am not the only one here....

books,1gott5m,I Hope This Finds You Well,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gott5m/i_hope_this_finds_you_well/,7,"I got this  from the library because I thought I saw it in a thread about funny books.

 I was expecting something very fluff and light. I did not expect it to be as riveting as it was!  I really loved the premise of being able to know what everyone thinks about you and being able to get a peek inside the curtain of people’s lives and thoughts. Probably because I am by nature a nosy person and always want to be a fly on the wall in certain people’s lives. 

1. It kept me hooked! There were a lot of twists and turns that made me want to find out what was really going on.

2. It really painted a good portrait of someone with anxiety. 
How anxiety doesn’t just affect how you interact with people but also how self absorbed it makes you! Thinking everything has to do with you, you’re the center of the universe. There were plenty of things that MC thought was about her and I wanted to shake her and say “Not everything is about you! Other people have their own things going on! 

3. While it wasn’t quite as laugh out loud funny as I anticipated, it was still funny and MC’s voice was super dry and sarcastic which I loved.

One thing I didn’t care for- the ending was happy and everything was tied up in a neat little package with a bow, while that made me feel good realistically I don’t think that would have happened in a story like this. 

I was also able to predict some of foibles that were coming, except for one really blew me away.  

This was a debut novel and I’m really impressed by it. Has anyone else read this? What did you think? ",2024-11-11 14:45:39

Are you for or against this?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gpkdyk/the_character_collects_information_that_is_not/,20,"Lately, I've been reading a certain author who liked to take a break from the plot in books and give the character unnecessary informatics. I will give examples from two of her books so that you understand what I mean when I say that the information is unnecessary in the books and you understand the essence of the question.

1. The book ""Bolotnitsa"". The genre is Folklore horror. The character arrives in the village. The girl, before starting any groundwork for the plot, begins to remember useless horror stories that are needed only for the atmosphere. There were 3 horror stories, quite long. Then the plot began to happen, father went to the city, and mother was stolen by a kikimora. And she reads the notes and then listens to the old woman's stories. All this is necessary to explain what kind of monster, BUT we already know this from the plot. They explained to us that there is a well because of which kikimira gets out and gave all the explanations about her essence. And the notes only explain that the headman lived in this house, about whom we have already been told in conversations.

2. The book ""Cat's Head"". The genre of Folklore is horror. At first there was a plot, but then there was a break in the middle again. There was no plot all through the middle, but the character collected stories about mysticism from the mouths of the villagers, which are long again, sometimes something mystical happened to him, but that's not the point. Stories about mysticism are longer than the pages with the plot. At the end, the plot started again.

That is, in both cases, unnecessary information in the form of stories, notes and horror stories is simply useless for the plot. This is information for the atmosphere and nothing more. Personally, I can't say if this is bad or good for the book, but I want to hear your examples and answers about this question.",2024-11-12 13:12:01
books,1go8ntr,My Favourite Dystopian Novel: Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler,384,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go8ntr/my_favourite_dystopian_novel_parable_of_the_sower/,68,"I have been a big fan of dystopian novels since my late teens, and currently, there seems to be more and more people reading/writing them than ever. As such, I wanted to take the time to make an informative post about my absolute favourite dystopian novel ever that I believe was truly ahead of it's time and is criminally under-read by the populace.

So, if you're looking for a dark, thoughtful dystopian novel, I highly, *highly* suggest you try **Octavia E. Butler's** *Earthseed Duology*.

The first book is titled *Parable of the Sower* and the second is titled *Parable of the Talents*. Despite the titles, these texts very much critique organised religion, religious fundamentalism, and more specifically Christianity. While being written in '93 and '98 respectively, they remain more relevant than ever, set in a post-pox (short for apocalypse) America where people are fighting amongst one another for resources and life is more unstable than ever.

The first novel follows a young woman named Lauren Olamina who is a ""sharer"" (someone who can feel the pain of others) just before and after she is forced to flee from the only home she has ever known. As she travels north in search of a new life, she makes a conscious effort to reach out to other downtrodden members of society while creating a religion of her own that she has envisioned and titled Earthseed. This religion is unlike many others as it does not focus nor believe in a supernatural entity as a God, instead the core beliefs of Earthseed are that ""God is change"" and that ""all that you touch, you change, all that you change, changes you"".

The religion promotes survival, community, and hope for the future - something that is desperately needed for the struggling people of this dystopian world. However, not everybody takes kindly to Earthseed and there are many struggles that even Lauren cannot forsee or prevent.

The two novels are very dark at times and are definitely not for the faint of heart, but they predict a lot about current struggles facing America in 2024 and beyond, including climate change, social inequality, international war, and an increasingly polarising political landscape. The best example of this is in the second novel when a Christian extremist president comes into power using the slogan ""Make America Great Again"".

These novels were well-received at the time and critically acclaimed. Parable of the Sower won the 1994 New York Times Notable Book of the Year award. Parable of the Talents won the 2000 Nebula Award for Best Novel. Additionally, in 1995, Octavia E. Butler was the first science-fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Genius grant for her work. 

If you'd like any content warnings or more information, feel free to ask below. I'm always excited to talk about this series and Butler in general. Please support this incredible author and I encourage you to read more from Black women in general, their perspectives and creativity are unparalleled and have never been more valuable.",2024-11-10 19:28:48
books,1goe734,Blind Dates with a Book ,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1goe734/blind_dates_with_a_book/,85,"I’ve seen this trend mentioned here and there in articles, videos or reddit posts. I think it is quite well-known, but in case anyone maybe hasn’t heard of it, blind date with a book is the scheme (?) of bookstores selling wrapped books, with little to no information about their contents. This is done in order for people to maybe discover stories and works they wouldn’t have read otherwise, although I suppose it is also a way for bookstores to get rid off unwanted books that don’t sell.

I know this is a well-known little trick, but I mention it because I’ve never actually seen it happening in bookshops over here in my country, neither in large chains nor in smaller indie shops – and I’m honestly a bit frustrated about it, because, regardless of the reason a bookshop decides to do it, I think it is something fun, and an interesting way of discovering books you otherwise wouldn’t have look at.

So, I’d also like to ask about your stories with blind book dates. Have you ever bought a book that way? Did you end up liking it or hating it? Maybe you discovered something amazing you wouldn’t have to otherwise. Just to ease up this frustration of mine and maybe also help share some interesting stories.",2024-11-10 23:30:41

books,1go6ziy,"Autocracy, inc. The dictators who want to run the world, by Anne Applebaum",81,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go6ziy/autocracy_inc_the_dictators_who_want_to_run_the/,36,"[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183932735-autocracy-inc](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183932735-autocracy-inc)

  
Anne Applebaum is an American journalist and historian.

In this book she describes how modern autocracies, despite being fairly different from each other and not sharing many ideological traits, can and do collaborate with each other to remain in power.

Exposure to democracy and to the West has not softened many dictators, and the fall of the Berlin Wall did not mean the fall of all autocracies.

In this book, the author examines the common techniques used by most autocrats all over the globe, and how they collaborate with each other. 

  
One of the most interesting quotes is:



*Western and especially American students of foreign policy often look at the world as a series of separate issues—eastern Europe, the Middle East, the South China Sea—each requiring a different cadre of experts or specialists. But that isn’t how autocracies see the world. Putin backs far-right and extremist movements in Europe and provides thugs and weapons to support African dictatorships. He pursues victory in Ukraine by creating food shortages and raising energy prices around the world. Iran maintains proxies in Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen, and Iraq. Iranian agents have also bombed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, carried out murders in Istanbul and Paris, plotted assassinations in the United States, and funded media throughout the Arab-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds. The Belarusian dictator tried to destabilize his neighbors by luring refugees from the Middle East and helping them cross illegally into Europe. Cuban troops have gone to fight against Ukraine in Russia, while Cuban secret policemen*[*1*](javascript:void(0)) *help protect the Maduro regime in Venezuela. China, with deep economic and political interests across Africa and Latin America, has not thought of itself as an “Asian” power for many years.*



I liked the book, because Applebaum explains matters which affect us all, with a clear style, that presupposes no prerequisite knowledge of modern history or geopolitics.

  
Those who are looking for easy solutions to ""fix the world"" and topple dictators will be disappointed - the author does not offer easy solutions to complex problems; yes, in her epilogue ""democrats united"" she mentions, amongst other things, what the West can do to make it harder for kleptocrats to launder money, buy prized real estate, etc, but she's mature and realistic enough to appreciate that there is no quick and easy recipe  guaranteed to work against dictators.

  
Possibly the only part I didn't like is that the author didn't really analyse what to do, what is best for the population in question but also, selfishly, for the West, when a country run by a dictator is not ready for an alternative. Toppling Saddam Hussein in Iraq was an example. Toppling Gaddafi in Libya another one - the country plunged into chaos, the Islamic state ended up a stone's throw away from Italy and therefore from the southern border of the European Union, etc.",2024-11-10 18:17:15
books,1gnxwky,Did you ever read a book that make you laugh out loud? What book and what passage?,277,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnxwky/did_you_ever_read_a_book_that_make_you_laugh_out/,620,"I am not the kind of person who laughs out loud at things. I sometimes smile to myself and occasionally chuckle. And rarely at what I consider juvenile or meanspirited or grossout humor.

But there are exceptions, lol.

From time to time, I have come across something that was really funny, and maybe also as a result of being tired and unable to control myself, I have laughed out loud.

Most recently I was reading Moby Dick, and then came across this passage, which is about Ishmael and fellow sailors squeezing the oil from a recently killed sperm whale:

>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,- Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

Ishmael's excitement and the word play was just a little too much and I saw a couple of people look at me, probably wondering why I burst out laughing in this quiet coffee place.

Has that happened to you?

P.S. Moby Dick is a tough book to read (I don't even know how to classify it), and there are many terms you have to look up, but it's also quite hilarious in parts and generally entertaining.",2024-11-10 10:37:08

I signed up for Aardvark to have a wider pick of fantasy and sci-fi to supplement or eventually replace BOTM and the book I picked happened to be one that was signed (though I did not pick it because of that fact).


I went to turn in several books at my Half Price Books (sadly our only individually owned used store closed years ago) and found a new copy of We Solve Murders that was ALSO signed, so I put the cash I got for the books toward it (I'd passed it up at Barnes and Noble 3 times already).

There were perceptive and convincing insights on females friendships, compelling depictions of gender and class disparities in Naples, and I especially liked the way Ferrante illustrated the loneliness of being academically minded in a working class environment.

books,1gnybhb,"""Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World."" An easy-to-read, non-technical book on how to analyse critically the multiple claims we are exposed to daily. I absolutely loved it.",130,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnybhb/calling_bullshit_the_art_of_skepticism_in_a/,17,"# What the book is about

The blurb on the book website [https://callingbullshit.org/](https://callingbullshit.org/) is very well written, and will give you a quick idea of whether you're likely to be interested in this book or not.

I am quoting in italic because sometimes reddit removes quoted text:

  
*Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence.*

*Calling bullshit is a performative utterance, a speech act in which one publicly repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bullshit alone. You can call bullshit on bullshit, but you can also call bullshit on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice.*

*\[...\]*

*Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.*

  
The authors are two academics, two scientists who teach in US universities:

[https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/carl-bergstrom](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/carl-bergstrom) and [https://jevinwest.org/cv.html](https://jevinwest.org/cv.html)

To be clear, I have no affiliation whatsoever with the authors nor the publisher.

  
The book reads as if it were a college course. In fact, I think the authors do, or did in the recent past, give a similar course, although with a milder title like ""reasoning with data"".

  
I found it very well-written and easy to read; it didn't require knowledge of mathematics or statistics.

Think of it like a course in critical thinking, which, with many worked examples, will teach you how to be sceptical and what questions you should be asking before buying whatever it is that the bullshitter of the day is trying to sell. It explores topics like:

* Are we comparing apples to apples? Are there other factors at play which we are ignoring?
* Causality and spurious correlations. many excellent examples of this are at: [https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) 
* Selection bias.
* How to lie with charts, e.g. cropping the axes or even inverting them. There is an example of a chart on gun deaths where the vertical axis is inverted, so a line that goes down actually mean that deaths were increasing
* Comparing quantities with different denominators:  *If I tell you that one-quarter of car accidents involve drunk drivers, you don’t conclude that drunk driving is safer than driving sober. You know that drunk driving is relatively rare, and that if one-quarter of accidents involve drunk drivers, there must be a huge increase in risk.*
* How to interpret percentages. E.g. if the effectiveness of something went from 99.5% to 99% it doesn't seem like a huge deal. But if you think of it in terms of failure rate, the probability of it not working, that's just doubled, from 0.5% to 1.0%. There are many such examples
* The problems with big data and machine learning 



Importantly, while a lot of the bullshit we are exposed to is the product of bad faith, not all of it is, which in a way makes it more insidious to spot, as it can come from actors acting in good faith, and whom you might have no reason to mistrust.



# Why I loved it

I absolutely loved this book. I think it should be compulsory reading for any teenager, as the topics it covers and the skills it teaches are absolutely crucial in today's world. It strikes a perfect balance between providing enough detail to be relevant, but not enough that it requires technical mathematical knowledge which would out off many readers.

I also appreciated that the authors are adamant that they want to *avoid creating a legion of “well, actually” guys. What’s a well-actually guy? It’s the guy who interrupts a conversation to demonstrate his own cleverness by pointing out some irrelevant factoid that renders the speaker incorrect on a technicality.*

The focus of the book is absolutely not that - it is to push readers to have a more scientific, evidence-driven approach, and to refute the claims which cannot be substantiated.



In a way, these data analyses skills are more crucial than certain advanced mathematical  topics, because not everyone will use calculus in their daily lives, while absolutely everyone will be exposed to claims, data, statistics and analysis, on which important policies will be driven, which will affect their lives, on which they should decide how to vote, etc. In other words, not everyone will use calculus but absolutely everyone will need to interpret data. Of course the most advanced statistical concepts require a solid grounding in mathematics, but this book shows that the general public can be exposed to the very basics without needing a foundation of advanced maths.



# Other books

This book reminded me of the classic ""How to lie with statistics"", but this one is of course much more modern; the examples and the writing style are more likely to be captivating to a modern audience [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How\_to\_Lie\_with\_Statistics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How_to_Lie_with_Statistics)

Two other books that come to mind are: The art of statistics, by British statistician David Spiegelhalter, and Probably the best book on statistics ever written, which is interesting despite its cringey title. However , both books get into more technical detail, and are therefore less likely to appeal to the same broad audience as this one.

I read The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnuuar/where_can_you_go_when_you_already_experienced/,46,"I think it would be great if we could start out with lesser books and then read the best books only later in life. Because what if you read a book that's so good and makes like 95% of things out there look so unsatisfactory?

I kind of feel that way with The Little Prince. On the surface, it's not a significant book at all. I mean this is technically a children's book.

But if you look deeper, it's really about adult themes, like loneliness and love. The book is so unique, it's hard to explain it. It's like fantasy, adventure, comedy, poetry, philosophy, and with a dash of whimsy. Okay more than a dash.

This is a particularly good read for adults who have forgotten how it felt to be a child. The innocence, the curiosity and wonder, that creative energy, that sense of adventure. It reawakens all that.

It's a novella so if you haven't read it, it won't take long. It's written in simple language, perhaps deceptively simple.

I was gonna give you a bit of the plot but the magic lies not so much in the plot or character or anything like that, it's almost an alternate reality, a kind of a dream, that opens your eyes to seeing the reality  If you need a reminder about how to look at life with new eyes.

But like everything else, you need to read it at the right time and in the right mindset. Be patient. Don't have any expectations. Let the little prince guide you.

* ***Wind and Truth*** by Brandon Sanderson

This is the fifth book in the Stormlight Archives series. I fell in love with this series when I first read it in March and it really brought me back into reading after a couple years of struggling to read as much as I used to pre-2020. I feel like I read this series at the perfect time to get back.

* ***Onyx Storm*** by Rebecca Yarros

I've read each book in the series as its come out. I've always loved dragon rider books and romantasies so getting them combined into one has been an incredible experience. I've only ever listened to the audiobooks and that's how I'll be enjoying *Onyx Storm* as well!

* ***A Language of Dragon****s* by S.F. Williamson

I don't think I've heard too many people talk about this book but it's essentially an alternate history if dragons roamed the Earth. I've heard it's perfect for fans of *Fourth Wing* and *Babel*. Even though I haven't read the latter yet, it's on my longlist of a TBR. The marketing tag line immediately drew me in:

>Every act of translation requires sacrifice. Welcome to Bletchley Park . . . with dragons.

* ***Sunrise on the Reaping*** by Suzanne Collins

I've been a *Hunger Games* fan since before the first movie came out. I never thought that Suzanne Collins would write about Haymitch's games and I'm very interested to see what story she has chosen to tell. I have so many theories and ideas bouncing around in my head and I'm eagerly awaiting the release. Also I'm probably going to be booking a couple of days off of work to read this uninterrupted.

One particular metaphor stopped me cold: the moth and the flame.

Greene observes how influential figures throughout history used mystery and strategy in relationships. He doesn't prescribe these as tactics, but rather shows how they've played out across centuries. It's anthropology of seduction, if you will.

Then comes Rumi's moth - flying straight into the flame, embracing its own destruction. Not calculating, not observing, just pure devotion. While Greene documents how people protect and position themselves, Rumi suggests the opposite - complete surrender as the highest form of connection.

What fascinates me is how both authors study the same human experience from completely different angles. Greene looks at the patterns of how people behave, while Rumi examines why at the deepest level.

Has anyone else found themselves caught between these perspectives? How do you reconcile Greene's keen observations of human nature with Rumi's call for transcending it entirely?",2024-11-10 21:09:54

What are some characters that made you love them because they reminded you of someone close to you, or someone you admired or loved?  
  
I'll share mine:  There is a book called ""Little, Big"" by author John Crowley.  One of the characters is a young man named Auberon, who has a complicated relationship with his father.  Auberon is a quiet child who keeps a lot to himself.  This causes a sort of rift between him and his father (who I see a lot of myself in).  So many of Auberon's mannerisms, experiences, actions, etc. are very similar to my youngest son's.  We all ache when our children have their hearts broken.  We all worry when they set off into the big scary world.  Of all the characters in literature, I think I love Auberon the most because he reminds me so much of my son (even my mental picture of Auberon has my son's face, and my son's voice is the one I hear in my head when I read Auberon's dialogue).",2024-11-09 21:28:14

Now comes a thoughtful article talking about the genesis of the trend, and I'm intrigued. Have you read anything in this genre?

For me, the closest I've come is a book about [workshops on dying](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30337608-ganbare-warsztaty-umierania) that were held in Japan following the horrific earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, so not ""healing fiction"" -- not aimed at healing the reader, but about the practice of healing itself. I found Ganbare! to be thought provoking, with ways of thinking about holding grief that I hadn't considered previously.

I think my reluctance around Before the Coffee Gets Cold and others in the genre comes from a feeling that grief and regret are more complex and deeper than can be healed by a short visit to the past. Also, I don't seem to have any past stuff that's unhealed -- not that all my family relationships are perfect, but that I'm comfortable and satisfied with where they landed. 

When I think of healing fiction written in English, I think of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, by Rachel Joyce. The only magic here is the idea that you can, on a whim, take off on a walk across the country. But here, the ""Pilgrimage"" takes long enough that I felt like old Harold did have sufficient space to sort a lot out in his head. A great deal longer than the length of time it takes for coffee to grow cold.

What happened was that I was having a chat with a fellow reader who said he likes Of Mice and Men, in particular Lennie Small, for whom he feels only one thing: Sorrow. He pities the guy. That's it. Kind of like how he feels about animals because they are innocent. 

I appreciate that perspective and at times I do feel the same way, being drawn to characters who don't trigger too many feelings in me. 

Sometimes those feelings can be intense though. Like Palpatine in Star Wars. You just feel negative feelings toward the guy. And hate him with a passion.

But I feel that more realistic characters usually trigger a combination of different feelings. That is how a friend described her feelings toward Heathcliff. She said she feels compassion toward him, yet hates him. I said for me it's very difficult to feel any affection for him. When he was young, yes, but later, no. 

Things were different with Holden Caulfield. She just hated the brat, whereas I felt a lot of different feelings toward him: anger, compassion, sorrow, confusion, etc. Not initially but when I reread the book as I got older and felt I understood him a little better.

books,1gmtkmw,Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gmtkmw/hope_in_the_dark_by_rebecca_solnit/,21,"For those feeling the sadness, despair, anguish, fear and anger of this week, I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 2016 and it has been my guiding light since, especially in the face of political upheaval (on all sides of the spectrum) and the lure of pessimism and apathy. Below is one of my favorite passages from the book:

“To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk. 

I say all this because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say it because hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth’s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal. Hope just means another world is possible, not promised, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

Wow…just, wow…what a remarkable book! The Passenger is not like other McCarthy books. It’s more of a mystery, and I rather enjoyed seeing McCarthy’s style of writing be used to make a mystery come to life. 

I have a strange habit of not researching McCarthy’s books enough before reading them. I stumbled into Blood Meridian and was unprepared for the violence in that story. Meanwhile, I stumbled into The Passenger and was unprepared for the depth of sadness the characters experienced and the depth of sadness those characters would lead me to experience. I’m just a guy trying to enjoy a book during his lunch break. Instead, I find myself deep in mourning for Bobby and Alicia. I feel an incredible sense of loss after reading this book.

books,1gmcl9u,Rebecca by du Maurier and anxiety,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gmcl9u/rebecca_by_du_maurier_and_anxiety/,55,"I just finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and really enjoyed scanning through some reddit posts discussing it!

I was shocked that this was labeled as a romance novel on the cover of the copy I read. There was truly nothing romantic about it, only sad and horrifying.

The narrator reminded me of a younger version of myself in a lot of ways. I have OCD and one of my compulsions is rehearsing what I would do/say for any possible scenario in addition to people pleasing and just anxiety in general. I am NOT saying the narrator was written with OCD, but it’s very obvious she is riddled with anxiety. The way we see her carry out what people could say and what she would say reminds me a lot of my own compulsions. Even down to the way Maxim describes the narrator mouthing silent words and dissociating when she does it. 

The narrator also doesn’t seem to have any family or caretaker ties. When she is excited to send a letter, she can’t think of anyone to write to, except her old employer. While she mentions telling Maxim about her childhood, the audience is never clued in about anything to do with her family. I come from a very unstable childhood with abuse. I would get so anxious when people around me were sad or upset, constantly hyper aware of facial expressions, tone, and needs. I always felt like I had to fix everything for everyone in order to be safe. Seeing the narrator’s inner dialogue reminds me a lot of what I was like.

Maxim never shows any kindness or thought towards the narrator. She seems to view this as a response to his mourning, rather than his selfish nature. I think her anxiety, age, and lack of family fulfilled Max’s desire for total control in a marriage. She purposefully was written to have no autonomy- just doing whatever she’s told. Really, she just had to fulfill a figurehead of a wife for the look of Manderley. He reminds me so much of past relationships I’ve had, even down to his “I’m no good for you” angsty outbursts.

With people pleasing anxiety, all the red flags of those around you go out the window. She’s so scared of getting in trouble and getting rejected. The narrator also can’t see the danger because of her inexperience. As a young girl, the idea of an older man dating you makes you feel mature. Then as you age, you realize that the ‘older man’ that is into a teenager is a creepy loser.

The ending makes me so sad. Maxim is still in control of her life. 

Long story short - it’s a cautionary tale. Also, thank god I got therapy so I can view the narrator in correlation to my past and not to who I am today.

Edit: also forgot to add: Maxim seems to feel no remorse over ending someone’s life! It’s been a year and he doesn’t share any reflection on his actions or behavior, nor the impact Rebecca’s death had on those around her. Only regret over the possibility of getting caught.",2024-11-08 06:48:36
books,1gm71rw,When was the last time you delayed finishing a book because you were enjoying it so much you didn't want it to end?,314,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gm71rw/when_was_the_last_time_you_delayed_finishing_a/,237,"I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I'm really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don't want it to end. With movies, I guess I've never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That's not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. 

This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.

For example, with Les Misérables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables 2 and Les Miserables 3, as often is with Hollywood movies that make a lot of money. I wanted to see what Jean Valjean is doing, how is Cosette managing, what new adventures await them.

So, after really having a great time with a book, I search like crazy for other highly rated books by the author, but often they do not match the intensity and power of the original, unless you happen to have started with a lesser known work by the author, which I rarely do. I go for their best books first. Only if I enjoy it, then I go back and try to find everything else they have written.

Anybody know what I'm talking about?",2024-11-08 01:35:02

I don’t feel curious about what will happen next and I kind of really don’t care? The initial chapter was supposed to draw me into the story I guess? It just didn’t.

I don't get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.

An example of this would be Ian McEwan's *Saturday*. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.

This isn't a complaint or anything. It's just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading.

Here I again revisit Clarke's fantastic future with two space expeditions that have become completely entangled with human necessity and the laws of physics. And here the survivor of his two previous encounters with the monoliths Heywood Floyd must yet again confront David Bowman, or what was David Bowman, a newly independent Hal and the strange powers of an alien race that has now decided that humanity must play a part in the galaxy's evolution, whether it wants to or not.

Book number two, which now takes place a few decades later from the events of the second book, is pretty decent (seem to be using that one quite a bit!). It isn't as great as the previous two but I dug it anyhow. The feel here is a bit different, but not in a very big way to speak of. There is an adventure element in it that gives it a little more variety, which is pretty nice.

While there is a thread to the whole story but as it (as I'm also finding out) it jumps to a few years in the second and then in the third I've just finished, a few decades. Some people will find this annoying as they don't get any explanations as the series goes on, especially with the last two books in it. But I kind of find this as a minor annoyance, as I can still follow the thread of the story despite the jumps in the timeline.

For Clarke himself he never thought of ""2061"", or ""2010"", as linear sequels. He would describe them, in the author's note at the beginning of ""2061"", as variations on a theme with the same characters and situations and never happening in the same universe. That makes sense, but the thread's still there, even if it's not linear. And  now onto book three!",2024-11-08 03:18:20

The People tended to be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness. And so the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.

As soon as you saw people as things to be measured, they didn't measure up. What would run through the streets soon enough wouldn't be a revolution or a riot. It'd be people who were frightened and panicking. It was what happened when the machinery of city life faltered, the wheels stopped turning and all the little rules broke down.

The blurb I had seen for ""The Last Man"" by Mary Shelley is: ""The Last Man"" is an apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction novel by Mary Shelley, first published in 1826.

Based on the publication date, I knew it wouldn't be Stephen King or whatever, but I did expect some juicy stuff to happen. 

As I got through Volume One of this book, I started to think ""wait, this sounds familiar,"" and I realized that I must have started it once before, but I know I didn't finish it. 

Right now, I just finished volume one, about a week of heavy reading, and there's been no apocalypse, no supernatural or sci-fi elements... (well, one character did travel by hot-air balloon, so maybe that counts...)

Honestly, the writing is really really good. The story is pretty engaging, with the inner lives of the characters described in great detail, with beautiful language. Mary Shelley is an amazing writer, no doubt. 

I read ""Frankenstein,"" a while back, and I liked that a lot. I like how in the book the ""monster,"" talks in eloquent paragraphs, while in the movies he just goes ""uuuuugghhhhhh."" 

But I digress. I'm a pretty patient reader, and I'm not unfamiliar with slow-moving classics. I've read Moby Dick. Dox Quixote. Les Miserables. Crime and Punishment... All those kept me hooked.

I don't know why I'm making this post, exactly. I guess I want to ask y'all if I should push through with The Last Man, or let it go. I feel kind of embarrassed to DNF the same book twice... 

For me, classics can be hit or miss. Some of them feel so fresh, so relevant, so engaging. Others, for whatever reason, I can't get into.

Have y'all read ""The Last Man""? What do you think of it? Am I crazy in thinking that the build-up to whatever is going to happen is hella slow? But maybe now I am intrigued... I don't know...

(Mild spoilers that is implied in book blurb below)

For context, I’m East Asian who grew up in both the US and Asia, and have spent time learning about the Sino-Japanese War. To this day, the effect of the violence of comfort women is still felt, and being discussed. I understand that this book is “inspired” or based on historical events, but borrowing in details of these war atrocities (Rape of Nanking, Unit 731 experiments, comfort women) in a fantasy novel feels almost exploitive, to have this pain used for entertainment. Especially for readers that don’t have as much context of the historical events and reading just as a secondary world fantasy without understanding this happened to actual people in real life. I am absolutely not comparing tragedies, but TJ Klune had been in the center of controversy (and rightfully so) for his book, The House in the Cerulean Sea for using genocide as inspiration (please read more on this, if you haven’t heard about this). And I feel like Poppy War has done the same thing without much discussion on it.

This is all to say, I’m curious where the line between using historical tragedies as inspiration and being exploitive is?

Edit to add: I‘ve only read the first book; and the main thing that really bothered me was how “historically accurate“ some of the events in Poppy War are even though it is a fantasy. Is it justified to use a scene by scene massacre for a novel?",2024-11-07 08:01:42

From the beginning, I was fascinated by Alicia’s character—her silence after her husband’s murder and the psychological unraveling around why she wouldn’t speak a word. Theo, the psychologist who becomes obsessed with her case, seemed like the one who would finally reveal the truth, but every new piece of information just added to the suspense. The twists and turns completely blindsided me, and by the end, I just had to sit there and take it all in. The way it left me feeling a little incomplete but deeply engaged really stuck with me. The revelation about Theo’s connection to Alicia’s story absolutely blindsided me, and it made me question everything I’d read up until that point. I had to re read the last few chapters again to make sense of what was happening. It left me wanting more details and closure.

books,1gkdswv,Why Reading Matters,2321,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gkdswv/why_reading_matters/,213,"Something about this US election is making me want to encourage everyone to read more literature. I'm going to write down some things I've been thinking for years. I'm not sure if this will be of any use to anybody, but I figure it can't hurt to share. 

The point of reading is not just to learn stuff or be entertained. You will forget most of what you learn and most of what entertains you. Knowledge and entertainment are flimsy, fleeting things. They come. They go. And when they go, you will be left sitting in a chair, searching for the next distraction from the pain you're in. 

Reading is difficult because it requires you to make so many decisions. The whole time you read, you have to continuously decide to not stop reading. Then you have to decide what each word means. Then you have to decide how the meaning of that word relates to the rest of the words around it. Then you have to decide the purpose of each paragraph or stanza, and you have to figure out how it relates to all the other paragraphs or stanzas. Sometimes, when you can't figure out what something means, you have to accept your confusion and press on.

It's easier to just not read. It's easier to let a video wash over you. Here is why. Visual entertainment requires very little of you. If you stop thinking, the video keeps happening. You can passively receive it. If you stop reading, the story stops, too. With reading, you're completely in charge of the experience. Your brain is churning. You're working. It's tough. There is nothing passive about it. 

But the more you do it, the more your brain habituates that meaning-making mode. You start to interpret life actively. You naturally ask questions, piece things together, decide what makes sense, decide what doesn't. If you read enough, then your brain becomes inherently critical, which is the opposite of passive.

So even if you forget most of what you read, the practice of reading will make you harder to manipulate, since you will be used to doing the hard work of interpreting. The less you read, the easier you are to manipulate, since your brain gets accustomed to being a passive receptacle of images and information. You simply don't have to work as hard to consume a video than you do when you consume written language, and the hard work of reading is exactly the thing that will keep your mind potent, independent, critical, and growing.

But a more critical mind is not the main reason I'm encouraging you to keep reading during this era of endless entertainment. I'm encouraging you to keep reading because you are sometimes going to feel brutally, severely alone. And when writers use language to try to capture what it feels like to be alive, you can catch a glimpse of yourself in their language, and you can realize, in a really powerful way, that others have felt just as alone as you are feeling, and you can connect with those writers across time and space, and you can be together with them in your aloneness.

There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body. And when people do this regularly, they develop a deep empathy. Empathetic people do not want to fall in line with violent leaders. They do not want to be manipulated into hurting people.

In Kafka on the Shore, >!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!<. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called ""Escape from Tomorrow"" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where >!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android.

One is the various isms (racism, sexism, and the like). I think I have become desensitized to them from having read too many older books that were written at a time when these bigoted attitudes were the norm and many people were not aware of the damage that these stereotypical views caused. 

So now if I'm reading a contemporary crime novel and the detective is a bit of a macho guy and sexist, I continue reading, though feeling a little annoyed. But if I find that the detective is actually what the author believes and that the author is kind of hiding behind the character but has an agenda, I will stop.

I was recently reading Eruption, a novel that Michael Crichton started writing but was left unfinished at the time of his death. Years later, Crichton’s widow enlisted James Patterson to complete the book. 

That got me thinking of other instances where an author died and left a story unfinished (Charles Dickens, Robert E. Howard, V.C. Andrews, Robert B. Parker, just to name a few) and somebody came in and finished their story, trying to capture the same “feel” of the original author. 

The results (at least to me) mostly fall short, the work in question coming off as a disjointed mess. 

Or when an author will write a popular book series and then die and then the estate will hire another author to write new books in the series. I understand the desire to want to tell new stories in that narrative world and to not let the characters die, but much of the time the results come off like cheap fanfiction.

books,1glghqb,My gripe about feminist critiques of Twilight/Stephanie Meyer. ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1glghqb/my_gripe_about_feminist_critiques_of/,61,"As the original reader base of the Twilight series is likely in their 30s now, there is surprisingly no shortage of content being made about the books on social media and I am honestly sick of how admonishing and critical is. 

The critiques are largely about how it's so appalingly sexist and absurd, yet relish in the content to an obsessive degree. There are whole accounts just about deconstructing her work.

- ""She's Mormon, the books are trash because it's all Mormon coded"" 
- ""She hates women so much""
- ""These ideas are in her books, so they must be in her brain"" 


I genuinely think the people psycologizing Stephanie Meyer, yet devouring her work are more woman hating. 
They say ""The Host doesn't have these issues, I wonder what changed"" (direct quote). 
The Host is a great example, the writing is NOT actually better or different than Twilight. 

She was writing based on her lived experience and from her worldview, she always was. Not every woman is a sexually liberated feminist as a teen girl. Why are they asking that of her - retroactively at that?
The books are practically smut, it's erotica for teenage girls. 
No one is talking about how it must be so depraved, psychopathic, and misogynistic it must be in Cormac McCarthy's mind. No one's saying he must be a serial killer. No one cares because he's a man. 

Everyone loves to pick apart female authors, when men write detestable things beautifully, it's so disgusting to me.  

They do it with Diana Gabaldon too. 
""She is so obsessed with nipples and breast feeding, I bet that she's projecting the kink she wants from her husband into her work. It makes me sooo uncomfortable to read that, it's in every book, I can't escape it."" On the same coin, read every Outlander book 3 times and watched the series 5 times. 

What if, we just let women authors be the same way we let male authors be? 
Why are all the critiques about modern literature only ever about sexual themes, never about true  violence? 
Why is it so gross that two characters desire each other sexually when it's not labeled in a specific way, but if two characters cut 100 men into tiny pieces it's just cool? 

People always complain about sexual assault and adult themes in books, yet buy all the books that contain edgy content and lap them up. 
Read a different genre? 

The only male sex related literary critiques I've ever heard are about IT and Lolita. And many women will come to the rescue of Nabakov immediately, I never see men defend him. 
The most hear about King is that his choices in it were strange and unsettling and he regrets it. 
Then it's back to ripping Meyer to literal shreds. 
And reading books about semi consensual cannibalism, but that's fine because written by a man. Lol. 

If you find Twilight distasteful, move on from it. 
Stop stewing in it. You grew out of it, like everyone else, right? Or do you still secretly love it and the only way to have proximity to it is to make character assassinations on its author in an echochamber and get back pats from all the other mature ladies who moved on to beastality and own multiple centaur smut books on kindle...
In between rankings about how absurd Edward Cullen's genitalia is and laughing about the sound it makes when imaginary vampires kiss. 

You're  hypocrites. Stop beating a dead horse. 
They aren't great books, leave that poor woman alone and stop consuming what you supposedly  hate so much. 
Stephanie Meyer is a real person with a real life and a family. Imagine how crushing it is as a creative mind to have your fans drag you through the mud until the end of time. The same people who begged you for more.. 

Just so weird. 

I can understand critiquing the work, not when guilded in fanatacism but okay, but the relentless mean girl judging of the author and digging into their personal lives, trying to diagnose them and shame them for the work they produced in some long past chapter of their lives, is so inappropriate. These are living women. 
If you don't do it to the graphic male authors, don't do it to the female authors. 

Also I believe we should be able to thoughtfully explore graphic concepts in writing. Readers calling for censorship in the genres they love to read is crazy to me. We are so desensitized to violence we think it's more disgusting for a *character* to have non politically correct, non violent thoughts than it is for a *character* to slaughter people. 

What is that about? 
I would think that if you can't swallow unsavory scenes you would be particularly outraged by literal torture. Instead it's the actual villains that attract women. It reminds me of the people who form intimate relationships with serial killers behind bars, even marry them. 

Just so twisted, that instead of taking the work at face value, we unequally judge things. Evil is okay, but traditional values are not. 
How about it's all okay, because it's fiction, and you get to chose what media you consume or not. ",2024-11-07 02:46:57
books,1gjcf17,What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever read?,1185,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gjcf17/whats_the_most_disturbing_book_youve_ever_read/,2554,"Actually, let me rephrase that… What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever managed to get through? Because I don’t mean disturbing like, “damn… This is kind of messed up…’’ I mean disturbing like, “this is so fucked up that I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish it.’’ The word disturbing can take on several different meanings. So you can interpret it however you’d like. But, to me, disturbing is something that either disgusts you, triggers you, makes you so angry that you want to cry, or rips your heart out in a way that makes you wanna launch the book across the room. But it’s almost as if there is some type of gravitational pull keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  

I’m 31 years old and have been reading since I was a child. I have come across very few books that have actually managed to disturb me. The first book I ever read that I found to be slightly disturbing was the lovely bones by Alice Sebold. I read it when I was only 16 years old, so, back then, it was pretty messed up. It became one of my favorite books of all time though, hands-down,. Now that I am an adult, I think two of the most disturbing books I have ever read are Tampa by Alyssa nutting and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell.  

I’m only halfway through Tampa right now and honestly, I’m not sure if I’m gonna be able to finish it. The protagonist is, without a doubt, the most sociopathic MC I have ever come across.  

My Dark Vanessa, however, is one of the most disturbing, yet beautifully heart wrenching portrayals of trauma that I have ever read in my life. I would almost bet money that Kate Elizabeth Russell has been through something similar herself. Otherwise, I don’t see any way she would be able to capture it so brilliantly. In my opinion, it truly is a literary masterpiece.  

So, what about y’all? What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever managed to get through? What made it so disturbing? What ultimately made you decide to keep reading? How did you feel about the book as a whole once it was through? Would you be interested in ever rereading it? Feel free to add any other comments you deem necessary.

I found it so incredibly amazing, even though it really wasn't that great of a book. Plus the foreword completely spoiled it.

But holy shit, I really like that book. I really do. There's so many aspects that make it as good as it is.

The biggest one is that the kids are confined, but they're not necessarily forced to be there. They weren't kidnapped - they were tricked and lied to. As Chris and Cathy showed, they could've left at any time. Or at least a lot earlier than they did. (I'm sure they could've managed with the twins.)

That's the part that really gets me. I'm not blaming the children for their suffering, but I think it's wild that they REALLY could've left at any time after figuring out a way down. 

It was more of a psychological jail imo. Staying because they're under a delusion that they'll share their mother's inheritance 

Another part is that I think the section of my job is about as big as the attic would've been, and I think about how nuts it would be to stay there for three years. Since I have a personal reference, it makes the story more bewildering.

And the idea of there being children you don't know about in a house is so unsettling too 😭😭😭😭

Corrine's character development was CRAZY. Because I'm sure she truly loved her late husband and family (because why would she initially give up her inheritance?), but as we can see from the first few chapters, she was planning on keeping the kids in the attic indefinitely.

Also, Bart.

But how could she do that??? I thought she genuinely loved those kids, and she never knew Christopher was going to die. So, if he didn't die, they'd just keep living the way they did?

After I finished the book, I kept having questions like that. Why did x happen/not happen? Why didn't something happen instead?

But it doesnt seem like one of those stories when there's a big plot hole; it seems like there could always be a reasonable explanation.

More Questions:

• What did you think of Chris?

Personally, I thought he was annoying as hell, but I still like him. He was the main reason the kids didn't escape earlier. No good mother would be comfortable locking their kids in a room for even a few hours. So, after the first few days/weeks passed...He really should've caught on.

• Why didn't Corrine put the kids in boarding school or foster care?

• Why couldn't the kids find some agency/charity/organization to help them after they got out? I'm not sure why they decided to steal money instead.",2024-11-05 06:12:40

Man.  What a book.  I haven't been this impressed with the scholarship level of a book since I read David Hackett Fischer's book Paul Revere's Ride, published in 1994.  The book - Pocahontas and the English Boys - basically took my brain, as far as anything was in it regarding early Virginia, and turned it inside out and gave it a good wash and a vigorous scrub.

I was trying to learn about slavery in early Virginia.  Why on earth did George Yeardley purchase those ""20. and Odd Negroes"" in 1619?  What did he think he was doing?  I emailed a well respected historian and haven't heard back.  Maybe it went straight to his spam folder, who knows.  And I did not learn much from this book about slavery in early Virginia.  As far as I could tell, slavery wasn't a part of any of these people's conceptions of the world between 1607 and 1617, which is basically when the book ends.

Although other sources claim that after John Smith left what was to become New England, in 1614, the ship commander he left behind promptly seized two dozen Indians and sold them as slaves in Spain.  Spain, of course, had been into the slave trade for much longer than England, and had made a LOT of money off it.

But anyway.  Did you know that in the 17th century, it was common for British sub-teenagers to be apprenticed out?  Now you know.  Apparently parents feared that their too strong attachments, to their kids, would prevent them from exercising the kind of discipline the kids really needed.  And it happened again and again that the Virginia colonists took youngsters of 11, 12, 13 years old and sent them off to live with the Indians.  Not to apprentice them out but so the Indians would raise them knowing the Indian languages, so that they would then be able to come back and help the colonists deal with the Indians.

And so the book basically follows the careers of some of these teenagers - and Pocahontas too, she was 10 years old when she was sent to live with the colonists for a little while.  The marriage with John Smith was all hocus, more of a kind of ""adoption"" of Smith into the Powhatan tribe.  Although her marriage with John Rolfe, later, was apparently real.

And tobacco!  I knew, as who did not, that tobacco was important in Virginia.  But no one ever told me before that tobacco was the whole reason the colony thrived, and the only thriving any of the colonies did for quite some time.  It was the discovery that tobacco could be produced much more cheaply in Virginia - not using slave labor yet, they hadn't started yet - and sold to the masses in Europe, that made the colonies a paying proposition for their backers in England.  Virginia tobacco, in the early 1600s (1619 to 1622) created a sensation in Europe.  People for whom tobacco had always been an unimaginable luxury suddenly could afford it, and found that they wanted to.  And that was what really got the colonies going.

And apparently - according to the book - it was the Indians that showed the British how to grow and cure tobacco!  It's not so easy.  You don't just throw a couple of seeds in the earth and hold your breath while they grow.  The Indians apparently took some care and some trouble to educate the British on just how it was done.

Unfortunately, the new tobacco craze inspired more and more and more to come to the colony.  They were planting tobacco in the streets of Jamestown.  And the massive influx of colonists, of course, demanded more and more land, and land wasn't quite as easy to come by as our high school history books implied.  There were Indians already on the land, and they had borders, and border conflicts, and power struggles just as the Europeans had.

Well, there's more - lots more - but it's all interesting.  Highly recommended.",2024-11-04 22:14:24

books,1gj8jfz,The Midnight Library was not the best...but it wasn't the worst either,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gj8jfz/the_midnight_library_was_not_the_bestbut_it_wasnt/,43,"When I was younger (say 12-13 years old) I had read ""A Boy called Christmas"" by Matt Haig. Since then it has become one of my most beloved books and I have read it many times. One year ago I noticed that another book by the same author was gaining more popularity and that was none other than The Midnight Library. I was intrigued by the plot and the mixed reviews and I decided to keep an eye on it for the future. Last Christmas my sister gifted it to me but due to high school exams, I wasn't able to read it - until now.

I'll start by saying that although the book did not meet all of my expectations, I was not disappointed. Truth be said, I expected to like it more than I did but it didn't leave a bad taste on me once I was done reading it. Is it overhyped. Most likely yes? Did I enjoy it? Also yes. I think that it's good that I read it now, because had I read it sooner, when my excitement over it was higher, I would be more disappointed.

From the very first pages, I was hooked by the plot. We get to see Nora's life, how miserable she feels and how she has given up on life. Once Nora enters the midnight library after she attempts to kill herself, we witness her journey to find the perfect life for her. She is not alone. In the library she finds Mrs Elm, the old librarian from her old school. With her help she tries to navigate through the millions possible lives she could live in. But what is the best way to live?

I found the concept of the book very imaginative. I haven't read any books like this before and the system was very unique too. Just imagine how interesting it would be if we had the opportunity to travel to all of the different lives we might have lived! How different our path would be if we did even the smallest change in our life. Matt Haig did a good job crafting this magic system and for the most part, I enjoyed following Nora in her different paths.

The book did a good job exploring Nora's regrets and sadness. At the beginning it's clear that Nora is suffocated by her guilt and desperation. She regrets the things she did and the things she didn't do. She feels like she has wasted her life and isolated by almost everyone, she doesn't find a reason to live anymore. Her past haunts her continuously and in the library, she finds the chance to undo her mistakes and live her life differently. However, she quickly realises that what sounded so wonderful in her head was not what she made it out to be. Most of her biggest regrets were because she didn't get to fullfil other people's wishes. Her father's dream to see her become a great competitive swimmer. Her ex-fiance's dream to open a pub in the country. Her brother's dream to become a famous musician. And the list goes on.

Throughout her life, Nora was focused on trying to please the people around her. The dreams she didn't get to fullfil were never her own. Of course she found enjoyment in some things, like studying philosophy, playing music or swimming. But most of her goals were guided by others' desires. She never got to have her own ambitions. Instead of following her own path, she tries to live up to the expectations of others - and ultimately fail. But that changes as she travels in her other lives. She accepts that she can't undo her past. She accepts her own regrets. And she finally finds enjoyment in living. She doesn't seek death and she wants to live instead. But there is one question: what could her best possible live be?

For the most part, I enjoyed reading about the different lives of Nora. It was interesting to see how different the outcome would be had she made different decisions. Although I didn't fully connect with Nora, I felt sympathy for her, especially at the beginning. I could understand her frustation and worries and I really wanted her to find the best life. I also enjoyed seeing her growth and how she came to appreciate herself and value.

The writing was good. It was simple and at times, it was quite lyrical. Some parts made me laugh, some made me angry and some others made me sad. There were many quotes that resonated with me and made me pause and rethink about my choices and life. In some parts, the book felt bittersweet and overall, it brought me comfort while reading it. It was cheesy, I know. But I still enjoyed it.

I appreciated the theme around the ""meaning"" of life and how we define success. By pursuing success and by being driven by egoistical motives, we start to lose ourselves. We are trying to give a meaning to our lives, to find our purpose in this world and by doing so, we're starting to stop appreciating life for what it is. We are not able to see the forest for the trees and we underestimate the importance of the little things that are making as feel happy and content. And as the book says:

>*Never underestimate the importance of small things.*

There have been times in my life when I too have felt remorse for some of the things I have or haven't done. I have felt remorse for getting a bad grade when I knew I could study more and do better. I have felt remorse for fighting with my sister over something insignificant. I have felt remorse for saying bad things to my mom during a heated argument. True, compared to Nora or other people's regrets, mine may seem unimportant. But at the time, they still made me feel bad and I wished I could change them. However, as time went on, I have come to accept that I can't change the past. What I should do instead is try to develop more as a person and live my life in the fullest. It sounds cliche. I know. But it's something which is worth to remember. It's pointless to try and change our past decisions, no matter how we feel about them. What we can do is learn from our mistakes and try to fix them. Yes life can be bleak. And it's not going to be easy to just get over our hardships. But there is a possibility of a better future, if we manage to take matters in our own hands. To seize our own day.

As much as I enjoyed reading the book, as I already mentioned above, it wasn't exactly what I expected. This is one of the cases when the author has a good idea but the execution is lackluster. The concept of the book was very good and unique. It could be better, though. At one point, the plot became quite repetitive. Nora's lives followed the same structure and during the middle of the novel, they became quite predictable and monotonous. I still had fun while reading them but I was quite close at skimming some parts. I think that it would have been nice if we had more chapters like the first ones, before Nora entered the library. There was much telling and not showing when it came to her past and the relationship with her family and while that was not necessarily bad, it would have been more effective if they were presented in a different way. 

The plot would have definitely benefitted from more action, especially during the middle. Although the book was fast-paced, at one point I stopped caring a little because I knew that nothing remarkable would happen. The plot twists in Nora's lives lost their charm and the story was going around in circles. I would have prefered it if the book had focused in fewer lives and if some themes had been explored more.

The characterisation in this book was quite bland. The only character I got to know better was of course Nora but even she wasn't that fleshed out. Of course the book describes her worries, her struggles with her mental health, her developement. I sympathised with her, I felt proud of her developement but overall, I didn't have strong feelings about her as a person. She was read like a shell of a person at times. She would live a different life, realize that she didn't like it, have a short conversation with Mrs Elm and conclude that she had been wrong about what would be the best for her. Her journey to self reflection could have been handled better and she could have. As for the rest of the characters...well, they were kinda forgettable. Mrs. Elm was the typical type of character who is there to give advices to the main characters and be a mentor to them. And I couldn't bring myself to care for the rest of the others.

When it came to the writing, although it was good, it became kinda corny with all of these deep and intellectual quotes. I understand what Haig's goal was and as I already said, many of them made me think a lot. But they could have been toned out. At one point, I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and despite the warm feelings it caused me, it was quite boring and surface-level. 

Despite my criticism of the novel, I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The ending made me cry a little and I finished the book with a smile on my face. Granted, it was not the best book I've ever read but it was okay and I by no means regret reading it. It was a very cozy autumn read and I could see myself revisiting it in the future if I wanted to read something light-hearted and easy-going. I wouldn't recommend it as a life-changing read but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. After all, books are unpredictable. You don't know what you will like unless you'll try it. Just like most of the things we're doing in our life.

So, The Midnight Library didn't change my mindset. But it made me re-value my life and it encouraged me to continue to live in the best way I can. I might not now what is going to happen tomorrow, in one week or in a few years. But one thing is certain:

I'm going to try and live every minute of it.",2024-11-04 07:04:43

books,1gkfmfe,Industry reluctance/inability to offer a complete digital experience with books as a medium ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gkfmfe/industry_reluctanceinability_to_offer_a_complete/,16,"I'm new here so I hope this meets the subs standards for posting.

Going right into it, seeing the post about ""Report finds ‘shocking and dispiriting’ fall in children reading for pleasure"" it made me want to voice a bit of my own frustrations with attempting to re-engage with reading. I used to actively read multiple books a week as a kid growing up throughout my primary education up until I graduated Highschool.

Then I pretty much had to immediately join the workforce afterwards. This put my free time to read at a limit, and my interaction with a place where books would be readily available or encouraged to read at a minimum.

Despite engaging with daily reading material, News Articles, published research papers and consistently taking a wealth of written knowledge thanks to the rising increased usage of the internet in the encroaching digital era my reading stamina for longer form content was shot after a decade of just not reading books outside of the occasional gift or recommendation.

The last year, year and a half I wanted to start prioritizing reading more, and so I went back and reread some of my favorites, and some new books that I found interesting. Something that helped me pick up that reading stamina and stay engaged despite the countless other forms of entertainment/distractions was Audiobooks.

Specifically reading alongside audiobooks, I could engage with the material despite being exhausted after work, and even used it when relaxing, be it reading along with the material as the audiobook is going, turning the audio book off and reading myself to a specific chapter and picking the audiobook back up when I get tired of reading, It just made it a more engaging, less intimidating experience to get back into, but the problem with it is the system for digital books is not set up at all to help encourage or support utilizing the features like this. The only thing I found that offers support for this is the android Amazon app on a mobile phone, in which the Kindle app can detect if you own an audible book and actually follow along word for word with the audiobook. However the official kindle devices don't even support this feature now, and it's unlikely to see continued support.

Why I bring this up with the first part of this post ""Report finds ‘shocking and dispiriting’ fall in children reading for pleasure"" is because for other popular media sources, Films, Movies, Television, Videogames, even certain YouTube creators, you all have subtitles alongside the visual experience, and the audio experience.  It utilizes all the senses, you can put a movie in on the background, if you don't understand something you can look over read the subtitles and pick up on it, and that already has other sensory context clues to engage the one interacting with it.

For popular releases, and really anything with audiobooks it's a shame the medium isn't set up in way that marriages the reading and listening experiences together so you can control the pace at which you're either listening, or actively reading and engaging with the text. Both are mentally stimulating in some ways, and for some fiction books that utilize a lot of fantasy language, or text it just plain doesn't make sense that someone who has the audiobook can't have access to the resources that explain the text. There are also some books that utilize 4th wall notations in the columns of the books, or author notes that don't get translated into the audiobook.

For business, contractual and monetization purposes they separate books entirely from it's oral renditions, as there is more money to be made in selling them as separate products, but I think that really hurts the media as a whole from an accessibility standpoint, when other media forms have to by default include more interactivity and stimulation of multiple senses.

Tl;DR Just from an accessibility standpoint I think if they want to continue growth in readers in younger generations, or even just even encourage those who used to reads to pick back up the hobby, they need to find a way to make engaging with reading as simple as opening up a streaming service, or playing a dialogue heavy RPG for the average consumer, and I think offering a platform that combined E-Books with Audiobooks in a simple way cross-platform would absolutely be a push in the right direction. Something you can pick up mute and read on the go, or pause put on speakers close your eyes and listen to at home, or just follow along with by just bookmarking where you previously left off reading would go a long way to help make the hobby more open to all while embracing the new digital format for a millennia old medium.",2024-11-05 19:53:28
books,1gj0o45,Have you ever taken a library book on vacation with you?,296,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gj0o45/have_you_ever_taken_a_library_book_on_vacation/,286,"I went back and forth about it before I went on a trip last month. I didn't want to lose it or risk damaging it. But I was in the middle of the book and didn't want to have to wait so long before continuing it. 

I grabbed the book at the last minute and I'm glad I did. I wound up reading some of it several evenings and it made a nice memory. Nothing bad happened to the book, and on the contrary, it came in handy. I pressed a leaf in it and brought it home as a souvenir!

Has anyone else taken a walk on the wild side and brought a library book on vacation with you?",2024-11-03 23:37:49
books,1gj2hss,Dune,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gj2hss/dune/,86,"Just finished Dune, the first book. I have had it on my list of ""to read"" since a long time ago. I had seen the movies, not the series, so somewhat of a spoiler there.

I thought it was mostly an easy read, with a bit of over explaining on some points and others just throws you into the scene with no advanced warning (beginning fo chapters).

I enjoyed the book overall, although I found the ending of the first book somewhat of a letdown. I think there should have been a bit more to it. My opinion only, but wanted to share it, as I've been getting into reading again in my old age from when I was a teenager. ",2024-11-04 01:06:30
books,1gkazpj,"The Great Gatsby, why make highschoolers read this?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gkazpj/the_great_gatsby_why_make_highschoolers_read_this/,72,"I (35M) recently re-read this because a high-schooler I knew was forced to read it. I read this in high school.

I thought there was so much historical information that couldn't be appreciated by a young person unless they are hyper-focused on this specific era.

It also feels like this book glorifies things like infidelity, strong alcohol use, lying, etc. It brought me back to the days when I was drinking heavily. (Thankfully I'm sober now.)

There is some nice, flowery language, and there is a good vibe about the whole book. I enjoyed it. I feel there's got to be much better books to force children to read in high school.",2024-11-05 16:40:38
books,1gioxz1,What is magical realism?,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gioxz1/what_is_magical_realism/,194,"I have a theory that books fall on a spectrum of magical realism instead of just being an either or situation. I’ve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I’ve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It’s such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it’s magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that’s why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? Of course I can google this, but I also want to have a discussion on this, plus google’s answers aren’t very satisfactory

edit: typos

edit: Babel isn’t magical realism",2024-11-03 15:08:24
