relationships,1gq43cs,My (F45) BF (M41)of 5 years refuses to leave despite numerous attempts to get him to go. ,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq43cs/my_f45_bf_m41of_5_years_refuses_to_leave_despite/,59,"I have been in a relationship with my bf for 5 yrs. We have no children together and live in a house that my parents own. I pay the rent every month. As time has gone by, I have become increasingly unhappy in our relationship and I have on many occasions made this very clear to him. He ignores me when I ask him to leave, tells me he loves me and wants to work things out, he can make me happy and has nowhere else to go. Then he cries. I, in turn, tell myself that maybe this time things will improve and I can put up with our “roomates” relationship. We haven’t been intimate in over 2 years. He is always watching porn and pleasuring himself which has lead to a non existent sex life. We don’t kiss, hold hands, hug or have any physical contact. We simply exist, day after day, in my home. He is content with the way things are and doesn’t understand why I’m so unhappy. I honestly have given serious thought to moving out of my own house just to give myself some time to figure out how to get him out. I feel like I’m stuck in this vicious cycle of insanity where I don’t know what to do. He refuses to hear anything I say about breaking up or not being together. 

TL;DR. I’m stuck in a miserable relationship with someone who refuses to move out. ",2024-11-13 03:49:42

I’m having a hard time even getting out of bed. I can’t feed myself, and the most I can do is stumble to the bathroom. It’s humiliating. My kids, bless them, are helping me with the smallest things, like getting water or bringing me crackers. But they’re so young, and they can’t do much else.

Yesterday, I had to go pick up my kids, take them to the doctor, and grab some prescriptions. By the time I got home, I was shaking so badly I almost couldn’t make it up the stairs. I asked my fiancé to help by picking up the kids, but his response was, “I’m not picking up your fucking kids!” 

I asked for help again to pick something up from the store, and got the same response.

Maybe I’m just being overly emotional, I’m not sure. But this sickness is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. It’s terrifying, struggling to breathe and feeling so weak. I just want a little understanding, but all he does is sigh, scoff, and curse at me. I’m getting really scared that I’m just going to fade away because I literally can’t gather the strength to do anything.

TL;DR! - My fiancé is refusing to help me in even the most basic ways while I’m sick with pneumonia. I’m feeling hopeless and unsure if I have a right to be upset.",2024-11-13 09:02:14
relationships,1gq0nm8,How do I (38F) convince my coworker (55F) not to use holistic medicine for her cancer?,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq0nm8/how_do_i_38f_convince_my_coworker_55f_not_to_use/,51,"Me (38F) and my coworker (55F) have worked at the same school for 9 years now. We hired in at roughly the same time (she was a month before me IIRC), and we have been work buddies since.

I have been fighting cancer for two years now. Mine is stage 4, it cannot be cured, the best we can do is hope for an eventual diagnosis of ""No Evidence of Disease"" (NED).

My co-worker has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Since I have been fighting cancer for two years already, she came to me right away for advice. I told her the best thing to do at first is get the tumor removed, then meet with an oncologist to talk about an MRI and PET scan to make sure it hasn't spread. If it's localized and only stage 1, she might not even need treatment beyond surgery and the body scans to make sure she's in the clear. 

A couple weeks later, she started talking about holistic medicine with me. I made my stance on holistic medicine clear: it's fine for treating side-effects (like I even use peppermint tea to help with my nausea), but I would never, EVER use it instead of modern medicine. I would be dead by now without modern medicine. (median survival time without treatment for my type of cancer is about 6 months.)

She didn't seem too convinced though, and I'm worried about her. I explained what happened to Steve Jobs, how he had a very curable form of cancer but ended up dying because he used holistic medicine. She didn't sound convinced in the slightest, and I don't know what to do. I like my co-worker and I know she has teenage children, and I don't want her to get drawn in by holistic medicine and die because of it. What do I do?

**tl;dr**: My co-worker has cancer and is looking into holistic medicine to treat it, which I think will absolutely kill her. How do I convince her not to do that?",2024-11-13 00:55:39
relationships,1gpwftw,Video games are ruining my brothers life,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpwftw/video_games_are_ruining_my_brothers_life/,49,"Hello all,

I (27M) am growing concerned with my (22M) brother’s habits and lifestyle. 

He, like most people his age in the US, is still living at home. He has never had any real interpersonal relationships outside of family his entire life. 

He is up till 5 AM most mornings playing video games and clapping/wooting like a 10 year old.

Recently, The family banded together and got him to do something productive and help guide him towards being a positive member of society by helping him get a part time job and enrollment in school.

Now it’s the end of the first semester and he’s failed half of his classes and doesn’t seem that bothered by the whole thing.

My parents and us siblings are really worried about him and we don’t know what to do to help him at this point.

I know a lot of folks are just gonna say, it’s just games and let him live his life or whatever, but my parents cannot keep him forever and eventually it’s gonna fall on us siblings when everything goes south.

Please be considerate of the fact I am just trying to help and not trying to judge anyone.

TL;DR: Brother seems to be socially delayed or refusing to participate in regular society and I don’t know how to help.

relationships,1gptzm1,My dad (60M) thinks my husband (35M) is cheating on me,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gptzm1/my_dad_60m_thinks_my_husband_35m_is_cheating_on_me/,20,"TLDR: Dad thinks he's found evidence of my husband's cheating... 

Background: My parents keep an small empty apartment in a different city, where my aunt also lives. She has the keys to the apartment. My husband (35M) was visiting the city for business in August, and stayed at the apartment for 5 days. My aunt let her in and locked the doors after he left. My dad (60M) went to check on this apartment last week, and called me very seriously yesterday and told me that my husband had cheated on me. The evidence includes: 1) the two dining table chairs are now next to each other, as opposed to facing each other 2) he found lots of long hair, everywhere - my husband has a crew cut 3) the apartment smells oily, like someone has been frying stuff in there 4) there's some oily residue on one of the pot lids 5) my husband previously told my dad that he left a souvenir plate in the apartment from a company he was visiting for business, because he couldn't fit it in his luggage, and my dad implies that my husband may be cheating with someone at this company and received this plate as a gift.

My dad has concluded that my husband has cheated on me, and told me to be polite when breaking the news to my husband. I am not mad at all, actually I found it ridiculous...because I know my husband too well to find this plausible. I did ask him if he's aware of any of these things happening, and he said that 1) he set up his temporary work station on the dining table 2) he did not cook at all (and my parents know that - he has 0 ability to cook) 3) he met with the company's executive team and that's why he got a souvenir 4) if he had wanted to cheat with anyone, it would have made a lot more sense to get a hotel room, then to bring a girl back to his in-law's apartment, have her cook in my dad's kitchen (!!), etc. 

I asked my dad whether he has asked my aunt if she has used this apartment in the months leading up to my husband's visit, and the months after his visit. He said no he hasn't asked. I told my dad to check the surveillance camera, and he said will. My husband thinks it's laughable and wants to talk to my dad to clear it up. I'm looking for advice on how to proceed - should I have my husband talk to my dad now? I feel like he's made up my mind on my husband cheating, so it's quite an awkward situation...Thanks guys!

relationships,1gq2a6p,Feeling lost in my relationship ,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq2a6p/feeling_lost_in_my_relationship/,37,"I'm 36f and my boyfriend is 42. I'm so confused lately as to what the hell is going on in our relationship and sometimes I feel like I'm the crazy one. 


We recently went through an unplanned pregnancy (that he didn't want) that ended in miscarriage. We also moved in together around that time, it's been about 3 months. During that (before the miscarriage) he also bought a house for us.

We've been together 2 years (met 6 years ago) and I'm very serious about wanting marriage and children. He says he wants these things but is on no timeline and since the miscarriage says ""I want a baby more than I want him""

He has a very addictive personality and living with him has been difficult. I'm a clean person and like to take care of myself and my home. He has struggled with alcohol, vapes nicotine and is high almost all the time. He's messy and dirty and I'm almost always cleaning up after him, especially his sticky 3am high binges. He feels like I'm a nag when I have to tell him that I can't live this way.

His latest addiction is video games. For weeks now he plays them all evening, we spend very little time together. Stays up until 3am and sleeps on the couch. He only sleeps a few hours every night. This past weekend he literally stayed up all night and didn't eat or shower. When I brought it up tonight he says that I'm being needy and that it's my problem and selfish of me because ""he can't meet my needs right now?"" On top of being ""needy"", I did just have a miscarriage a month ago and emotionally I feel so alone but I think he thinks I should be over it by now?

We are currently living in a condo that I own and in 3 months has not really cleaned anything and thinks it's a big deal that he started cleaning up after himself in the kitchen and emptying the dishwasher. I work 3 days a week/12 hr shifts and tonight he tells me that the days I'm working he walks my dog and cleans my dishes out of the sink (I'm out of the house for 15hrs those days). And seems to think he should get an award for that. Every weekend I change the sheets on our bed, clean the floors, clean the bathroom and the whole kitchen. I cleared out the entire second bedroom for him since he works remotely and i dont say a word about the condition it's in. He also hasn't contributed to any bills and I've let it slide because he was buying this house for us.

A lot of my concerns aren't even about my needs but about the status of his health. Not sleeping, poor diet, poor mental health, vapes, Marijuana and Adderall. He does maintain a very good job and makes good money though.

On top of everything lately he doesn't want to do ANYTHING. Watch a show together, take a walk together, go grocery shopping. Nevermind a date. And he claims he doesn't want to spend any money because of buying the house so I don't expect anything anytime soon. Traveling used to be everything to me and he has no interest and won't even compromise because it's important to me.

I'm wondering if I should just walk away. I'm starting to wonder what the positive things of the relationship are. We are supposed to move into the new house in the next couple weeks which is an hour and a half from home. 
I feel like I am never going to get what I need in this relationship.

There have been times when things are good, or he'll make changes for a little while (like for the 2 weeks we thought we were going to have a baby) but I'm just seeing the pattern now. He can be thoughtful, sweet and affectionate at times. He's very smart and funny. He's also making me feel crazy like maybe I'm asking for too much? Telling me that whenever he tries that I always ask for more.  Also that he thinks it's totally ok to basically go MIA in a relationship for 2 weeks (he's home but just either high or playing video games) and that I'm needy by needing attention in that time frame. Idk am I asking for too much?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is emotionally unavailable, addicted to anything and everything at different times, and dismissive of my needs. I want marriage and kids, but I’m wondering if I should leave.

I thought we’re okay, really didn’t think through about any unsatisfying aspect of our relationship.

He seemed happy all the time… and we’re great friends, he is actually the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. 

Anyways, he sent me multiple texts while I was asleep confessing the situation. I just saw it when I woke up. I honestly didn’t know what to respond. I wasn’t mad, just disappointed, with a lot of questions.

I called him and he was already crying. He told me it was during a moment of weakness. I said “that’s bullshit, talk me through why you thought it was okay to do that”.

He explained that he felt sexually unsatisfied, and that is no excuse, but he just had a fight with his best friend and casual sex was a way for him to feel better. He told me it was not worth it and that sex with me is great he was just confused. He said “this is not at all about you, I don’t even deserve your forgiveness. Take your time and make a decision for us, please”. And then we stopped talking.

Well, I honestly don’t think about getting back together with him. But I have so many questions right now… it’s so confusing because I am not really angry, I don’t even feel jealously. And the worst is that he sounded really genuine… He didn’t hide it from me, he said it meant nothing and I believe him. It is just not smart to stay in this situation.

What do you guys think it’s happening for real? Have you been in a similar situation? I really cannot see this event outside my point of view. Please be kind to me and to him. 

TLDR: my boyfriend cheated on me, told me right away, says he regrets, I will probably break up, but I want to understand this situation better, am I missing something? Please be kind to me and to him.",2024-11-13 11:02:18

I don’t have a close relationship with my own family, and my partner doesn’t have much interest in being around them either. For my mental and emotional well-being, I feel it’s better to keep some distance from my family.

Because of this, we see my boyfriend’s family a lot. Whenever we visit his immediate or extended family, I notice that their attention is solely on him. They ask him all the questions and focus on catching up with him, to the point where it feels like I’m almost invisible in the room.

I understand that they’re naturally more interested in him since he’s their family, but it still feels tough when I’m not acknowledged or included in conversations. Right now, I’m on a family trip with them, and they haven’t asked me a single question about myself. I try not to take it personally, since they’re excited to see him, but I often find myself wondering, “Why am I even here?”

I love learning about his family and hearing about their lives, but since we see them so often, I end up zoning out because the conversations rarely include topics I can contribute to. It’s starting to make me feel drained and disconnected.

TL;DR Boyfriends family never seem to show much interest in me. My question is: Has anyone else felt the same? How can I handle these situations better? thinking i should spend less time going to/at these family gatherings..",2024-11-13 07:18:36

Next day her friend sat beside me which I thought was  test for me that do I talk with all girls the way I talked to her so I didn't talk to her in same manner. After that we met the following week and no conversation happened though I think she was looking at me. After that, we met next to next week and we had a fun short conversation but that's just it. Then we met the following week and she wanted to start a conversation with me and I caught her looking at me numerous times and then next day to that we had a fun conversation which I initiated and I told her that I will text her at night but all I got was formal response but I guess she doesn't want to seem desperate as I showcase myself very judgemental and hard to impress in class(that has a backstory) I am almost losing my mind due to her mixed signals. I don't even know whether she is in a relationship or not. It could just be me imagining things but the way things happen which makes what I think seem as more true like her friends looking at me in a teasing manner as if taunting us for being involved in something romantic whenever we're conversing. Previously she used to watch my stories too but from a week she doesn't do that. Help me get some perspective.

I have an unhealthy pattern of overthinking things and would rather get steamy even if I don't exactly feel like it and this combined with feeling pressured to be intimate makes it difficult. 

  We started getting back on track after a lot of talking and things got back to normal, let's say.   
We were having a cute moment together and I was showing him my childhood game while we were snuggled in bed and we said that we have to go to the toilet almost at the same time, so we decided to go together. He almost immediately made a situation more steamy between us and I went for it.

 After we exited the bathroom and got back to his room he made a joke about that game and I thought that he wanted to continue it, so I showed him more of it. I felt like this could end badly, but I didnt think about it too much. When I was leaving, I could tell something is off so I asked him about it. He said he's just tired. But after a few hours we started talking about It and how he is disappointed that I just got out of being intimate in a way and thought that the game was more important. I feel shitty about the whole situation and I don't know what to do now. We had issues about me feeling pressured to get intimate because of things he said in the past (that 1-2 times a week is not enough; which was later followed by saying that it is enough to him...and it really confuses me) and I'm really working on trying to overcome being scared to say that I don't want to have sex.  
I don't know how to communicate about this situation and he is showing me he's deeply disappointed in my behaviour, even if I promised I'll try to change. I'd be grateful about any feedback.

relationships,1gqasa0,Feeling hopeless,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gqasa0/feeling_hopeless/,1,"Hey everyone,

I’m (20F) and currently in my first year of uni. My “bf”(25M) and I have had a complicated history that goes back five years. We’ve definitely had our ups and downs, and trust issues have always been the problem. We both thought that maybe now would be a good time to give things another shot, and even considered living together in my second year to see if things would finally work out.

But here’s where I feel torn and honestly just numb. I’ve noticed that some of his old behaviors haven’t changed, and I’m starting to question if they ever will. For a little backstory: in the past, he catfished me and younger girls online. He would get so many nudes from these girls lie about his age etc. Last night, I noticed he had looked up one of my flatmates on TikTok, which brought back so many painful memories and was a trigger to my PTSD. To make matters worse, I found out he has a s*x video of a friend on his phone which exactly is the kind of behavior he promised to stop, saying he’d change for the both of us and to make me “happy.” It seems like to me he has a satisfaction towards younger girls which I don’t understand why.

I’ve told him repeatedly that his behavior is unacceptable and, honestly, disgusting, but it’s like nothing ever changes. Every time I try to distance myself, he somehow finds a way back into my life. I feel like I’ve become so numb that I’m not even crying from hurt anymore just pure frustration.

I’m stuck and don’t know what to do at this point.

I 29F
My partner 35M
My SIL 29F

My husband and I live with his daughter (6F) he has full custody and I raise her like a daughter. We are really happy together and everything is great. My husband and his family are from another country and his mother was living with us till March when she came back to their country. The kid goes to school since 13 PM to 17PM so we were going to hire a nanny because we both work full time but my SIL was unemployed and had nowhere to live so she asked if she could live with us and take her to school till she finds a job, she only has to take gee to school, she was selling things online as an income. 
One month after she moved we noticed some things were missing, like a video graphics card for PC very expensive, some tools my husband used for job and some money. We had an employee who used to come once a week to clean all the house, we fired her thinking it was her fault (we paid her everything and we never told her why we took that decision). 
Times passed by and I started to notice this: 
My BC pills missing
My creams, clothes missing too 

I swear I thought I was insane, like I was losing my memory but one day my husband was off and when I ask why he tells me he thinks his sister is stealing us, same situation, money disappeared from his wallet and he was thinking he was losing his memory but now it's a lot of money and there are another tools missing (expensives too). Then I remembered once the kid tells me ""my aunt took money from your wallet"" and SIL acts surprised and says ""it was because I wanted to buy eggs"". So everything leads to the same path. 

We don't know what to do, we are very angry because we both work A LOT, we are stressed everytime now, hiding our things in OUR house because of her. I am MAD. But he talked to her and she denies everything (of course). We discovered she is dating a recluse who sees once a week in prison. My husband is afraid that if we ask her to leave she is going to end in the streets but she is not looking for job, not selling things online anymore, she only lies in the bed watching TV. We are both very stressed and he wants to tell his mum about this but he is afraid this is going to wreck the family. 

Any advice?

relationships,1gq5jse,"great guy, bad sex. please help!! :(",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq5jse/great_guy_bad_sex_please_help/,70,"hii im torn between a huge dilemma rn. so me (20F) and my bf (19M) have only been together for a few months but have the most amazing relationship. we spend almost every day off together and have SO much chemistry. i have lots of fun just being around him, we understand eachother on a deep level and i feel like i can comfortably be myself around him. we are both ambitious people and put emphasis on success and our futures, which is a trait getting rarer these days. hes extremely clingy, affectionate, romantic, very physically attractive and i couldnt ask for anything more. 

theres just one problem;

the sex. hes superr submissive, which not only makes things very physically awkward (hes 6’3 with a broad, muscular build; im 5’4 and thin/small figure.) but also mentally. i hate to say it but it almost makes me physically recoil at times when he acts submissively & dirty talks me as such. 

im a switch, but less of a dom than i originally thought i was. like.. 80% sub, 20% dom. so 20% of the time im actually enjoying the sex, but im mostly just tolerating it (or even wanting to physically recoil internally). 

we both have high libidos and are very kinky. hes into CNC (which ive politely declined), being tied up and helpless, humiliation, sex doll, ect ect. 

hes topped me a couple times near the start of the relationship and the experience was seriously mind blowing, like some of the best sex ive ever had. the fact hes so much bigger and stronger made it that much more amazing. 
but now that we’re more comfortable he wants me to dom every. single. time. hes made it a bit obvious thats the role he enjoys far more being despite previously stating hes a switch. not to mention his idea of being submissive is the whole “im your toy, just have your way with me” and pretty much starfishes the entire time with little to no reciprocation, i honestly get more out of masturbation. 

recently ive tried communicating with him that im not too enthusiastic about being the dom everytime, and would even just like to have sex as equals without the d/s dynamic. he said it was fine, but i could tell by his mood and reaction he was extremely disappointed by this.
hes not too into sex without the d/s dynamic and i dont want him to just service top me, but actually like it.

i wish i could enjoy it but i cant help but feel pretty disgusted seeing him that way. as soon as he acts submissive and helpless im completely turned off for the night and just fake my orgasms. its almost a physically painful reaction :(

along with the starfishing, he hardly initiates. 
my ex was wonderful with this. he was aggressive and passionate, always grabbing my waist and kissing me roughly. 
with this new guy his touch is so gentle, even when i guide him. theres no grabbing my body, pulling me in, making me feel sexy and wanted. 

this whole situation has gotten frustrating for me since i have a very high libido (i used to have hella hypersexuality issues) and sex is important to me in relationships. to me its a way of expressing and receiving love, shaping a stronger and more passionate bond, an intensity pure romance cant quite replicate. 

recently ive taught myself to completely separate the bedroom and the rest of our relationship, and its dramatically restored my interest, but ive been repeatedly rejecting sex since it kills my passion for him. but i feel bad since i dont want this to be a dead bedroom situation and i dont want to just leave him out to dry. 

im not sure what to do, i dont wanna immediately break up im really into him and havent had a connection this strong in years. i have very high standards and am often not too into people, all my relationships for the past couple years have been disposable to me. just toys to entertain me until the next best thing arrives, but for once i actually want something with this boy. im not sure what to do honestly 

TL;DR me & boyfriend are extremely compatible relationship wise with great chemistry, but i almost hate the sex. ",2024-11-13 05:13:39

What I have heard from a friend of mine that happens to work with my bf is that he said he wanted to f\*\*\* or A-frame (I guess it means threesome?) another mans gf in the bar and the other man got escalated and a fight almost broke out, he got kicked out for that. Now I heard about this two weeks later from said friend. When I asked my bf about it he said that he was just ""joking around"" and his story was that it was about a ""red head fat bartender"" (his exact words) in another bar close by. And his excuse to the crude joke is that he was with his buddies and it's just ""dude humor"". I myself am fairly hurt by this . He has been mad AT ME for the past couple days because of this which doesn't feel fair whatsoever. What advice would you give me?

Now I'm fully supportive of him studying but he is also cutting me off by deleting Instagram. I wanna be supportive but the truth is I'll just miss him sm :') 

My uni exams are also almost along with his exams so maybe it's good idea idk. I'm just conflicted because while I want him to stop watching reels and shit so he'll study properly, I also don't wanna let him go :') ik it's just for a while but still

Or l'm just as bad...?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gqau6h/26m_22f_4year_relationship_betrayal_trust_issues/,0,"Hi everyone, I’m a 26M, and my girlfriend 22F and I have been together for about four years. I’m struggling with betrayal and trust issues in our relationship due to a series of events that have deeply affected both of us. Things started when my girlfriend went out drinking one night, and while under the influence, she got physically close with a stranger. Tragically, the situation escalated in a traumatic way for her, and I stood by her, helping her heal from the experience.

Several months later, I found out that, shortly after that first incident, she reconnected with an ex and had an ongoing affair with him behind my back. They were physically intimate multiple times, like friends with benefits. This second discovery broke my trust completely and has left me feeling conflicted about the future of our relationship.

In my own hurt and confusion, I started doing things that were out of character, like looking at models on social media, saving pictures, and focusing on them in ways that, honestly, felt a lot like watching porn. She recently found out and became very upset, seeing this as equally hurtful to what she did. I’m aware that my actions were also hurtful and not justified by what happened, and I want to be fully responsible for them. Still, I feel lost, as I don’t know if her reaction is fair or if I’m being unfairly compared.

TL;DR: I’m 26M, my girlfriend is 22F, and we’ve been together for four years. After incidents of betrayal on her side and some reactive behaviors on mine, I’m questioning our future and whether her reaction is fair. I’d appreciate specific advice on dealing with this situation and how to navigate trust and forgiveness.

Request for Specific Advice:
I’m looking for advice on whether what I did really is as serious as she feels it is, especially given that it involved viewing social media images in a way similar to porn. I’d also like advice on how to rebuild trust or move forward. Is it possible to navigate through this, or am I being unfairly judged here? I’d really appreciate insights from anyone who has dealt with similar challenges in a relationship.

relationships,1gq7p73,Should I (23F) end my 4.5 year relationship with him (27M)? ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq7p73/should_i_23f_end_my_45_year_relationship_with_him/,7,"TL;DR: Bf always wants to be treated with love but seems to not appreciate it 

To begin with, both of us have tried ending the relationship but decide to work on it and stay together. His issue with me has always been that I put in no effort and don’t love him—the main things he brings up is that I never touch him as if I want him, I don’t kiss him (I love to kiss but i don’t like wet kisses, I don’t give him head and honestly its been months now since I last gave him head because thats all we can do since im a virgin; mainly physical stuff). He definitely is sex deprived but quite frankly, and I’ve openly communicated this, not only do i not think his hygiene allows me to want to do it anymore, nor does he build that intimate moment. He thinks it starts from the bed but for me i need to be in the right headspace and need to be treated nicely way before all that). I don’t think he’s ever tried to understand that. Seems like he has selective hearing and makes himself the victim in every argument. Anyways here is what has made me question whether its too late to fix this relationship:

  
I wanted to make him feel special. He always buys food so I thought I’d make him a nice dinner at my dorm. I told him to come at 7:30pm sharp because I didn’t want to occupy the shared space for too long and I didn’t want the food to get cold. I called him at 6pm and he said okay. Then 7:30 comes around and I call him to see where he’s at. He picks up and tells me he will be 20 minutes late because he was at gym and had to shower. I said that he didn’t have to shower. And his response was “right, not like you were gonna give me a blow job anyways”. It honestly ruined the whole event I had anticipated of being special and i told him to go home and hung up.

7:50pm comes around and I give another call. He picks up and lies to me saying he took a turn and went home. I was devastated. Couple minutes later he finally gave in and said he was joking but I didn’t find this funny. It was just making the situation more bitter. And I asked him why he has to ruin every moment by being like that When he knows I’m trying to do something nice for him. He then calls me saying he‘s here and I tell him to come to the entrance that is really close to my apartment. He says he’s waiting at the further one which is probably less than a minute walk. I tell him no, that I want him to just come to the closer one because I didn’t feel comfortable walking through the main lobby because there were a lot of people and i was wearing a tight shirt without a bra so I honestly didn’t feel comfortable. He says okay. He arrives and we silently go up the elevator. Then i open my dorm room and the room is dark but there’s a candle and flowers in front of him. But I dont think he saw it and walks past it. So i turn the light on still no expression. I tell him to sit down and that Ill bring the food. I place the candle and flowers where he’s sitting and he says no you dont need to do all that. But I tell him that I’m trying to make it special. And then he looks at me and asks me why I made him walk out in the rain, that if I cared about him i wouldn’t make my loved ones go through that. 

I didn’t know what to say and said I was going to bring the dinner. I place his dinner on the table and mine on the bed. He sits down and goes on his phone. I take it away and say it’s a phone-free zone, that why can’t we enjoy this moment together. He then asks to join me on the bed and eat and I say fine. He started to see that I was visibly upset because honestly his reaction to everything was so underwhelming, and he tried to comfort me and started showing appreciation (I feel like he only really comforts me when he sees me crying or upset). After eating we watched a movie and after that I just couldn’t sleep. I felt like my body didn’t want to fall asleep beside him, i wanted him to leave but obviously couldn’t say it. I then asked what time he was gonna leave in the morning and he said around 8am. I said I’ll put the alarm on and got his phone and asked for the passcode (he has never let me see his phone). He gave me the numbers but it didn’t;t work. He said that that was weird because its the right code and took the phone from my hand and chucked it on the floor and shoved my head against the bed so I couldn’t move (in a “playful” way) and told me to go to sleep (I was low key very fidgety that night because i coudn;t sleep). 

  
Next morning alarm goes off but we continue to sleep. Then it’s 10am and I tell him he needs to leave. Honestly I was still upset with how the night went that I didn’t want him to be there. He still doesn’t leave. Then it turns 11am and I tell him he needs to go. He says he would leave when I leave and I give a firm no. He finally starts to leave and then I realize maybe I was too much so I said sorry, that I was just upset from how I tried to make everything special but it didn’t turn out like that at all. And he said smth along the lines that it would have been special if i did smith that he liked, that all this extra stuff that I was doing wasn’t needed. 

  
At that point, I was baffled and hurt and said no more and let him leave. 

  
I know that he may have another perspective on it and that I’m not perfect. But I have been trying but I don’t think he even cares anymore even though he keeps reassuring me that he does love me. But then he never communicates his feelings. It’s when I start bringing up something that hurt me, he starts to dump stuff from the past.",2024-11-13 07:38:26

recently after finding out i’m pregnant, i guess you could say my eyes have been opened to issues in my relationship. my boyfriend used to be really sweet and considerate towards me but recently i’ve noticed he never goes out of his way to make me happy. every time we’re home together, he’ll either watch youtube on his phone, scroll through tik tok, be on his game, or invite his friends over. and i’m not saying this is every “once in a while” i mean like this is happening every day. i’ve brought it up to him and i’ve told him he’s mean to me and that’s the only time i THINK he’s ever considered changing and prioritizing me but it was just talk, he never actually changed and went out of his way to do the things he said he was going to do for me. 

anyways, i have not had sex with him in like 3 weeks, we have time, there’s always time, but i just never feel myself getting aroused by him and i have no idea what to do next.

My gf 38F and I 38M have been together for 5 years. Tonight we broke up after living together for the last 5 years and  decided to remain friends; she was my first real relationship as an adult and second relationship ever previous relationship was 20 years ago. I had over served myself on Marijuana edibles and smoking several joints during the day and it just slipped out when she got home. SHE WAS SOBER.  This has all been a long time coming.  The events of the next 5 hrs are a roller coaster...buckle up. 

After a few minutes of awkward silence We almost immediately started joking around and started talking and laughing about Disney movies/characters like old friends. We share an awkward laugh; and I tell her that ""this is all I ever wanted from her"" to laugh and talk like this and ""it's stupid that it took breaking up to get it.""

She then starts asking me to help her hang a tapestry; asking if I was ok with the placement and to take care of her dog.

 I'm like ....""WTF are you serious?! I'm no longer in this equation""

She agrees. Next we are talking about sex and her being my Wing woman to get me laid..... (◕⁠‿ʘ)

We then start talking about what we could have done different in the relationship sexually and outside the bedroom.  AGAIN. WHAT IVE BEEN ASKING FOR THE WHOLE TIME!

It's getting late and I asked her;  ""Where would she like me to stay while we figure out where I am going.  Unsure of a solution we avoid it by getting back to conversation she keeps driving the conversation back to her sexual needs. As a man my libido is in overdrive with the subject matter and we had to laugh because I was getting aroused.

Jokingly I said ""Fuck it. Let's put the cherry on top of this cluster fuck of a break up and have sex one last time.""  Wrapping it up after a 2hr session she said that she enjoyed me being dominat with her

Which pissed me off because that's exactly what I've been trying to do for the past 5 years but she would try to be dominant over me in those situations. I scream at the top of my lungs. "" My fucking God! How the Fuck do you expect anyone to hit that moving target. You can't be both submissive and dominant at the same exact time.""

At this point it's 1am and she tells me she's going to take a shower. By this point I have zero clue what our status and just want to be 100% sure what the status is and she tells me to get some sleep and we can talk about it tomorrow after she gets home from work and dinner. 
She then tells me before drifting of to sleep she will start allowing me to be the dom in our relationship.
 Like WTF.   Seriously don't know if I'm single or in a relationship...... This sounds toxic but I'm really still high and confused about everything.",2024-11-13 11:15:25

We don’t have any major arguments, just the occasional disagreement, and I’m really happy with him.

However, his anxiety has started to surface in a big way during intimacy, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

He has been diagnosed and has a therapist, and I know logically that he can't control his anxious thoughts when they arise. I try to be understanding and supportive in our everyday lives, but lately, when we're intimate, it feels like I’m often just comforting him rather than enjoying the moment.

The actual physical part of intimacy is fine—I have no complaints. But if I’m not vocal enough, he starts calling himself a ‘stupid failure’ who can’t please me. Then, I have to hold him and reassure him that he’s not a failure, and that I’m not leaving.

If I’m too vocal, he thinks I’m ‘faking it to make him feel better,’ and once again, it becomes my job to comfort him.

Either way, we end up stopping for the night, and it’s been really tough.

I came out later in life, and Alex was my first in many ways. Being intimate with him is a big emotional vulnerability for me, and I don’t know how to handle it when this happens.

I want to be supportive, and I know this isn’t about me, but I’d love advice on how to approach this. We definitely need to talk about it, but I’m scared that if I do, it might send him into a spiral.

TL;DR:  My boyfriend struggles with anxiety about performing during intimacy. I have no complaints about sex, but he imagines that he’s failing, and it turns into me just comforting him. How can I address this?""",2024-11-13 07:29:21
relationships,1gq5cra,I (29F) feel guilty for wanting to leave,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq5cra/i_29f_feel_guilty_for_wanting_to_leave/,21,"So I, 29f have been in a relationship for 10 years with my partner 33m. Think of it this way, I'm young and this is my first and only real relationship I would say. 

I really need advice before I sink into darkness. In summary I have no love, no feelings but distrust and resentment for my partner, but I feel like I can't leave.

To set the scene, I was so In love with him from the jump. I had no eyes for anyone else and I was so proud to have him. My family loved him and everything seemed great. I'm not a jealous person, so he would hang out with his people and I would do my thing. No biggie right? 🤣 wait for it....

So I got pregnant pretty young (don't feel sorry for me, ya girl still handled business😜) and it was all cool until I started feeling like he was messing with his 'bestfriend' let's call her Kitty, but I had no proof. There was shady situations, but I'm not the type to take things and run with it. So anyway, I let it slide. Mistake #1

We carry on and I see things toxic since the baby and I'm feeling...meh but I continue because I love him. He gonna spend all his time with the bros while the baby and I are elsewhere and then gaslights me into thinking I'm just making a deal out of nothing and he isn't gone as much as I say he is...but other people see it too. Mistake #2

So baby #2 comes round and it's much of the same and at this point we have been having physical altercations, all of which he says I caused but yall I was beat tf up. ( not while pregnant and ill add that it wasnt a regular thing either, far and few between and our son is completely unaware but it happened) but I stay because who am I to break up my family? I mean faults aside, he's genuinely not a monster. He's a good dad and a caring good man in ways, I know it sounds crazy but I don't know how to explain it. Think Jekel and Hyde? Mistake #3

I tried to prevent this baby. Birth control prescription was a little late, I was told I would be covered anyway, but I still went and took a plan B. Well, I guess God had plans but knew it was a terrible idea. We were not in a good place and I just was not ready. I thought of not having the baby but I knew I couldn't do it from the jump, I was kidding myself with the idea. Anyway I go through the pregnancy and everything was great, he's the supportive good dad, still goes out a lot though. I have the baby and the first thing he said to me was awfully offensive regarding the baby but I dismissed it as bad humour and we went on with our lives.

Fast forward to like 2 months after the baby, he decides to go out. My mother wanted to have the babies so I decide to go out too but with my girls. We come back in, he's drunk but not like totally wasted. We get to it doing what grown folk do. He gets up, he going to the store, long story short, I found out that he actually went to see some other girl (I suspected and he couldn't deny it) so I tell him to leave and never come back. The girl says that she was drunk and doesn't remember anything but said she thought we were over. He doesn't leave, and I can't leave so we continue living together and I put on a face for the kids but ignore him otherwise. We stop being intimate for the most part.

He then goes out of town for business and I tell him to go get tested and he does....( now sir if you're faithful, why you need a test?) Anyway, I let it go. Months later we get into a huge fight and he admits he bought a 'night walker' if u feel me.He says he did it because I wasn't giving him enough of what he needed. So I'm like boy I'm not stupid but he sticks to his story. In this time I find out he was also laying up with his friend. Yup. Yall remember kitty from the beginning? Not only that but he would talk to her complaining about me and all this mess. So I get an apartment and I leave with my kids. But this man begging for his life and his son missed him so much I felt like a horrible person. So yup....booboo the fool let him back in. Mistake #4...I mean are we still counting?

So fast forward to the present, I lost my job and had to move back in with him because the kids need him and we are living like we go together because he says he don't want no one but me ( apart from the fact that your name still be out there with all that mess even though I can't prove it) but the bottom line is, I can't want him. I know he's never been real with me and he probably still isn't. And even if he is, the ship done sailed. Like is that feeling ever supposed to go away? It's not like he makes me feel loved. I feel inadequate. He criticises everything I do. He's never wrong. I believe he might be a narcissist but then I sometimes think, maybe I am the problem  and I just can't see it. He's also done things like spread rumours about me, even telling people he wasn't sure if my kids were his before they were born which I was unaware of and shown friends inappropriate pictures/videos of us being intimate. Another thing I was unaware of and he still flat out denies.

My thing is, why am I still here? Why do I feel so guilty for the thought of leaving? Why do I feel like if I leave it will be the wrong thing? As I said, he's not a complete monster that would be a lie. I've sunken into depression and I'm barely hanging on... like there's so much more to it that I can't include but yea....I need to know I'm not crazy for wanting to leave but feeling like it will be the worst mistake ever. I dread being intimate with him and hate every moment of it....tell me I'm not crazy? What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with an unfaithful,  occasionally violent narcissist and I feel like I need to leave, but I don't know if it's the right thing to do. And if I do leave, how?",2024-11-13 05:02:08
relationships,1gqac5o,My (34F) Partner's (35M) Ex (40F) is struggling to move past their breakup a year on and it's becoming unmanageable.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gqac5o/my_34f_partners_35m_ex_40f_is_struggling_to_move/,0,"So I'll start by saying, we are all trying to be as open and supportive as possible, I have absolutely 0 problem with being friends with ex partners, and my partner's being friends with their exes. Some of my closest friends are people I have been in relationships and I truly believe it's possible because I've done it before. For context and legalities of home ownership we are in Australia.

My partner's ex, Ash, is still in the house they own together, has chronic health conditions and is financially dependent on my partner (Cedar) the problem is that since their breakup, Ash's condition seems to be going downhill. Their condition is very linked to their mental health, and right now she is extremely depressed to the point of being unable to feed herself, go to the shops, clean, manage the home, or get out of bed. She has a lot of health anxiety and her default condition is that she is down with something... a vomiting 'bug', the 'flu' a 'cold' and where these things are obviously distressing, Cedar is pretty convinced that it's anxiety and depression, not a constant rotating virus, that causes it.

We are now in a situation a year on, where Cedar is at his old house caring for her 3x a week. He cancels plans with me because Ash is unwell, or needs care. When I ask about the level of care he says 'it's not physical care, she just needs someone there. She is physically capable of cooking and cleaning. She just 'can't get out of bed'. 

I've always been supportive of him continuing to financially support her, it would be pretty poor form to just cut her off. However she does own half a large home through their marraige and if sold she would be more than well off. The issue is financial management, home management, she basically cant/ won't do anything herself. This is a big part of why the relationship dissolved, the increasing pressure and demands on Ash who was working 3 jobs to pay a mortgage that Ash is named on, but doesn't contribute to. 

She refuses to reach out to anyone else and claims that Cedar is the only one who truly understands how to care for her. With her mental health at the moment she is isolating herself. Cedar is constantly worried about her and it's making him sick with stress too now. The knock on effect is that I also feel really anxious all the time. There's always some problem. Cedar and I planned a rare trip away for a weekend for my birthday, and Ash threatened to end her life the day before if he went. We ended up going after he turned up to calm her down, but the trip with full of anxious messages and worry.

I want her to be ok but Ash just can't walk away and leave her. She threatens self harm, she stops eating, it's bordering on manipulation because consciously or not, she knows the worse she is, the more Cedar is there.

I'm just at my wits end. I want Ash to be ok. Mine and Cedars relationship is great and we want to get on with building a life together. But it's been a year of stress thats effected my  life too, my work, my friendships, my energy levels are effected too. I think I'm realising that I've been depressed for over 6 months now. Which is nothing compared to Ash, I work, I pay rent, I have all of life's other stresses too.

What's also happening is that when Cedar is there, Ash takes the opportunity to grill him and air grievances, Cedar is already exhausted for his 3 jobs to pay her house off that he doesn't live in. Sometimes he can't sleep until 2 in the morning because 'big conversations' are happening with an extremely distressed Ash and Cedar feels he needs to soothe her.

I'm at the point where I just cant see a way out. I'm scared of her hurting herself or worse. I'm worried for Cedar who I love deeply. I am struggling with thus prolonged stress, and being unable to move on. He needs to distance himself, I do believe he's making it worse by prolonging this breakup but she's just.... so fragile.

I know the answer is 'cut her off, sell the house,  break ties' but it's just not that easy 
With someone who is registered as disabled (chronic fatigue). They are married and right now don't want to go through full divorce procedings if they can avoid it. It's also not my decision to make.

relationships,1gq7b58,How to forget someone without cutting ties with them?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq7b58/how_to_forget_someone_without_cutting_ties_with/,3,"I (23M) have known this girl (23F) for more than 4 years now - we studied the same Bachelor's Degree, and now we're studying the same Master's Degree. I liked her the moment I met her, but at the beginning it was mostly superficial and sexual. This went on for a few weeks, and then the pandemic hit. Fast-forward a few months and we started chatting (but in a friendly way). I got to know her better and I started appreciating her for her personality and intelligence. I started developing feelings for her and decided to ask her on a date, when the lockdowns end. I thought there was a spark between us.

When the lockdowns ended, I was about to ask her out, when I discovered that she had recently entered into a relationship with another guy from our university. This hurt my feelings and I distanced myself from her, even though I knew their relationship wasn't going to last, based on my observations on their characters. In the end, this was a good thing, because I took my rose-colored glasses off and realized the big differences between me and her. Her relationship lasted no more than 14 months, during which I managed to stay friendly, but distanced.

The start of this semester though, we have started getting close again. We help each other out in university and she also always chooses to sit next to me. Unfortunately, it turns out my feelings for her haven't evaporated and I'm starting getting attached to her again.

I don't like this. She's beautiful, smart and kind and I like her energy and radiance. There are very few girls like her. We share a similar taste for music, but we still have significant emotional and character differences. It is always me, who initiates the conversion (and that's OK), but if we stop talking when classes start, she never resumes the conversation during the break.

\- I can't ask her out on a date, because I don't want to waste time in a relationship that I know ultimately isn't going to work. Moreover, I don't have a job. Now is the time to work on my career. I don't even think she has any feelings for me.

\- I can't cut ties with her completely, because we are somewhat dependent on each other's help, as we barely know other students and since we can't attend all lectures at all times, we often exchange information and sometimes study together. I don't want to cut ties abruptly, as this may disturb her. I don't think I can do this gradually either, as I don't have the necessary willpower.

\- I tried partially reducing my interactions with her, but it doesn't work - I always reattach after some time.



The current situation is unpleasant for me. I am afraid my attraction is turning into love. I now care more about her soul than her body. I often find myself distracted and thinking about her, instead of doing what I am supposed to do at that particular moment. As a person, who has always been in full control of my life, this helplessness is driving me crazy. I am also afraid of determinate action, because I am recovering from an addiction and I fear that an emotional breakdown will bring me right back into the fold.



Is there a third, middle way, to handle this, other than asking her out or cutting ties with her completely?



TL;DR: I (23M) like this girl(23F) but I know deep-down we are incompatible. I am torn apart between asking her out and breaking ties with her completely. I don't like being distracted by thoughts about her. Is there a way to eradicate my feelings for her, so that I can go on with my life, without breaking ties with her completely?

relationships,1gqa3y2,Is it love bombing or is it real?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gqa3y2/is_it_love_bombing_or_is_it_real/,2,"
So we matched with a guy on bumble but didn’t meet for a 1-1.5 months later. The first date went well and it felt like the connection was organic due to the delayed meeting. He then wanted to see me the next day, and the next, and the next. We were both showering each other with affection, texting constantly and just being cute in general. I absolutely enjoyed this time and attention. We waited to kiss until the third date and felt like 16 year olds again. He told me he loved me a week into meeting me, which I know is absolutely unrealistic. However, I did feel intense bursts of affection and the need to say I love you to him too during our dates so didn’t pay much mind to it. We didn’t have sex until the 6th date and when we did it was nice.
However, after the sex he slowly started to retract and be more inconsistent with his affection and texting. He would alternate between being very cute or being very dry. I personally do not like this behavior and will always match the energy instead of chasing. This then caused him to freak out and made him spiral into thoughts that I was seeing other people (which in theory I/he can still do as we’re not committed). 

When I’m with him it feels very nice. We went to a party to his friends and he told me how important this is to him. His friends made comments about how he hasn’t stopped talking about me. One day his roommate made a comment adressing me as his new girlfriend. So overall this behavior makes me think he is interested, but his inconsistent affection on text tells me otherwise. Because of this I’ve been very confused and in my thoughts a lot and therefore also colder than I was during the initial days. 

Some red flags I noticed is how he always walks a few steps in front of me and thinks holding hands in public makes his ‘estrogen go up’. To me this is weird and makes me feel like he doesn’t want to be seen with me, which doesn’t make sense as he has told me over and over again how good I look and how he sees the way other man look at me. Another thing is that he always makes comments about whether I’m jealous or will be jealous about some girls, which I have told him that I’m not the jealous type. I see jealousy as insecurity and don’t see the point.

I just want to go back to the early days where the affection was there, but I can’t bring myself to go there probably due to the things that have happened to turn me off. I see myself wanting to get in a relationship with him, but I don’t even know him enough to want that which confuses me even more.
Sometimes it feels like he is more into the idea of being and seen with me than wanting to be with me, even though when we are together everything is very nice. I am just scared of it turning into yet another hook up when it was the first time it didn’t start like a hook up. For the first time I felt like it could go somewhere and still have the hope, yet I’m so scared of it only being about sex from
now on. This makes me be even colder to him.

I don’t even know what my questions are to fellow readers, but any kind of insight is much appreciated  

**TL;DR;** I matched with this guy on Bumble, and after waiting over a month to meet, our first date felt amazing. He wanted to see me constantly after that, and we both showered each other with affection and texts. I loved the attention, and we took things slow, waiting until the third date to kiss and the sixth to have sex. But after we slept together, he started pulling back—one moment affectionate, the next distant. I don’t chase, so I matched his energy, which led him to worry I was seeing others. He says he’s really into me and even introduced me to his friends, but little things, like him walking ahead or making comments about jealousy, make me wonder if he’s as interested as he says. I want to get back to how we were in the beginning, but I’m scared this will just turn into another hookup, even though it felt like it could go somewhere real.",2024-11-13 10:42:10

Neither of us have children, he and his ex had a clean break. Hes an extremely kind, genuine and respectful person and we have a great relationship. His actions do make me feel extremely cared for. I have no reservations other than not hearing those 3 words. 

Actions are of course incredibly important and I absolutely do not take that for granted. I have asked him where he’s at and he’s quite simply ‘not there yet’. In his own words, he’s naturally a slow burner and I imagine there’s still a deeper level of pain from his previous relationship.  Although we’ve been together for approaching a year. We previously dated for a few months a few years ago. Not long after his divorce. He wasn’t sure about his desire for children. Whereas I’ve always been sure. So I made a decision to end it. 

He has assured me that he is now open to it, which is when we resumed our relationship. 

I’m really struggling with not hearing the words as for me I don’t want to interpret his actions as meaning more. When it could just be that he treats me well because he’s a good person. I told him I loved him a few months in. He didn’t say it back, but gave me a lovely speech of how much I meant to him. So although I was dissapointed I was able to give him time following this. 

However almost a year in my patience is now running extremely thin. 

I almost ended the relationship recently  because I feel like I don’t have clarity about how he really feels and it’s eroding my excitement and passion for this relationship.  I’m finding that my own love for him is rescinding quickly. 

Should I leave? Would I be making a huge mistake? Or am I saving myself?

* In a 5-year relationship with a generally happy dynamic.
* Recently transitioned from a fintech job to full-time content creation, which my dream.
* Girlfriend is unsupportive, often doubts success, and compares content to top creators, making it emotionally challenging.
* Considering ending the relationship due to constant discouragement but feels conflicted because I love her so effin much.

I’ve (26M) been with my girlfriend (26F) for 5 years, and we’ve had a pretty happy relationship. Recently, I transitioned from working at a fintech startup to creating content online, and I’ve realized this is what I truly want to pursue full-time. I have about six months of savings set aside, enough to cover expenses, including those for my girlfriend.

However, she’s been very critical of my decision. Despite trying to explain that this is my passion, something I genuinely want to commit to, she just doesn’t seem supportive. She often hints that my content creation efforts will fail and that I’ll end up broke, which really brings me down. She also points out how my videos don’t measure up to “top creators,” which I understand—I know I have room to grow, and I’m working on it.

Lately, I’ve been considering ending the relationship because I don’t want to be discouraged or made to feel inadequate for following my dream. Still, I feel torn because I truly love her deeply.

I have never been in a relationship before, in large part because I was closeted and mentally unstable for most of my life.

My whole life I believed that love was conditional—that I had to be worthy of it—I had to be social, *useful* in some way shape or form, and always cheerful and never angry to be worthy of it. I've put in enough of the work to realize that isn't the case, but now I'm upset because I look around me and everyone seems to have someone. Everyone except me. I don't have anyone even after years of self-work. And I look at other people and I see that they're far from being healed, far from being ""worthy"" of love and attention, but they *do* have someone that loves them regardless. Is my suffering less than theirs? Is my effort less than theirs? Why can't I even receive a simple ""good job, you've worked hard"" from anyone? Everyone else gets a shoulder to cry on, everyone else gets an ""I understand, it must have been hard for you"". Everyone else has someone on their side that accepts them just the way they are. Why not me?

Whatever the problem with me may be, I don't have the right to judge whether someone is worthy of being loved or not especially when I've already acknowledged you don't have to become someone brilliant before you can be loved. I don't even know the people I'm judging.

How do I stop feeling entitled to a relationship?

TLDR: I'm jealous of other people being in love and being loved because I don't think they deserve that. I'm pretty sure I'm feeling entitled to a relationship after suffering for years on my own and finally being ""qualified"" for one. How do I stop that?",2024-11-12 18:17:46
relationships,1gq9v4p,I (35M) developed feelings for friend (28F) who is emotionally unavailable due to trauma,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq9v4p/i_35m_developed_feelings_for_friend_28f_who_is/,1,"Hello,

I (35M) have been in a long term relationship for 13 years that regrettably (or the way I see it now, for the better of both of us) ended last year. Since then I have worked hard to sort myself out and become happy with myself and my life. Do note I am on the autism spectrum - not obviously impaired but it comes with certain challenges in communication and social contexts.

4 months ago I made a new friend (28F) whos part of my friend group with whom I quickly developed what I felt was a deep connection. We got to see each other regularly (1-2 times per week) and at times spent hours on walks talking about our lives and most inner thoughts and feelings. I have a decent social circle but no one else in my life with whom it is so easy to feel safe sharing these things and who is understanding and sensible enough to communicate with me in a certain way that makes everything fall into place so easily. There seem to be no barriers like with many other people that I interact with and something is always coming back. She helped me through a rough patch through speaking about it alone. I appreciate her a lot.

I love her assertiveness. That she so easily puts down a strong word on her thoughts and opinions without disguising them like most people do. She is direct and honest, very strong and inspiring but can also show vulnerability and that way open the space for me to be. We share values in family and sustainability and have compatible aspirations. I do like her shiny, curvy hair, straight teeth that make a big smile that I won't forget in my life and her smell that makes every space she enters feel like spring time. I wish she would see herself the way I see her.

I developed feelings for her since I acknowledge these feeling as something special (for me, having a hard time understanding my own feelings to begin with) and would have liked to share more of a relationship with her than just friendship.

Unfortunately she is very troubled. She is from Israel (came here, to the West 2 years ago, no relatives nearby, only acquaintances and some friends), her birthday is 7/10 and this year on that exact day her pet that she had since childhood regrettably passed. She fell out of her usual routine (sports, activities that used to be very important to her) and has barely any savings to survive on. It hurt me a lot to learn these things and see her experience them and I can barely fathom the grieve and worry she must feel. Through our conversations before and around that time I clearly understand that she would not be letting someone into her life until she has herself figured out emotionally and mentally.

Since then she has withdrawn and specifically asked for 'extra space' to recover. We still sometimes see each-other as part of our friend group but it feels like she does acknowledge me as little as possible. These situations are awkward and a bit hurtful to me. We had no conversation or fight that would have caused this, it just happened one day. 

I respect her wish and have not made contact for the 3 weeks since we talked last but with every passing day I am hurting more for the passing friendship and person that I deeply care for and am emotionally invested in.I probably have to let go since it is not on me now to make this happen or not. These feelings just linger and come to light every now and then and pull me down bit by bit. 

How can I manage to move forward? What do I do if she gets in touch again?

TL;DR: Can't move forward from unresolved feelings for a female friend who is emotionally unavailable and withdrew from our friendship as she is dealing with traumatic events.",2024-11-13 10:24:33

My friend travelled from my city to another city yesterday, and i lost my bike parking ticket which he was supposed to take to reach to our room in that city. But i made all necessary arrangements to ensure he gets to use my bike by giving him all alternative documents copies. I don't know what he thought but he just got little upset why i lost it and didn't say anything else. 

Now i was in call with my girlfriend of 5 months yesterday night, and my friend called me after reaching his room. My girlfriend suddenly got angry who is calling me at midnight. Even after explaining it's my friend she was doubting me, so i added her also along with my friend for a conference call, as she already knows my friend as well. 

Now he was saying he reached his room, and suddenly out of the blue, he started to speak shit about me. He was saying i lost this ticket, I'm a careless person, i don't know how you are going to survive marrying him, and things like that. I never expected him to speak like this, esp to my girlfriend as we were already in an argument and were getting things back together, and he knew everything about all these things. This made my girlfriend even doubt me more, she was like if you can't even manage simple things, how can you take care of me? 

I just lost my mind yesterday. I knew i was careless losing this ticket, but it's not something to get this angry about and i even made alternative solutions for him so he can have a hassle free process. And its not even necessary to complain to my girlfriend, he could have straight up scolded me. 

I wasn't able to speak any further yesterday. Had huge argument again with my gf after the call and haven't spoken to him yet. 

What should i do now? 

TL; DR : My friend, me and my girlfriend were in a call yesterday, and my friend started talking shit about me to my girlfriend like I'm careless, how she is going to survive marrying me etc. Now my girlfriend is starting to doubt me again, i don't know what to do. ",2024-11-13 06:37:27

We work together, so we see each other at work and sometimes beforehand as I'll offer to pick her up.

Recently, she got a dog, and I knew when she talked about getting one that it would cause problems in our relationship as she's still living with family and would now be consumed by her. I don't have a problem with pets, but now we're essentially unable to make plans outside of work as her family doesn't want to take care of the dog. Even though we can't make date plans as often (we've gone out once since she got the dog, and it was planned before she got her), I didn't expect other things to change.

Lately I've been carrying any and all text conversations, and oftentimes will get left on read. I don't expect an immediate response, but eventually some response? Instead she'll ignore it and we'll talk about something else--they're not serious topics or anything, but I guess maybe she finds them uninteresting? Same thing with being left on delivered, she'll be online on tiktok and ignore my texts. Again, I don't expect an immediate response, but she only gets back to me when she has something she wants to say.

She wakes up before me, so I used to wake up to her texting me about things happening in her day, and now I'm the one that always has to start the conversation. And again, it often feels like she's not putting any effort into the conversation, and it's getting tiring trying to force a conversation.

I'm a fairly communicative person when it comes to emotions, and will try to always talk through concerns. She is not, so when she gets annoyed or angry with me she'll keep it bottled up. I understand talking through things can be annoying, but I believe that communication is key to a healthy relationship.

I spoke to her a few weeks ago about feeling unloved because we had gone through a really rough week where she was snapping at me (something she acknowledged), cursing at me over text (something she never used to do, but when I asked her why she said ""I can curse when I want""), and I mentioned how she hadn't told me ""I love you"" in a while. I had sent her a text that I concluded with ""I love you"" and she responded ""alright"", so I mentioned that and she said she didn't realize that and that it was an accident. But still after that conversation when we said goodbye, she still hadn't said it.

I was going to drop it because I felt like we had otherwise resolved our issue, but then the next day, she canceled on plans we had (we haven't been able to make plans since). That's when I mentioned that she still hasn't said it back to me even after we discussed it. She hit me back with ""I don't need you feeling some type a way about an accident."" That utterly crushed me. I'm always on the defensive whenever I bring things up, and I usually end up apologizing.

She's started saying love you again, but it just doesn't feel the same. I've tried getting past all this, but I can't help but notice she doesn't talk with me the same anymore.

The most recent thing that happened that finally made me make this post is we share our location with each other (this was her idea, though she didn't force me to do it, we both agreed), and I was left on delivered when we were mid-conversation, I noticed that she was at some random place for an hour-and-a-half, and when she got home she finally responded. I asked her if she'd been napping and she responded yes. I don't believe she was doing anything suspicious, but why lie? I'm not going to confront her about it, but I just don't understand.

I understand not wanting to be connected 24/7 (though she's pretty much always on tiktok, often hitting 8 hours of screentime), but now texting is the only thing we can do outside of work and she doesn't seem to care at all.



Tl;dr: Girlfriend often ignores my texts, and when we do talk she puts no effort into the conversations. I feel like I'm just bothering her by trying to talk. And now we can't go out together anymore because she got a dog that's consuming her off time.",2024-11-13 09:52:34

I'm 28F and Ive been in a relationship with my bf 32M for 2 years now. We live together. I am however, unsure if I can go on with it much longer.

He has always been pretty argumentative and had anger issues, but to a lesser degree- so did I. So I originally took on most the blame. When we met, I was struggling with having housing insecurity, was recently in a serious car wreck, and sort of generally having financial issues. Needless to say, I was very stressed and could be irritable. He made me feel like I was unreasonable and it was unfair that he paid for most the dates (even though I lived out of my vehicle that just got crushed to oblivion). So I would try to accommodate all his requests, for example, I stopped getting lunch at work so I could save enough to pay for a dinner date, I worked on and have mostly eliminated my temper and sort of general complaining about money. He has had six figures in the bank in savings and a supportive family, a lot of resources I do not have. I'm happy for him to have those things but I feel like he was not especially generous towards my feelings going through what I went through and made it about how he was affected instead.

Last year, I got a great job and finally had enough money to rent a place. So we moved in together. The arguments shifted from basically me being too horrible to be around due to all my complaining about money/ life into arguments about random things that are non issues to me. For example, he was livid one day because I wanted to get up early to go for a run, another time he screamed at me because I wanted to wait in line to buy merch at a concert and he was ready to go home. This happens probably 3x a week. Yesterday, I said I did not want to eat potatoes for dinner because I'm eating low carb and he lost his mind at me. This involved screaming, punching the table in front of me, and throwing the dining room chairs. all because I ""didn't give him the space to express his feelings about the adjustment"" The adjustment being: I am eating less carbs and his diet isn't changing at all.

Now that its been 2 years and I feel like I have put the work in to be the best person I can be, fix my financial issues and deal with my own emotional baggage, I feel as though I am not the problem. But he believes I am, and I don't want to try and convince him anymore. Do y'all think it's time to leave? Do you think I can salvage this or do you think I'm the problem as well?

hopefully this is a coherent story, there's a lot of info I crammed in.

Would it be reasonable to ask him to video call his daughter less?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq99mr/feel_like_i_never_see_my_partner_would_it_be/,11,"My (26F) partner (26M) has split custody of his daughter (3F). This is the first time I’ve dated someone with a child, and I’m still learning to navigate it even after 2 years together. I struggle to understand what boundaries are reasonable, so I often don’t ask for any.

He has his daughter every other week + every weekend. So his ex has her every other Mon-Fri. Because of her and our work patterns, we only see each other for about an hour every evening. This includes time where we’re doing chores or cooking. 

When she’s not with us, he’ll video chat with her for a bit because he misses her. This is fine in itself, but as the calls usually last about an hour, we don’t have time together. Recently, he’s done this every single night. Even whilst we’re eating dinner. I just have to sit there in silence.

They definitely don’t need to last an hour, either. Her attention span usually wanes after 15 minutes, and after that it’s just him and his ex gossiping whilst the camera is pointed at his daughter like a trail cam. It upsets me that, most days, he talks more to his ex than he does to me. 

I understand she will always come first, I don’t really care about that as I feel assured and independent enough in myself. But I feel myself losing touch with him and falling out of love. He’ll always apologise after hanging up, be super affectionate for a bit (like trying to make up for it), and then go straight to bed. 

Like I said, I struggle with knowing when I’m overstepping or when I’m setting reasonable boundaries. I don’t know if it’s an issue with him or just an issue with me not being cut out for this kind of life. It’s not like I’m asking him to never call her again. But maybe just having at least one night a week where he doesn’t? Or even moving them to his hour commute home.

the last 2 weeks in particular has been very rough on our relationship. it started as a fight because he said he was spiralling because i went out for halloween with my friends. i offered support but he admitted he didn't know what i could do to make him feel better so i told him i'll give him space (he's always asked for that everytime he was upset). the next day, he starts accusing me of not loving him, that i never cared about him and that i was selfish because i left him ""high and dry"" and betrayed his trust. he then tells me that nobody's ever hurt him the way i did that night. but i literally asked him what he needed from me and he didn't know either and i tried everything that night- support, reassurance, calling him even though he didn’t pick up bc he was out with friends, but none of it was helping to the point that i genuinely didn't know what else to do. i tried explaining that i wasn't trying to ""leave him high and dry"", i just thought that was what he needed as he usually does. anyway 2 weeks later and he still doesn't trust me or that my feelings are genuine. he said that he senses that things have changed, that i've lost feelings for him and that i don't love him anymore even though none of that is true. again, the reassurance doesn't help because he just doesn't believe me. honestly it's just exhausting at this point because idk what else to do and it feels like im losing my mind trying to prove myself to him.

tbh, im keeping myself this busy so i'll feel less lonely since he's not with me anymore. he doesn't have much friends or a lot of things in uni to keep him busy, hence why our relationship seems very different to us. i've explained that to him but it just made things worse. im tired from work and my hectic life and this isn't making things any better for me. he said he wants someone who is obsessed with him and he's not gonna settle for less. this all feels like it came out of nowhere because i thought we were fine this whole time but apparently he wasn't happy. now im stuck wondering if i'm just a terrible girlfriend/person. how can i gain his trust back?

relationships,1gq93o6,"Best friend Situationship doesn't want to commit to me despite how we feel about eachother, but I'm scared to lose him by giving an ultimatum",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq93o6/best_friend_situationship_doesnt_want_to_commit/,1,"throwaway, I need to talk to someone and I can't vent to any of my friends.

So I (24NB) and my best friend (25M)  have had an interesting year. We've known each other for four years and have been very close for about two, and started what began as a casual situationship last last summer. here's the thing; both of us are somewhere on the aromantic/grayromantic spectrum. We never really get crushes and have both had horrible experiences with relationships in the past (not with eachother, obviously). both of us felt smothered and overwhelmed in relationships, causing us to run and unintentionally hurt the people we were seeing.

It's worth its own post honestly, but I really struggle to allow myself to be loved, and it's made me kind of swear off relationships. He's similar. We both HATE dating culture, meeting people specifically for the purpose of dating, it makes me sick. I felt this way long before I met him, and he did too. So the little crush I had on him, that started about two years ago, was supposed to be just a fun little way for me to feel normal, due to some unrelated but serious family health issues I was experiencing. It was just for me, not really to be acted on. But last year he started reciprocating, just physically at first. But it kind of started growing into something more. We were very very close and we both knew how scared we were of relationships, so we loved that we could be together in an intimate but unlabeled way.

Until it started to break my heart seeing him still have sex with other people, and I realized I loved him way more than I thought I did. I tried to ignore it for so long because I knew we weren't dating and he didn't owe me exclusivity, but after months of crying and crying and hating myself over it I decided to talk to him about it, this was five months ago.

Long story short, we got into a fight. he was feeling like I was being controlling and became reactive. We were both sobbing and having panic attacks at the thought of losing each other, but he couldn't handle me being ""possessive"" like that, so we decided to stop seeing eachother. He can be very very bad at communicating his feelings (due to his own past trauma) so there was a lot of pent up fear on his part, including a fear of hurting me.

so I tried to move on, and for a few agonizing months we felt like strangers. I tried so, so hard to get over him. I downloaded tinder just to hook up with strangers, but I couldn't even think about sex without feeling agony over losing him. I've never felt so comfortable and safe and loved during sex than I did with him and I was so mad at myself for ruining it.

After a while, about a month and a half ago, we were starting to hang out more again, platonically. Then one night, after we got drunk together, we had a long, long long talk where he admitted that he loves me, more than he's ever loved anyone. It terrified him. He was so mad at himself for how he reacted to me and pushing me away so much. He feels safe and protected by me in a way he never has with anyone and he doesn't think he can live without me.

We were both sobbing and talking about how much we loved each other, really loved each other. He said this felt like real love and I agreed. After all the heartache I'd experienced, it felt like a fairytale to learn how he truly felt. I was still hesitant and scared and he knew that, he was too. We still didn't say anything about a relationship, because I think we were both too scared. But we started calling each other pet names, cuddling, kissing, being so intimate with each other, more than we had before. and it felt so right for both of us.

So, okay. Here's the part I need help with. That has been the status quo for the last month and a half. We loved each other unquestionably. And then.... Yeah, I realized he was still having sex with other people. I mean, I knew that he was all along, he hadnt lied to me about it or anything. But I came face to face with it, and it made me so upset, I just flat out said ""okay, I don't think I'm comfortable with this. At this point, I can't just think of you as an intimate friend, I want to be in a relationship. Even though I'm still scared of that, you make me want to try it.""

We had a long talk, but basically he said he wasn't ready. He was so confused about his own desires. He knew he loved me in a romantic way but he just couldn't commit himself to me comfortably. It hurt so much to hear that. He said it didn't bother him if I had sex with other people too, but I don't even want anyone else. He's enough for me. And I wish I was enough for him too.

I said I'd rather be with him and be hurt from him being with other people than not be with him at all, so we agreed to move forward with caution, and to be completely honest with each other.

So, today I brought it up with him again, because he had been flirting with a mutual friend in front of me, the day after after we even had that conversation. He was very sweet and apologetic in saying he'd not let it happen in front of me again. But when I told him I don't think I'm comfortable continuing having sex with him if he's having sex with other people in general, he said that request made him uncomfortable, like I was controlling his actions. He said he wouldn't feel comfortable agreeing to something like that.

We were speaking calmly and rationally, with this mutual sadness and understanding, our love still prevelant. Neither of us can lose each other. but he can't feel comfortable with agreeing to my needs, and I can't feel comfortable agreeing to his need to be with other people, even though he admits it's not as fun as it is with me. He says it's more the principle that's upsetting. The idea that I'm controlling him to that extent. I know we're not dating, but I can't help but feel like the nuance of our relationship should allow me to make a request like that. I can't help but feel angry that after everything, he can't commit himself to me. And I feel like a horrible person for feeling that way.

So we agreed to think on it, and that's where I am now. I can't lose him. To get over him I'd have to cut him off completely, and even then, I know myself, I know id still love him for years. But more importantly we're in the same big friend group that plays DnD together, so in order to never see or hear from him again, I'd have to cut off all my friends. I can't do that. I've cut off all my friends like that before and it's caused permanent damage to my psyche, I cant do it again. My social circle is what I live for.

TL;DR: got into a situationship with my best friend and we both fell in love but he doesn't want to commit to me and stop having sex with other people.

Any advice on how I should move forward? Please, I just need anything, any kind of thoughts, even a ""that's rough buddy"". I can't be this vulnerable to anyone but him. I can't imagine anyone will read all of this but if you do, thank you so much. I just needed to get it out somehwere",2024-11-13 09:27:50

And I mentioned this because he literally hasn’t not brought up any plans or asked me anything about what I wanted to do for my birthday, then he says “oh this saturday I have something planned for you don’t worry about it” so fast forward to Saturday and we were doing something in the morning and I asked him “so what are we doing after this?” and he said that he had a lot of homework left to do so he’s gonna do that, I was like wait what? He told me that he literally had a whole day planned for me for my birthday today? And when I confronted him about this he basically told me “Oh I thought you meant next saturday not this saturday” meanwhile my family (He also knew this) was celebrating my birthday that weekend, so on saturday I was obviously very disappointed and I felt very gaslit honestly, Like how are you gonna say you planned something and then the day of say oh I thought it was the next saturday? Like what? Then today the actual day of my birthday comes and he just has only texted me “good morning” at 3pm and then told me that he was going to be in class for his school. Am I overreacting or overthinking for feeling like he just doesn’t give a shit? Like His birthday was last month and I got him a customized cake, and some little presents that he did like.

relationships,1gp4s1d,UPDATE: My (26M) girlfriend (26F) gave me an ultimatum regarding a group trip,522,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp4s1d/update_my_26m_girlfriend_26f_gave_me_an_ultimatum/,38,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/og1YFgF3sf

I (26M) wanted to give an update on the situation with my girlfriend (26F) and her ultimatum.

First off, thank you to everyone who commented and reached out. I really appreciated the feedback. It gave me a lot to consider.

I didn’t get a chance to reply to comments, so I’ll address those questions in this update as well.

A lot of people asked how my GF and I even got together. We knew of each other back in high school, but we didn’t move in the same circles. We actually ended up going to the same college and bumped into each other at a party.

So I think that’s where our initial connection began. We were in this big college pond, and having a familiar face from back home made adjusting easier. We didn’t start dating until later, though.

Things felt more like a mutual respect back then. It was after we got together that it was almost like this overnight, complete intolerance.

I was also asked why she considered my friend Violet (28F) a pick-me girl. I honestly don’t know. The definition as I know it doesn’t fit Violet, imo. When I ask my GF, she only says that a woman knows another woman. She won’t elaborate. She never pinpoints specifics.

My GF was known to have a bit of a mean girl side back in high school, tbh. We discussed this before we started dating, and she seemed to work through that in college. But now it feels like that side very much shows whenever it comes to my interests or with anything involving Violet.

In regard to the ultimatum, I went back and forth on what I should do and what I wanted for me individually and for my relationship. I decided to still go on the group trip.

I do believe compromise is part of a relationship, but this ultimatum isn’t that. It’s an attempt to bulldoze in order to have control instead of working together.

I had to ask myself if I did go along with this ultimatum, then what will it lead to? What stops other ultimatums against my interests or whenever she sees fit?

I still wanted to give another shot at working things out, so I had that talk with my GF and let her know of my intentions of going on the trip.

I told her that I understood her feelings and that she does matter to me, but I felt that this ultimatum wasn’t healthy going forward for anyone involved. I again invited her to come on the trip, with her either staying with us at the AirBNB or her and I staying at a hotel, and I thought the trip could be good for us. That was a no-go.

There wasn’t any compromise she was willing to accept. She was still firm on the ultimatum and said she made her position clear, and if I was still going on the trip, then there was nothing more to discuss.

She kept repeating on and off that she hopes choosing Violet was worth it. I told her it had nothing to do with Violet and that she was the one making an entire group trip about Violet. The discourse wasn’t anything productive.

I asked her if she would please reconsider the situation. She said there was nothing to reconsider and that the choice is in my hands. I asked if we could talk again after the con to see how we were feeling, and her exact words were, the only conversation I’ll be having is with the walls because she won’t be in our place anymore when I get back.

Ever since then, she’s barely said a word to me, and my texts are left on read. So, I guess I’m unofficially being given the silent treatment.

I don’t understand why it has to be this way. We should be able to communicate. I don’t feel equally supported, seen, or appreciated in this relationship anymore.

It’s a mess, but a lot of the feedback I received on here and the recent argument has been a wake-up call, and there has to be some kind of change.

I do think the trip would be a nice refresher, and it’s my intent to still go. I don’t believe I’ll be any better off not going, tbh.

Thank you to everyone again.

Or neither?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq7mh1/am_i_25m_sensitive_or_is_my_partner_20f/,9,"For context, we have been seeing each other for approximately four months. We have very strong feelings for each other and we see a future together. We’re very compatible in many ways, but there’s been this one recurring issue that we’re working through.

There have been several instances where she will say something that unintentionally hurts my feelings. We have great communication, and I tell her when I feel that way. But I am wondering if I am being too sensitive and she is getting extremely upset and down on herself that she keeps saying these things.

I explained to her that we’re getting to know each other and discovering which “buttons” not to press and the only way to learn about them is to accidentally push them. A couple examples:

Last night things were getting steamy but she had to leave to finish her paper, planning to come back later. She said, “I hope to god that you’re in the mood when I get back” and I told her that I didn’t want to have that pressure on me because it makes it difficult for me to enjoy it. I then was overthinking it, and placed this pressure on myself to be ready for her when she returns. I then communicated this to her when she got back and made it very clear that she was not pressuring me, but she still felt terrible and cried.

There have been other instances of her talking about her ex and their sexual experiences that I wasn’t thrilled about because I unfortunately get jealous easily, and that wasn’t really a big deal but she just beats herself up over it and gets really emotional.

I feel really bad and am wondering if I am the problem here. She feels bad for making it about her. What do we do?

TL;DR She says things without thinking that bother me, when I communicate that she gets upset and beats herself up for hurting me but also making it about her, and I feel terrible as well.",2024-11-13 07:32:45

Hi guys, I'm in a difficult situation regarding my current partner. We've known each other for
2y, and have been in a relationship for about 1y. I make much more money than her - about 10x more a year (i live in Latin America, so incomes are much more unevenly distributed, and I happen to have been very lucky to have a really high paying job in my country), Because  of this situation I know that further down the road, I'll be the main/possibly sole provider of our home. I've known this since the beginning, and it has never bothered me - we both have different goals professionally, which have led to different wages, and it's all good. The caveat is that my GF is pushing me to move in together, mainly because she is unhappy about having to share an apartment with other people, while I live alone at a very big apartment in one of the best neighborhoods of my city. She wanted us to move to another neighborhood together, so she could pay part of the rent and share our cost of living expenses, while at the same time improving her life by not having to share an apartment with complete strangers, but with someone she loves. I completely understand why she wants this, and I feel bad for possibly denying her of a better standard of living and life than the one she has. At the same time, I feel like this move to another neighborhood would worsen my life (I didn't want to move from where I am), and I feel like is too early for moving in together, specially in this context when she isn't as financially stable as I am.  Part of the reason for this, is that if it doesn't work out well, I won't be able to move out of our new home, because it would bring trouble to her financially, not mentioning the fact that moving in can be judicially recognized as a Marriage in my Country, and she could ask for a Pension or money after we part ways (we never know). Anyways, am I being overly cautious and insensitive?

Edit: I could pay the rent by myself for both of us, but she insists on paying part of it, that's why we would have to move to another neighborhood - because she could pay a larger share of the rent if it was on a cheaper neighborhood. I think it's good that she wants to help and lift her own weight, but at the same time it's troubling that she can't accept that I can provide better housing for both of us just for the sake of ""making things fair for both of us""

TL;DR: Is it OK to feel insecure about moving in with someone who makes way less money than you, and feel afraid of the possibility that things don't turn out well, but you'll have to keep the relationship because the other part is not as financial independent as you are?",2024-11-12 10:58:14

First of all, we didn't have sex for about a month or 2. We were both busy with work and when we got home, we're too tired. He likes to play his video games and I head to bed early. We both don't initiate sex. I assumed he was just as tired as I was. But something changed after he went on a 2 day trip with family. He said he went to  few parties with his cousins ( I saw pics there were alot of girls with him and his cousins). The night after he came home, he was telling me stories etc. Then not an hour later, he was calling me to bed to lay down with him (which is a signal for a good time, lol) and we did. He came in 5 minutes after I played with him. Which was a first for me. And then came again after 10 min of sex. 
  So I'm wondering, is it possible he saw few women that really attracted him and made him hard? Then came back home to me only to release the tension? Cause we haven't had sex in 2 months, then all of a sudden reminisce about a vacation and wants me all of a sudden. And cums sooo quickly (which is a first. Btw we've been dating for 2 yrs. Now) I'm sure he didn't cheat on me. He's a shy dude. 
  A part of me feels betrayed though. I know if I bring it up, he's not gonna be honest about it lol. So I'm here asking for helpful insights and maybe similar experiences? 
Thanks!

I have been dating this guy for 8 months. In the beginning of our relationship, he told me he has a girl best friend (24F) that is attractive and that when I meet her I shouldn’t be jelaous. I assured him it won’t happen as I am not a jelaous person. 

He used to mention how he likes her femininity as she gets her nails and hair done regularly. I told him I have no money to do that, as I have other stuff I would like to spend my money on. 
He always told me how she is intelligent and attractive. I already expressed my concerns that he gives more compliments to her than to me. He apologised and didn’t mention her for a while, but they hung out regularly and I wasn’t invited. 

I added her to instagram and went through her higlights. I found out they went to his holiday home last year (before we were together) and they swam in the river and rowed in a boat. I didn’t say anything about my findings. He told me himself that there were at his holiday home last year to bring back the wallet he had forgot. However, didn’t mention anything about swimming. He even took photos of her in a bikini she posted (I recognized the location and the tip of paddle of his kayak). The photos were posted on instastory during 3 days.


What is really bothering me is that he practically lied to me (maybe not because she could post photos from the same day on different ones). Also, I feel inferior to her because “she is feminine” and I am not. 

In addition, two days ago I had a really bad time outside as I basically almost passed out twice on the street. I told him as soon as it happened, and yesterday I told him that I was so scared. He got pissed and said “okay how many times are you gonna mention you got dizzy?” And I was like “wtf is wrong with you” as he always mentions that his best friend is in a toxic relationship with her bf and I already heard it on a dozen of other occations (including yesterday). 

I think that girl is using my bf as an ego boost because she always talks to him how her relationship is toxic and asks him for advice. For some reason, I think she is the reason for my bf’s ego boost as she is attractive. I do not want my bf to jump around her, I don’t need him to jump around me neither.
But, if he is gonna jump around another woman, it should be me, and only me.  

TLDR: I feel like my bf is attracted to his best friend because she could come to him with the same problem and he can listen to her all the time. I mention that I was sick twice and he gets fed up with me. He also always mentions positive things about her, but fails to give me a compliment. ",2024-11-12 16:10:57

Anyways, my fiance and I had some ideas for activities that we were going to suggest to BILs/SILs, pending everyone's schedule and interest. We booked tickets for a museum expo that was free (first sunday of the month) and tentatively looked at some restaurants. We're pretty easy going though and now that his brothers are quite late risers / so we didn't go in with anything too concrete.

Anyhow, we had a nice weekend, but I noticed that his BILs insisted on spending a decent portion of the weekend updating their parents on what we were up to. I was happy to jump on a call and say hi to them - we'd obviously told them we were going to be visiting his brothers - but I thought we'd only call once (maybe twice). I didn't realize that his brothers wanted to work our plans around when it was convenient for us to talk to their parents. We essentially changed our dinner reservations so that we could come home early, so that we could FT their parents.

My fiance was uncomfortable during this, as he did not see the need to call them so many times, but also when he did voice his opinion, his BILs and SILs all taunted him for not wanting to call.

It left me feeling quite uncomfortable. His parents asked for a pretty detailed, hour by hour account of what we got up to every day (we ended up calling them twice the first day and once the 2nd). I almost felt like we 'weren't allowed' to spend time with his BILs and SILs without his parents also in attendance, as they asked to be skyped in frequently. At no time did the parents say ""by all means go enjoy yourselves and we'll talk later""

This isn't the first instance of things happening which have left me questionning how much autonomy my fiance has.

I want to bring this up to my fiance as I'm worried about what this level of family involvement means for our future marriage. 

TL;DR I'm concerned about my fiance's family seemingly lack of care for when my fiance objects to things, and the seeming lack of privacy/boundaries in place

Should I be concerned? How should I go about handling this with my fiance? He's not the best at articulating his feelings so sometimes we don't full understand each other. What should I look out for that would be concerning behavior?",2024-11-13 01:45:18
relationships,1gq5bxd,I (24M) feel awful about not keeping up with my girlfriend's (22F) dating expectations.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq5bxd/i_24m_feel_awful_about_not_keeping_up_with_my/,2,"I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years now, and we get along great. We are very affectionate with each other, compatible, talk/text through the day, call a few times a week, and now that she's living in my city, I'm able to sleep over at her place once a week. I always pay for our food and like surprising her with gifts occasionally whether its something she needs, or flowers. I have never once raised my voice or expressed anger at her. Despite this though, she has (justifiably) expressed that she doesn't feel I put enough effort in.

For a year we were somewhat long distance, a 2 hour bus ride. She has very strict parents who track her location so she could never visit me (she was also still studying so I wanted to make it convenient for her) so I visited her once a month during that time for a year for about 4 days each time, and she expressed heavy disappointment later on that I didn't come see her more. This was a bit of a shock to me upon hearing, since I felt as if I was personally putting in effort to come see her, but I understood her grievance of it not being enough.

It's also worth noting that she has very strict parents. I'm always the one to go see her, since her parents track her location and have access to some other facets of her life meaning she can never come stay at my place.

This brings me to the main issue: I am an extreme introvert. I prefer spending my time on some hobbies like programming, music, and the gym; I just don't particularly enjoy going out that often, and do it to catch up with friends. Going outside to do things is a difficult task for me that I need to mentally prepare for.

This reflects in my relationship as well. My girlfriend has recently (And other times before) expressed that she wants to go out and explore the city more, and has also expressed a desire to travel. She's in grad school and I'm working, so travelling isn't really on the table yet. I try and meet her in the middle and go out to do things; it's just that we usually end up going to familiar places, and more often than not when I come over we just spend time together at her place either talking, watching something, ordering in food, etc. It sounds mundane but it's all very precious time to me, but she prefers doing more activities and wants variety.

I can't help but feel guilty like I'm just not that person that she wants me to be. She also told me that if you love someone, you should be able to inconvenience yourself for them; which has stuck with me. I feel like a perpetrator that can't give her what she wants, because it's inconvenient for me and just not what I enjoy doing. She talks so much about wanting to explore the city and how she'd love to travel from place to place, but i can't help but feel anxious when those things are mentioned.

This is something I want to talk with her about again, but I'm not sure how to approach this topic with her.

TL;DR Girlfriend wants to go out and explore more; someone wants to travel very often and likes variety. I'm very much someone who likes routine and familiarity, and struggles with anxiety when going out. Is there a way to compromise and meet both of our needs sustainably without this becoming a huge incompatibility leading to resentment on either end?",2024-11-13 05:00:55
relationships,1gpokvw,In-laws and dietary restrictions,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpokvw/inlaws_and_dietary_restrictions/,32,"My (28M) husband and I (26F) have been married a little under a year. We've been together since college. I grew up in a pescetarian household, and have maintained those eating habits for myself as an adult. My husband was brought up eating meat, but told me he's always had qualms about it himself, and 'tested out' being vegetarian for some time when we was a young adult. Even though he was not a pescetarian when he and I started dating (at 20) he is now fully pescetarian (and even stronger in his conviction than me!). It's been 5 or so years that he is fully pescetarian.

His family (extended and immediate) knows this, and we've spent many family meals/holidays together. What irks me is that every time we are at his parents, they still offer him meat, and act surprised when he doesn't have any. He's explained to them ""I don't eat meat anymore"" multiple times, but it keeps re-occuring. His parents are very young so I doubt this is a memory issue. It feels like they are trying to undermine his choice, and they seem to hold this against me, despite the fact that I never forced/force him to do this!

His mother will often makes comment ""oh so you *really* don't eat any meat anymore."" His parents have no issues accomodating their nieces / nephews who are severely picky eaters, but they routinely don't prepare anything pescetarian (so we end up eating what we've brought if we've brought a side or dish) and then his parents will say ""Oh we're sorry, we didn't realize you wouldn't eat any of the food!""

Maybe I'm in my head a bit about it but it feels intentional. I don't mind bringing our own food when we go, but everyone obviously takes from what we bring, and we end up almost no options.

TL;DR: Husband's family seems to purposefully make comments to undermine his decision to not eat meat.

Any insights? Should we keep bringing our own food? Have a conversation with them about this?",2024-11-12 16:23:36

Me (F20) and he (M21) Although I initially rejected him multiple times, he never gave up and eventually won me over. He has a kind heart, is passionate, and works hard, but he struggles with financial stability. He earns an average salary and lives with his family, who are in big debt. He himself is in big debt.

They often have difficulty making ends meet, and he bears the burden of their expenses such as rent, food and all of the other bills. I am scared that he will not be able to take care of a family he creates when he has to take care of the family that created him, he got no choice and his life is super complicated.

While he loves and cares for me deeply, I feel uncertain about our future. As we approach the age when marriage becomes a consideration, I worry that his financial situation may hinder our plans for a family. I love him wholeheartedly, but l'm concerned about whether it's realistic to continue in this relationship, especially knowing my parents wouldn't accept him.

In the beginning me and my husband did not have a car,  and I was very weak and had a number of procedures. I asked my sister (39f) and her husband for help with getting me to and from the hospital which they did. Yes, they did help a lot over a few months and I really appreciated it and was very thankful. They never showed any sign of it being annoying, even though I was aware it must be. I thanked them all the time and brought them gifts to say thank you and offered money to which they declined. They are the only family I have near me, as we moved to this area away from family and friends when I was 21. I have only 1 friend down here and she doesn't drive. I had literally no one to help me and with 3 children, I couldn't afford taxis and wouldn't have coped on public transport. Some days I couldn't walk or brush my own hair. That's how weak I was. 

I now find out that my sister has been saying I'm a slob and slagging me off for having to take and pick me up from the hospital. I have had kidney disease all my life so I have struggled  with fatigue, but I am not a slob.

It was our brother (31m) that told me. We have a very toxic mother and he finally expressed that he feels our sister is the same as she never has anything nice to say about anyone. Me and my brother are no contact with our mum.

I have always known in my heart that my sister slags me off because that's what she does as soon as someone's not in the room.

Now that I know one thing that's been said, I am shocked. I just find her extremely fake and don't know where to go from here. I can't cut her off because I want to be in my niece and nephews life and I don't feel I can confront her without it being a massive drama and her denying it or cutting us all off. 

Is it best to just carry on as normal? Maybe I'm in the wrong for asking for help? But I genuinely thought they didn't mind given the situation and knowing I had no one else. I'm so upset.

Tldr- My sister said I'm a slob and slagged me off for all the times I needed her help getting to and from the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure. I'm so upset and not sure how best to deal with this.",2024-11-13 04:05:48

This girl and I have been in a “talking stage” for going on two months now. We’ve both made it very clear that we are romantically interested in each other, talk all day every single day, flirt, we’ve hung out a little, we’re just taking our time cause we don’t wanna leave any stones unturned before we’re serious.

Maybe that already answers the question; we aren’t technically committed/in a relationship, but it’s been so long now and we’ve bonded so much I feel like these flirting sessions she has are a bit immature. I’ve completely stopped talking to another girl I was interested in, but yet I still have people coming up to me telling me that she’s either talking with multiple people or just flirting.

I can confirm I’m the only guy she is seriously considering, she’s literally showed me all through her phone and who she has blocked and whatever. She has made it a point to tell me I’m the only guy she wants and that I make her happy and treat her right. 

Every time I find myself ready to ask her out and make it official, something like this comes up and I lose trust. I know she’s a flirty girl, and early on I didn’t care too much, but this has been going on a while now and I feel that it’s just disrespectful at this point. 

I’m gonna try to just tell her that I expect the flirting to stop when we’re in a relationship. I’m not gonna flip out at her and get super jealous when she isn’t my girlfriend yet, but she literally has told all her friends that “I’m her man”. We’re at a point where we engage in a lot of physical touch. She’s met my family. She talks to her family about me and that I’m someone serious to her. 

It’s just painful having some of my friends tell me that they see her flirting with other guys when I’m not around. I really don’t wanna deal with that during the actual relationship. I just don’t know what to do if she tries to brush it off or act like it’s not happening.

Tl;dr- the girl I’ve been close to for quite a while now who likes me is rumored to be flirty with other guys, even though we know we intend to be exclusive and she tells me I’m the only one she wants. We aren’t in a relationship yet but we’ve grown very close, and I need to try to have a conversation with her so she knows that this flirting isn’t ok in the long run. Am I normal to feel this way, or am I demanding too much from someone who isn’t my real partner yet? How can I address it without sounding controlling or insecure?",2024-11-12 22:05:21
relationships,1gpzeaa,"I (F27) am struggling with my boyfriend’s (M30) drinking/using habits, how can I move forward?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpzeaa/i_f27_am_struggling_with_my_boyfriends_m30/,16,"Hello! 

Hoping to get some insight with my situation. I (F27) have been struggling with my boyfriend’s (30M) alcohol and drug consumption. When we first started dating, unbeknownst to me, he would black out and go on 2 day benders every weekend, sometimes even Sunday night or a week day. During this time, I did not join him (hence why I didn’t know) because he didn’t feel comfortable bringing me around his friends just yet since we just started dating (totally understand this) so I didn’t get to see the full picture till later on. 

One thing to note is that he had been single for 3 years prior to meeting me. 

I initially witnessed part of it 3 months in, when his cousins/sister would call me to pick him up and bring him home from the bar. I fully got to experience it when I went out with them the first handful of times, him almost getting kicked out on 3 different occasions because he was too drunk/high. It was embarrassing to say the least and things he would say to me during these nights were not so nice. It did get to a point where I had to make it a deal breaker

He did adjust from then on, 1. He himself said that he doesn’t want to get black out drunk anymore and is aware that it’s a problem in himself (he needed a push to take this initiative) 2. Out of safety reasons. If we got attacked while he was intoxicated to that extent, I’d be in danger, this is not an irrational thought as it is highly plausible with the places we go to and the people we know, I was fully aware of this type of friend group prior to us dating, I had been part of that world when I was younger. I did give him some leeway as I know this is a difficult transition to make for anyone. He was doing good for the last 4-5  months, so much that even his friend’s (the ones we go out with) were proud of him not doing blacking out anymore. 

The last two weeks however took a turn for the worse and kicked off with him getting blacked out on a Thursday night after meeting with some of his old highschool friends. There are a few things going on in my boyfriend’s personal life that are causing him lots of pain and stress, this is reasonable to some extent. When he got home that night, he called me and started to berate me, cursing and yelling. I let him say his piece for 5 minutes and hung up, I knew he wasn’t going to remember fully what he said to me so I wanted to remind him of the things he said. All I can say is that it was borderline verbal abuse. He knew for a fact the next morning what he said was break up worthy and we ended up taking a few days break for him and I to reflect as it was a one off. I understand that I am putting myself in this position however I know he has been struggling with this for the past couple of years prior to me, I want to support him through this however not solve his problems. 

To clarify, the drugs come in while he’s drinking, I do partake but not to the extent that he does. He uses blow to survive the night and to continue drinking, well beyond what someone could handle without using. We do use other means but blow is the biggest problem. It does get to a point where no matter how much blow he does, he will still black out. This was the case last weekend. 

For the last month during weekends, he’d even say “I’ll only have a drink or two and not do blow” or he’ll say “I’m not going to drink at all” but he’d go back on his word and get plastered, sure it’s not to the point of blacking out but it’s very close to. It’s also getting to the point where I need to make sure that I’m sober by 2-3 AM to ensure we get home safely and I turn into a DD for him and his friends just incase. Most nights, we don’t get home till 5-6 AM, sometimes even 8-9. 

I brought up what we talked about prior to us taking a break, him stating he would stop with the “bullshit” aka drugs and alcohol and he would prove me wrong. I told him that again, it’s not an issue of him drinking or doing drugs but the extent, he otherwise would never say those things to me or become aggressive. I made it very clear that if he does what he did that Thursday night, Id be leaving him because it’s not my job to essentially rehab him and take the abuse. 

He then retorted that “I didn’t promise that I’d do that and this is who I am, you can take it or leave it.” I then said “YOU said you would prove me wrong. More you do it, the more my perspective of you changes, YOU ARE a man who goes back on your word regardless if you didn’t say you promised, you still said it to me”. And again reminding him his initial statement from the beginning that he doesn’t want to get black out drunk anymore. 

He then said “ I am a man of my word. I don’t judge you for what you do so don’t be a hypocrite”. 

I wish I had said during our conversation that he essentially is lying to me every time, something he absolutely despises, being insinuated or called a liar. 

This is a man who said he would like to have a family, grow old with me, and experience life’s ups and downs. We view the world in a similar light and offer each other different perspectives that we individually wouldn’t think of. We are both successful in our careers and have stable living situations. It makes me sad to think that at one point I was so excited that I had found the one, someone who was willing to better mainly himself. 

And yes, I was looking for a partner who drank and did drugs casually, mostly because that was a part of myself that I suppressed for a long time.  

The fact that he was able to hold out for a few months is what is keeping me hanging on and I have faith in him that he can do it again and commit to it. I really don’t want to leave him because of all the other aspects of our relationship but this is starting to leak into those aspects and him declaring that the hardcore drinking/drugs are part of his “characteristics” is putting a sour taste in my mouth. I personally don’t think that substances are what make a person, it’s the choice. 

I’m getting tired of constantly reminding him that HE is the one who makes these statements of not blacking out/drinking/doing drugs. If he was honest and could take care of himself, I would not say anything otherwise. I can tell that he is getting tired too of my “nagging” (I don’t see this as nagging because again, he is the one saying that he won’t). 

How can I navigate this going forward? Has anyone been committed to this type of situation and had their partner turn out for the better? Or does this seem like a helpless situation and I should cut my losses now? We have been dating for 8-9 months 

Please be brutally honest, right now my judgement for this is quite clouded which is why Im seeking advice. This is not something I want to talk about to people I know in real life as they are unaware of my using. 

TLDR: my boyfriend says he won’t get black out drunk anymore but goes back on his word every time and now states that this is who he is as a person, what should I do? ",2024-11-12 23:57:04

My cousin ""C"" has always been a constant in our lives since she was born, spending most days after school with us and weeks at a time during summer breaks while her parents worked. C moved in with us shortly before her mom died of a terminal illness. Her dad couldn't take care of her because his job required him to be away from home for long periods of time.

My family doesn't like C's dad for various reasons, but we never intentionally let it affect her relationship with him. We actively encouraged her to visit and spend time when he was available. The issue is, C's dad rarely put in the effort. We would be the ones to reach out to him when he was free and encourage C to ask for time with him, but he was always ""busy"". Eventually, C stopped asking and so did we. 

A few months ago, C starts acting odd. She was moody and distant and openly disrespectful. We thought it was just typical teenage hormones and bad influences from school. Turns out, she and her dad had been plotting to move away for the past month and kept it secret from us. They finally broke the news just a few days before the planned move date. We were crushed. My mom took it the hardest. She honored her sister's final wishes and raised C for the last 4 years (and even before then, tbh) like she was her own and now they were up and leaving in just a few days.

It's been months since they packed up and moved away and the pain is still there. The worst is the passive aggressive posts online that paint us out to be the villains that separated C and her dad for so long. (The same dad that would deny weekends with C because he was ""too busy"" and the same C that didn't want to go to her dad's because she'd rather hang out with her friends.) C no longer contacts us and the one time we met in person, she acted like we weren't even there. I have no idea what we've done or what she's been told for her to think this way about us.

I've already unfollowed and blocked both C and her dad, but I hesitate to tell everyone else to do the same. Mom wants to keep a line of contact open with C in case she wants to rebuild a relationship with us. But it hurts to see her heart break whenever there is a new social media post about how much C is enjoying her new life. Is there anything I can do to help them??

Sorry for the longest post. Any advice would be wonderful.

TLDR: My [13 F] cousin kept it a secret for a month that she was moving back in with her dad after living with my family for 4 years. She didn't tell us until the weekend before they moved away. How do I help my family heal from this?",2024-11-13 03:41:39

She has a boyfriend who has been together for 15 years. I started to have feelings for her but I never thought to try something because of her being in a relationship and our friendship.

One day she texted me that she had feelings for me. With this information I replied that I shared the same feelings. After that she told me that she doesn't want to hurt me but she doesn't want to leave her boyfriend. 

I didn't understand why she told me she had feelings for me but, at the same time, she didn't want to end her relationship. I felt really confused and weird.
To clarify her situation, she totally depends on her boyfriend: money, work, house and car. 

So one day, we met in person because I wanted to understand what is going on. After our meeting we spoke about having feelings for each other but I let her know that I didn't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be 100% with me. I asked her if she has ever been in this situation and she replied: ""I do fall in love easily..."" 

Edit: She also added that she told her boyfriend everything. So I asked her what he said about this situation and she replied to me: ""He is confused because he doesn't know if I want to be with him or leave him"". I don't understand what she is doing...

I feel attracted to her but her attitude is turning me off. What should I do?

He never reached out. a week later i meet up with a friend that tells me he ran into my ex which he didn’t know was my ex at the time they never met. they followed each other on instagram and saw i was a mutual. he asked “how do you know her” and my ex said “oh we are coworkers (side note we work together) and that we “parted ways about a week ago” that was news to me. having to find out from my friend was devastating. i simply walked away when i felt disrespected i didn’t intend for us to break up.

Hello everyone. I (23m) and my fiance (22f) have been together for over 8 years now. for the most part i feel like we have a pretty decent relationship, but over the last couple of years it has just felt very distant... we barley do things together, it kinda feels like a chore to do things together for her sometimes cause shes always tired from work. We have for sure had our ups and downs but we love each other very much. Just lately over the last couple months it has felt more distant than normal. shes always making remarks saying i don't ""love her like i used to"" when i wanted to leave a few years back cause i couldnt handle everything that was going on at the time. Which i have gotten over and gotten past at this point. but hearing her say things like that and saying ""oh you wont ever want kids with me"" cause i dont want one RIGHT NOW before we are ""too old"" (i would prefer to own my own home and have a decent living situation before having a kid) it just has really been on my mind and was hoping someone had some advice on things we can possibly do to make it better or just feel better off about the relationship... having doubtful thoughts and really would not like to think that way...",2024-11-12 20:06:03

How do I be a good partner without feeling neglected?",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpm6hy/my_30m_wife_30f_has_developed_chronic_pain/,14,"Throwaway account. I love my wife. We've only been together for 2 years, married this year. For context, she is high-functioning autistic and romance/intimacy come less naturally for her than for me. This was initially a struggle but we learned how to communicate and meet each other in the middle, and have enjoyed a really loving relationship. Right before we got engaged, she started to develop chronic pain in her joints and generalized anxiety disorder. I also have GAD so I know how hard this makes everyday life. I hurt for her, knowing how much she has to deal with while also working (and doing very well at) a very difficult job.

Over the last few months, it feels like she's been disappearing into herself. What started as a once or twice a week thing now happens almost daily: home after work or on the weekend, she spends most of her time playing games on her phone or reading, buried in her hoody. She's not interested in me initiating sex, or even non-sexual physical touch, which I offer much more often than sexual touch. We barely talk. If we do have physical contact she breaks it off as soon as possible. Even if she initiates sexual intimacy she makes it clear that it's going to be quick, so it feels rushed and unenthusiastic.
I try to be a good husband. I read books and forums written by women to get their perspectives, am attentive to her needs, do all the cooking and most of the cleaning, do things around the house without her asking, do little and big things to show my love for her, try to see how I can help make her life easier each week so she can focus on work and manage her conditions. I'm starting to feel lonely and unappreciated and I hate it, because I know she loves me.

I've tried communicating how I feel, but always end up feeling so selfish - how can I want to flirt, hug or kiss, have sex, when she's clearly not feeling well? How can I want any more than she gives, when I know it's hard for her to give at all?

I need advice. How do I be a good husband and friend right now without feeling neglected?

EDIT: tl;dr - my wife is struggling with pain/anxiety, this is affecting our relationship, and I need advice on how to navigate",2024-11-12 14:39:24

i have schizoid personality disorder, a mental health condition that impacts my ability and desire to form close relationships. she does not have this, but understands my symptoms to the best of her abilities. however, she is obsessed with me. i know it’s just because she likes me, but i’m the Only thing she likes. i can’t handle being her only source of joy. she has severe depression, anxiety, and a fear of abandonment. how can i encourage her to be her own person without triggering this abandonment issue?

additionally, we have lots of conflict about her attitude and tone towards me. she is often frustratingly neutral and shuts down when i have to say no to plans, which is extremely irritating and makes me feel like she is upset with me every time i want my own space and time away. when i bring this up, i ask her to please be more gentle and reassuring when i say no. she says i am always criticizing her for her tone, which i guess i am, but why wouldn’t i if my specific request is not being fulfilled??

Uhm I dont really know where to start with this but I want to say I love her. I say this while at the same time wanting to break up with her. We have been together for 3 years now and Idk if I can continoue with it. Am I an asshole?

We are both now seniors in college and have been together since we were sophomores, Everything was smooth for the most part and we have had our ups and downs as all couples do. We even did long distance a few times as I had to move away for internships. 

We got into a really bad argument last week because of the election... I didn't know that she felt that way until she asked me about it once. I am a republican and shes a democrat. She was very upset with me because I voted for trump and wasn't taking her opinions into consideration I suppose. I worry that this is something that could come up further down the line in our relationship which is one of the reasons I want to break up with her. 

  
Also, I am studying computer engineering at university and also getting a minor with it so I am constantly busy. She is majoing in public health so she has nothing but free time. I also seem to have a better relationship with my roommates than she does as I have been spending more time with them than her recently. I really enjoy hanging out with them and doing college guy things like smoking, playing xbox, cards, talking about girls (when shes not around), etc... She has no hobbies. She will come to my house and just lay in my bed and scroll through tiktok for hours. She can't watch a show without already knowing what's going to happen which I also am not a fan of. 

I suppose I worry what's going to happen after college and if its worth trying for. I plan to move out of state for a job and she has told me she doesnt want to leave the city, let alone the state. I told her about a job offer I had in state and she said she wants to move home for a few months after school before she would consider living with me. I guess I just wonder what shes going to do when we have kids and when we graduate? Is she going to get a job or just sit around and do nothing all day? Is she going to take care of the kids If I am the breadwinner or just lay around all day? I suppose that's one of the things I dislike the most about her is that she has no goals in life. There is nothing which makes her want to get out of bed everyday like there is for me. We talked about going to the gym together but now she doesnt even go anymore and its just me going everday. I even offered for her to come 2 days a week which she cannot do. I am noticing myself in better shape and being looked at by more women which I think is part of the reason I watnt to break up with her. IDK im rambling. 

I hate that I want to break up with her but I dont know If I want to be with her anymore. Theres a lot more to it I guess but I am getting tired of typing. Feel free to reach out with any questions or just give me some advice below... I don't know if any of this will even make sense to strangers on reddit but its worth a shot. I just am unsure of what to do.

I 34F have a sister 38F. Since childhood we were never really close. We grew up in different households she went away to private school I was home with my mom. My sister started going through a separation eventually divorced about two years ago since then we’ve talked a lot more. She has a bf 40M she says she really loves him but also says she’s embarrassed of him because he drives an older model car, his apartment is shitty, he doesn’t make the money her ex did, he’s “too rough to meet the family.” Not a day goes by that she doesn’t calls his children names behind his back the r word, fa***ts, ugly, sloppy, embarrassing , she makes fun of his child that is autistic, constantly googling and searching out information through court records about his children’s mothers. Making fun of their hardships.  Says her kids are better than his children they  could never compete with hers.  She’s always referring to herself as the best thing that’s ever happened to him and how grateful he should be she’s even entertaining him because she’s clearly the prize in the relationship.

 The last year of her still being with her husband she had a secret affair with a man from work; she left her kids on Christmas Eve to go be with him. She’s lied  and said she was Christmas shopping. Our parents helped her pay her bills because she was demoted due to her affair (ppl at work reported her) she fought for her pay back, won( they couldn’t prove it.)  My parents helped her pay for rent, foods, anything she called for really and she promised to pay them back when she won her case.  My parents aren’t rich by any means but they won’t let us struggle. They gave her about $4,500 over the 8 months she lost income.  Recently she told me she no intentions of making good on her promise to pay back our parents in her words “they owe her.” 

She treat her children terribly. She makes fun of her 15F daughter for not wanting to wear dresses. She calls her  17M son a weirdo because he’s not out in the street, he comes home after school, does chores, plays his game.  Says he’ll never be anything he’ll just probably live in his father’s basement until he can find “a young dummy to take care of him because he’s useless” She truly disgusts me. I’ve really gotten to know who she truly is in her core. I’ve come to realize I don’t actually like her as person. I wouldn’t speak to her if she wasn’t my sister. I think that makes me kinda fake if I continue the relationship . I’m trying to break my own patterns of cutting ppl off without an explanation but idk if it’s even worth the energy. She thinks she’s perfect. She’ll say I’m jealous of her, because I’m her mind everyone is jealous of her. 


**TL;DR;**: My sister is a shitty person and idk how to end the relationship. 

How do you tell your sister she can’t be in your life because you don’t like her? Do you tell them everything and move on or just stay quiet and move on? ",2024-11-13 00:30:01

Things have been great up until about 2 months ago when I gained consciousness to put it simply. I realized that I am the one putting in all of the effort for dates, communication, intimacy, etc. and it was not necessarily being reciprocated except in bed. About a month ago I finally lost it on him and expressed how upset I was. I told him I didn't feel special, I didn't feel seen, it felt like he didn't care and he was just content with a half assed relationship. He said he didn't realize that I wanted things like flowers, surprises, etc. to which I mentioned my buying flowers for myself on a weekly basis because no one else will. He apologized, said he'd do better, and we basically kissed and made up. Nothing has changed and I don't know how to bring it up again without sounding like a psycho, especially because we just got over a hurdle of my realizing he followed some female ""gym influencer"" accounts as well as some old flings on instagram. He unfollowed them, apoligized, we movevd on. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. (Important mention: I work a full time job, he is still in school, is not working, and doesn't have a car; we also do not live together.)

TL;DR: I’ve been with my boyfriend on and off for four years, but lately, I feel like I’m the one putting in all the effort—from planning dates to keeping the connection alive. I confronted him about this, and he apologized, saying he’d try to do better, but nothing has changed, and I’m unsure how to bring it up again without sounding overbearing. Recently, I also had to address his following certain accounts on Instagram, which he unfollowed, but I’m still left feeling undervalued and uncertain about what to do next.",2024-11-12 15:50:42

He's my first everything (first boyfriend, first kiss, etc..). In the past, many times the topic of sex was brought up. He told me he dated another girl in the past, and had sex with her two times. He actually gave me some heavy details, as where it was, whether they used condoms or not, he told me she was using anticonceptional, etc.. As the insecure girl I was at the time, I used to compare me a lot to this girl. I voiced my insecurities many times to him, including talking about how I was a bit upset I wasn't his first while he was mine (I know, stupid and childish), but we sorted this out and I am now MUCH less insecure about it. Really, I know how immature I was being, but at the time, I really thought that her being his first sex would make her way more important to him than I would ever be. 

Today, we were supposed to have sex for the first time. Well, basically, it didn't work. I was a bit sad about it, because I thought I was the problem, and then he dropped the bomb. He said that he lied to me in the beginning about his virginity, that he never did anything in his life and he was very nervous about it. He apologized, we cried a lot, etc.. but I wasn't feeling relieved that I was ""his first"". I was very upset. That really did hurt me. Many times I showed him vulnerability, during intimacy, and our relationship grew so close that I never thought he felt comfortable dragging this lie out for so long. He had so many opportunities to tell me the truth, and instead, he everytime decided to lie. 

He told me how he was ashamed that at his age he was a virgin and that he thought it was a white lie that would never be brought up again, but then it started to snowball and he didn't know how to undo the lie. 

Although I understand and I forgive him, I am still very hurt and I'm not sure how to go on about it. It might have been a stupid lie if you read this as a viewer, but I feel like he really had many opportunities to tell me instead of just making the lie worse. Many times that I opened myself completely to him, telling him my deepest  feelings on this topic, and he still decided to lie and hurt me more instead of simply telling the truth to somehow relief me.

She definitely does not like it and got really annoyed when that upset me. After a short while I asked her about her annoyance and she said she's sick of walking on egg shells around me and thinks that I freak out and worry about everything too much and she's tired of it. Tbh she's not completely wrong, I have a lot of anxiety but I thought she was a safe person to talk to about it, I didn't realize how annoying I was being and never considered myself someone people have to tip toe around.

Thinking about it some more, I've come to realize just how dependent on her I am. I run all my worries by her looking for advice and her opinion means way more to me than it probably should. I don't really have friends to talk to about these things so she's my go to person. Although I still feel that she was a bit insensitive, I think she has a point that I should stop caring so deeply about her opinion of me.

I guess I kind of have two questions with this. 1. How can I stop caring when my mom disapproves of me? 2. What is a healthy way to deal with my anxiety if I can't talk to her about it?

I love him (in case this sounds like I am over him). He's funny, educated, very intelligent, charismatic. But he's the only person I've ever had this issue with (and it seems to be fairly regular) and since he is quite smart/educated, it leaves me wondering if it's actually me. I'm looking for an outside opinion.

I'll give an example because I think that's the best way to explain what happens:

He had to take a test for something, and due to various life circumstances he wasn't able to study for it at all, and in fact he had missed several classes. In the 15 minute train commute there, he skimmed the text book trying to cram as much as he could.

Today he told me he only got a C+ on the test and he was upset. I was honestly impressed. I think if I had taken that test without studying I would have failed. The following is our conversation:

Me: ""Wow, you got a C+ without even studying""

Him: ""Why would you say that to me when I'm upset?""

Me: ""I just mean that a C+ is actually pretty good considering you weren't able to study...""

Him: ""Just stop. You are kind of sadistic sometimes.""

  
I'm genuinely so confused. I tried to protest and tell him I was actually complimenting him, but he got more annoyed and said that wasn't a compliment at all.

This type of thing happens far too often. Or it will be some very minor thing and he'll accuse me of ""trying to be funny"" (when I'm truly not...I'm just being myself) and that he doesn't think it's funny. Or some minor misunderstanding and he'll accuse me of ""playing games"" (I'm definitely not...and I can't imagine why anyone would). The end result of all these situations is he's irritated with me thinking I have bad intentions, and I'm confused (and then upset because I'm tired of this happening).

  
But because he is quite intelligent, very educated and has a difficult job, I am left wondering if it's actually me.

  
I really would love to have some outside opinions here. If it's not me...how can I help him be able to understand my intentions better?

relationships,1gpv7mv,My bf with undiagnosed ADHD broke up with me but then regretted it and wants me back now but I can't forget the way he broke up with me ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpv7mv/my_bf_with_undiagnosed_adhd_broke_up_with_me_but/,2,"So my (21f) bf (21m) of 2.5 years broke up with me a few days ago, out of nowhere. He was bottling up issues for 2 years and didn't bring them up, despite us constantly talking about open communication. Just last week we'd talked about a future together - getting married, traveling the world, having kids. We even recently booked flights to go to Europe. Then all of a sudden it kinda just came out of nowhere for me. He told me my sense of humour was hurting him and that we argued over little things. He brought this issue up to me earlier saying he felt like a bad bf and I told him I never once thought of him as that. I said I can change the way I joke and I'll be more mindful of it, but he insisted I don't change myself and that's it's cuz he's too sensitive but he'll change that. 

I toned it down afterwards, but there would still be times where a couple days after I said something and it'd get brought up, I'd have to clarify that what I was said was a joke (it'd be something over the top or said in a sarcastic way or while laughing and I thought he'd understand I'm joking). Besides this, and I do agree, I was annoyed a bunch at him throughout our relationship. Our fights would typically be him being so forgetful, not remembering things, not remembering his actions, making plans and then forgetting them, I was left planning all the dates so I started feeling he wasn't putting in the effort and when I told him that he just told me he felt like he wasn't good enough (I never once said that, and instead reassured him each time). I definitely am at fault here too because sometimes I'd just get so frustrated and annoyed that I'd yell sometimes (although he would too at times). 

He told me all this the day he wanted to break up and was unwilling to give us a second chance or for me to rectify my faults. But after we talked all his issues out, turns out more than half of it was miscommunication or misunderstandings and now he regrets his decision so much and wants me back. I do too but I'm just so hurt he'd break up with me and just throw away 2.5 years without even trying to have a talk first, especially after saying it's cuz we weren't doing as good anymore while simultaneously constantly telling me how much he wanted a life with me and booking our flights to Europe. I'm scared now he might do that again. That was the worst pain I've ever felt. He was my best friend in the city, after moving halfway across the country for university. We always shared everything with each other and hearing that he wanted to break up with me and was just lying all those times to me saying how much he wants a future with me and how much I make him happy, just makes me so sad. I wish he'd talked with me before coming out of nowhere with the break up. I feel so guilty because I was hurting him while not even knowing I hurt him yk? I feel so bad and I wish I'd seen earlier how my jokes and comments would hurt him. I feel so bad and I want to make it up to him. But I'm afraid it's too late. 

I called up his sister later because I don't know many people in serious relationships or those that have gone through break ups and we are close enough to have talks like this and she told me a lot of it is him being super self critical due to the way their parents treated them and that they've always been sensitive. She also said she thinks he has ADHD so I looked into it and brought it up to my bf and turns out, he probably has ADHD because he read the symptoms and thinks he has ADHD so he's booked an appointment to get it checked. And most of our fights and arguments were from his undiagnosed and untreated ADHD and that he just amplified whatever I said and read between lines and made up things which ended up hurting him more (I really wish I could've been more patient and helped him through all this):
-  him being so forgetful despite telling or teaching him things a million times
- me feeling like I'm at times taking care of a child
- trouble recalling events that happened
- failure to keep plans and remember important dates
- getting overwhelmed easily
- accidentally falling asleep while talking (this made me really sad and thus frustrated during long distance)
- forgetting to reply to things
- time management
- hiding and ignoring issues until they were unfixable and
- wanting to break up any time we had any fight and immediately regretting it
- not being able to handle his emotions 

I definitely agree that when all these things happened, I would get frustrated cuz like honestly at times I felt like I was having to take care of an adult and that he just wouldn't prioritize changing his bad habits. I regret lashing out at times but I just wish he'd told me earlier. I now see that all this time he actually just had ADHD and it could've all been better probably with medication and that I should've just been more patient with him. I regret so much not being more patient. He's the sweetest guy but sometimes I'd just snap when things kept on repeating and never improving. I feel bad now and I just wanna be here for him. I wish I could go back and change myself or make up for all this now. I also still can't get over how badly he treated me when trying to break up and how he went from 0 to 100 in now wanting me back and remembering all the good moments we've had. 

Has anyone experienced this? How do we both move past how we've been hurt by each other? 

**TL;DR**
My boyfriend of 2.5 years suddenly broke up with me, citing issues like my humor hurting him and our arguments over small things. We had just talked about a future together, and I was blindsided by the breakup. After we talked, we realized many of our problems stemmed from miscommunication and misunderstanding and possibly his undiagnosed ADHD, which explained a lot of his forgetfulness, emotional issues, and impulsiveness.

Any advice?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpokrk/my_m31_girlfriend_f26_has_never_been_in_a/,3,"Hey guys. I'm currently in a 4-5 month relationship with a woman (F|26) who has never been in a relationship before. We dated for a month and a half until we started to make ourselves official. From the start of us dating, I noticed that she was very reserved and didn't typically pick up certain cues like other women I have dated previously. For example, she would usually have a closed body language when sitting and standing right next to me. She would also get nervous when we engage in PDA.

She would also to this day barely openly mention our relationship, what she feels or thinks about it, what I mean to her, or how I make her feel in any shape or form. I met her parents for her mother's birthday and we had a good time. Her mom even told me that she is known for being reserved and I should be a little more patient.

I understand that my main objective is to be patient, understanding, and to take things slow, but what are some tips to help ease any tension, anxieties, insecurities she may have, so she can better emotionally connect with me, become intimate and affectionate (not just sexually), and openly express herself with confidence and self-assurance?

relationships,1gptn5u,FWB with neuroatypical person ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gptn5u/fwb_with_neuroatypical_person/,1,"Hi, I hope to find some sensible advice.

I am(F/35) in a no-strings relationship with someone I used to be friends with(M/36). He is on the spectrum, with ADHD and probably not only. At the same time, he is confident, has experience with women, although most of it was not very good.

This situation appeared suddenly and at first it was very nice, both sexually and emotionally.

The more time we spend together, the more often I see that company overwhelms him, he can then become very rude, sometimes demanding. At first I explained it with his problems, we managed to talk about it, I was optimistic, but the problem comes back like a boomerang. I try to give him space, but sometimes we spend several days together.

I do not expect him to make any declarations, but in a relationship with a neurotypical person I would have broken off the relationship a long time ago after such behavior. On the one hand, he constantly wants contact with me, on the other hand, when he sees me I feel as if he does not enjoy it at all. Sometimes I feel that I am not a person, but a pawn on his board. Currently, I am one of the few people he sees.

Should I interpret this behavior in the same way as in a relationship with a neurotypical person? If not, what can I do to change his behavior towards me? I try to calmly communicate if I don't like something, but I don't see any improvement. I'm tired of explaining his behavior, but I also know that I'm slowly becoming grumpy because of his behavior and it's probably just making things worse.

I don't want to have a serious conversation with him again, I don't want to pressure him, unless I've already made a specific decision.

Here's another question: can this type of relationship go back to friendship again? 

I care about him as a person, I'm afraid that if I break this arrangement, we'll lose contact.

TL;DR I feel like my FWB partner who is on the spectrum doesnt respect me. I dont know if I should explaining it with his problems. If not, what can I do to change his behavior towards me?",2024-11-12 19:49:56

How to communicate the need for romantic attraction?",79,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp0rp5/i_26_am_uncomfortable_with_gf_25_weight_gain_is/,59,"I (M, 26) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (F, 25) for about 4 years now. Overall, we have a lot in common—politically aligned, similar values, and we have a solid friendship. Spending time together is easy, we've had a lot of fun, and we've grown togheter in a lot of ways from graduating college together, moving states together, trips we've taken, I really love who she is as a person, and the memories we've made along the way. However, lately, I’ve been feeling a deep sense of dissatisfaction in the relationship that I believe I can narrow down roughly around the romantic and physical feelings and aspects that I really can't ignore anymore. 

When we first started dating, we weren't particularly sexually compatible, but it was new and I was very attracted and excited to be with her, all while it was pretty relatively easy for us being together, with that I figured to myself that we could take time and work on understanding each other’s needs... and over time, we did actually manage to become more in-tune with each other in that area. Which is good, it gives me belief. But recently, I’ve noticed a growing apathy from my side when it comes to physical attraction, and I suspect it has a lot to do with her weight gain. Since we started dating, she’s gained over 60 pound which has correlated in a pretty balanced way with the switch in her habits I've been witnessing—she’s been eating more deserts, general processed junk (which is fun in moderation, sure) and has stopped going to the gym almost entirely. It is important to note that the attraction used to be through the roof on my end when we first started dating, we intially even bonded on going to the gym, we had bike rides together in our first summer together, too. This change I've seen in her over the years has affected my attraction to her and has brought up internal personal dilemmas in ways that I didn’t anticipate. While I’ve come to love her for who she is, I’m struggling to feel the same physical and romantic spark that I used to. Over the last couple years, I enjoyed the relationship but it was becoming more platonic and I kept/keep looking to the future for a time where she'll put forth the effort she did to attract me in the beginning and I won't have this constatnt feeling of lack. Lately however, I've felt a resentment building up, I hear within myself that ""she secured her stable relationship, she's not in college so there's no ""competition"" anymore, and she knows you are too invested and won't really leave so why would she keep trying in those aspects anymore?"", I know that's not how she conciously feels, but I do feel there is something within her that takes me and our relationship for granted.

We’ve had a few honest conversations about this, and I’ve tried to explain how I’ve been feeling without being an overtly superficial asshole (not directly giving her lifelong bodyimage issues, taking co-responsibility towards making the relationship feel good and attractive). I pointed out that we’ve fallen into a routine where it feels like we’ve stopped making an effort in the relationship—almost like we’ve become too comfortable, like an “old married couple.” I wanted to talk about getting back to the things that made our relationship exciting and fresh, including staying physically active and focusing on our appearances. I got her a gym membership in Jan at the gym I go to so it's easy now if she wants to come workout with me, I've offered at different times but she always rebuffs. I've  had a conversation where we talked about how exercising together was a way to both improve our physical and mental health and that being physical and getting up and moving could reignite some of that physical, romantic energy. However, she hasn’t shown much interest in this idea, and it feels like her priorities around fitness and maintaining her appearance have shifted. Honestly, I’m not optimistic that this will change, and I can’t help but wonder how this might affect us as we get older.

I already know this is shallow and I wanted to be sensible about what it means to have a partner you can rely on in life and be above this, but I can't ignore how much this lack of attraction is affecting me. We still connect emotionally, but I’m worried that the romantic spark will continue to fade if we don’t find a way to address this. I don’t know if I’m just being overly critical or if this is a genuine and valid deal-breaker for me. She has been making comments about marriage and kids, so I'm not sure if this could also be a sign of avoidant attachment (she's highlighted that these unsettled feelings could be that avoidance, I am also aware it's really easy for me to slip and detach into solidtude even when it's detrimental to relationships I value..) She is the most stable relationship I've had, I feel confdident to start a family and raise kids with her, she is so morally principled, we get along really well, my  only real critique is maybe a lack of physical attraction and excitement inthis. So I'm wondering—how do you deal with a lack of attraction due to weight gain in a long-term relationship when the other person might not recognize the full impacts on attraction it is having, or isn’t willing to make the lifestyle changes? Is it possible to overcome these feelings, or am I just avoiding the inevitable?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL;DR:

I’ve been in a 4-year relationship where my girlfriend has gained around 60 pounds, and it’s affecting my physical and romantic attraction to her. We’ve had a conversation about feeling like we’ve become too comfortable and stopped putting in effort, but when I suggested we work out together, she wasn’t interested. I’ve been doing personal shadow work to see if I could dispel some of the societal fatphobia in me (among other things..) but I’m still struggling with this lack of attraction, and I’m unsure if I should accept it as a fact of our relationship or if it’s a valid deal-breaker. How can I deal with this, or should I consider ending things? I recognize the value in the relationship, but I don’t want a roommate as my wife, how do I communicate my feelings without causing her long term mental harm?",2024-11-11 19:28:40

I’m 20 my boyfriend is 23 we have been together for a little over a year now and we live together. 

I don’t know how to explain our relationship but I’ll try my best. I will just tell you about our trip recently while we were on this trip we had an amazing first few days and then it just went down hill from there. We were at our destination when he wanted to fight about him taking the elevator and me taking the stairs. I know stupid so I shut it down and told him I don’t want to talk about it anymore because I didn’t want to fight but then he yelled at me and asked “why do you have to ruin everything all the fucking time?” Okay don’t know why it escalated that far he walked back to the train and I went into the bathroom to cry and he told me what he did was justified. 

Fast forward to a few days later and we were staying with some of his family when I woke up he was gone off the bed so I looked around for my phone didn’t find it and I went upstairs to his family went and talked to them played with the puppies then asked where my boyfriend was they said shower so I knocked on the door and asked if he knew where my phone as gone he said no so I went downstairs and it had fallen in between the bed and the wall I thought that was the end of it nope it wasn’t later at the phone store he asked me if I was worried he has my phone and I said no I just was wondering if you knew where it was and he said well it seemed like it and then proceeded to tell me he was mad at me mind you he cheated on me and I found it on his phone took me two hours he’s in it and very good at it so he knows how to hid things which scares especially after I’ve already found him cheating he has been through my phone multiple times he even has went as far as going to my mom and getting into my Verizon account and has ran some wifi background check on my phone as well and has never found anything. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore this is my life every day and I’m scared to leave not because I think he will hurt me but I feel like he might be a good guy and I’m making a mistake he does pay for everything that makes him a good guy right? He calls me pretty so that makes him a good guy right? TL;DR",2024-11-12 18:16:02

On saturday I invited her to have dinner at a fancy restaurant that we both like(Dinner finished at about 8 PM), and after it she said that if I'll get her an uber from my place to hers the next day she was gonna stay the night at my place. I declined therefore I stayed with her until she took an Uber home.

At around 10:30PM same day I texted her ""good night"", and she seemed(was) very mad because I didn't ask if she got home safely. Now I'll agree, I'm not sure why I didn't do it and I basically told her that ""I forgot"" and if she really wanted to she could've texted me that she got home safely.

Since then we didn't at all the next day(sunday), only I said goodnight at about 11PM, then Monday I said an ""hey"" then On tuesday I told her ""I get that I got u mad, and I understand that you may need some time alone, whenever you'll wanna talk to me, I'm here"". She didn't even open the conversation and she turned of her activity status on instagram. Now, what's going on from here? I mean, I'm assuming that it's over since she doesn't even open my dms. Should call her or just let her eventually get back to me?

Now a bit of info about economics: I'm a full time student and she works a job that pays her almost 2 times the minimum wage of my country. We both live with our families so there goes that.

TLDR: My gf won't open my messages because I got her mad by not checking whether she got home safe or not from an Uber.",2024-11-12 17:47:39
relationships,1gpbaif,Excluded from partner’s high school reunion,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpbaif/excluded_from_partners_high_school_reunion/,56,"My partner (29M) that I’ve (28F) been with for 8 years, since our sophomore year in college. He lives in Los Angeles and I live about an hour away. We both graduated high school in 2014. 

Two weeks ago, we had plans to attend the Dodger parade downtown. As we were en route, we were chatting about plans for the month of November with Thanksgiving coming up. I had forgotten that his old friend from high school invited him to his high school reunion back in April, for sometime this November, until there was an Instagram story posted between a mutual friend who is a former classmate. When he didn’t bring the reunion up in the car, I asked about it and whether it was on his mind. He answered yes, it had been on his mind, and that he was getting ready to tell me that I would not be invited to join him. I asked him why I would not be invited, to which he said that it would be better for his networking experience if I do not attend. I said that was messed up, especially because multiple exes of his from his high school experience and the times where we took a break over the past 8 years, will likely be there. He claimed that he wasn’t sure whether they were going and in this heat of the moment of our exchange, he outright said: “Alright, I’ve made my decision, you are not coming with me”.  Now, reflecting back on it, I definitely got too heated. I was so angry because one of these women actively tried to get him to be with her, confessed her love for him back in 2020. I just feel extremely uneasy about it. From what I know, he had a long term high school girlfriend, a situationship with this other girl who I’ve hung out with myself when they claimed they were only friends, and another girl who used to send him provocative TikToks of herself dancing with other weird things that I won’t report here. 

By the time he said I wouldn’t be inviting me to the reunion, I asked him to turn the car around and for us to go back home. We didn’t make it to the Dodger parade after all. He broke up with me by the time we got back to his house. He said that he doesn’t want to speak to me for 60 days and that I can call only for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Last time we spent a Christmas apart, he went to Disney and Christmas light visits in neighborhoods with the situationship girl and took all these photos I found on his phone. 

As for me, I’ve been doing really well over this past week in focusing on myself. I’ve been lifting everyday, except for my rest days, and nourishing my body with wonderful healthy foods to fuel myself through the activity. There have been a few good cries I’ve had, but overall, I’m telling myself to push thru because I want to take good care of myself through this difficult time. 

I guess what I’m grappling with the most is this sense of betrayal. We’ve been together through so much, and I thought we were moving forward together. I feel disrespected by him shutting me out of the reunion, especially with those past connections in the picture. And now he’s put this “60-day no contact” rule in place, which feels like he’s just cutting me off without a conversation. I’m doing my best to keep strong, to focus on my health and healing, but there’s still a big part of me that wants to reach out to see if he’s softened at all or maybe even wants to work things out. At the same time, I’m scared that doing so would only set me back emotionally.

I’d really appreciate any insights or advice—should I reach out, or is it better to leave him to figure things out on his own while I keep focusing on myself? Is there any chance of this working out, or is it time to start moving on?

Thank you for taking the time. 

TLDR; My boyfriend of 8 years broke up with me when I complained and argued with him during a car ride about his high school reunion that he hadn’t invited me to. He plans to go without me. He has multiple exes from high school, one very long term ex girlfriend, a few women he has slept with, and one situationship from 2020ish. ",2024-11-12 03:16:37

He and his ex (24f) broke up two weeks before we met. He told me they'd blocked each other, but I found out a while ago that they'd refollowed each other, and occasionally messaged. Not a big deal but I asked him to tell me if they talked cos I felt as though he'd been hiding it. 

After that they didn't talk for a year, but she messaged him again last week saying she wanted to go to a big art show he was putting on but she couldn't, and he love reacted her messages and responded saying he was sorry she couldn't go. She messaged again to congratulate him on the art show after it was done. He always responds really kindly, with emojis and hearts, but he is a really nice guy so I don't think it means much. 

My question is: I really, really don't like them talking because I've met her a couple of times before and I get bad vibes from her. I also don't like that he hid they were talking for so long, and I really don't like that they hug every time they see each other. I can barely handle them texting, what am I supposed to do if she starts showing up to his art shows again? I know I'm being insecure but I just have no idea how to handle this.

I (27 male) have a female friend of about 8 years now (for the sake of this post, let’s call her “Jill”). Jill and I were always just friends, until last year when I developed some feelings for her. She would hang out at my apartment with me, cuddle up with me on the couch and watch movies. Turns out, she never had the same feelings and believed we were just “two friends cuddling”.

It hurt and caused a rift in the friendship for a bit, but we made up. She constantly comes over to my apartment on Tuesdays with a group of other guys to play D&D (we’re big nerds). 

Fast Forward: I’m now 5 months in a relationship with a woman that I love very much (24 female). But unfortunately, I in my foolishness never thought to mention to her about Jill coming over, or that I used to have feelings for her. Albeit, the feelings for Jill weren’t that serious, only lasted a few weeks, and we ONLY cuddled, but my girlfriend was hurt that I didn’t tell her beforehand. I believe she’s 100% right to feel that way.

I’ve taken ownership of my mistake, assured her that I never hang out with Jill alone, but now she doesn’t want me to be around her, especially not having her over for D&D nights. Jill is a kind person and a great friend, and what we had back then was just a brief, weird moment in an otherwise 8 years of friendship. I’ve tried to tell my girlfriend that, but it won’t change her mind.

I recognize I started this by not telling my girlfriend about Jill prior to dating. She wants D&D to now be a “guys night” without Jill. If I kick Jill out the D&D group, I’d feel like an asshole to her and my other friends who also wouldn’t get to see her. If I leave the group, I don’t get to be a part of it anymore. And if I continue to hang around Jill, my girlfriend told me that is a dealbreaker for her. Please help me figure out what to do. I was wrong by not telling her, and I’m open to being wrong still. I’ve offered to go to a couple’s counselor with her to have a mediator, but she won’t do it.

relationships,1gppfck,35m dating 40f - Struggling navigating a messy hot/cold relationship,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gppfck/35m_dating_40f_struggling_navigating_a_messy/,15,"I've been dating this wonderful woman for about 2.5 years now, and while overall we are both very happy with our relationship and we deeply in love with each other, literally every month or so since I have known her, she exhibits hot/cold behavior, and totally disengages from the relationship. Every time she gets really stressed she jumps to break up, disengages from the relationship, resulting in my needs being totally neglected and more often than not totally heartbroken and confused. 

As always, despite my own feelings and pain, I do my best to lovingly and peacefully let her go, give her space, go no contact, and as always, about a week or two later she comes back apologetically, realizes she made a big mistake and our relationship resumes, followed by some love bombing (hot) phase, and then a few weeks later the pattern repeats. A true rollercoaster, but I know the love is real no matter what. 

At first I blamed myself, but through therapy, lots of self-work, and open communications with her I realized I did nothing wrong. I've never had commitment issues or anxieties in relationships and I've never dated anyone like this. We've talked about this many, many times but still the pattern repeats. She knows it's her. She knows it's toxic and immature behavior. She knows it comes from a combination of the trauma of being cheated by her husband of 12 years about 6 years ago, and the fact that she is a super busy mom of 3 teenagers who works 2 jobs and barely has time for herself. 

Last month it happened again. I tried to set some firm boundaries with her because I know it would happen again. My boundaries were simple:

1-If you need space, just ask for it, you don't need to end the relationship just because you are busy, and please don't ghost me completely out of the blue. 

2-I'm not doing the back and forth anymore. If you break up with me, understand that I will start dating other women. 

3-If you need me I am here, and understand that if we make love it does not mean we are getting back together. Understand I am fine with staying friends. Understand that if we are friends and go out together socially that we do not pretend we are back together when we are not. 

And so a week went by, by some odd chance I met a woman online, went out on a few dates, and instantly I could tell a relationship with her would be absolutely effortless and amazing. I am truly lucky. 

Then, as I predicted, the ex came back a few weeks later, apologetically, she came over, I gave her some emotional support, we made love (I honestly cannot say not to making love to her because it is always out of this world), and then it feels like she thinks we are back to normal. We've gone on some very nice dates since but still, every time I want to have a serious conversation about how we are not back together it's like it gets derailed and ignored. I don't want to do it over text, nor do I want to do it in front of her kids. 

I don't know what to do and would love some advice. I love my gf to death but it's harder and harder to stay committed to her, and now even though I set a firm boundary with her, I am still seeing this other lady and am technically cheating on her. I would normally feel bad, and truly I do not want to hurt her, but I did set a firm boundary, even though she is in total denial, it does feel like what's best for me is to just keep moving forward, as selfish as that might sound.

I can't keep putting my love life on the line for her. I have needs too. I have told this other woman everything, and she is ridiculously cool and understanding and totally fine with just being casual until I sort things out and move on totally from my ex....but yeah this pattern just won't seem to stop and I am looking for any advice you have to help me move forward.

Lastly, I will say that a few break ups ago I tried blocking her everywhere but I folded after about 2 weeks. I'm just not the type of person to ghost someone, and furthermore, I have a ton of love to give and if it were up to me I'd simply have 2 gf's, but most people are not really capable of that, let alone these 2....and so I am trapped.  This is the messiest relationship I have ever been, torn between the woman I love and this stranger who is rather effortlessly giving me exactly what I need. 

Thanks for reading: 

TLDR: Struggling navigating a messy hot/cold relationship and unsure how to move forward, confused about what feels right and what is actually best for me and everybody.

We’re exclusively dating for 4 months now, over the first few weeks he told me he wants to be in a relationship with me. Then when we had a heart to heart conversation earlier over the phone, he mentioned “You want something more than I cannot give” and he said “I’m just not ready to be in a relationship right now” whilst saying “I really like you a lot and I don’t want to really let you go”

For context he is M29 and I’m F27. A parent of his recently passed away, he says he struggles financially (sometimes) after paying all his bills, he has a full time job, and has his own place. We text/call/update everyday (on days we don’t see each other). I think he’s a nonchalant man too. He’s not on the dating apps or talking to other women (as far as I know).

What should I do in this situation? (Even if its pretty obvious to just let him be and just let go)

TL;DR - Asking for an advice from a man’s perspective and from women who had similar experiences when a man says he’s not ready to be in a relationship, but doesn’t really want to let you go, but is also kinda nonchalant.

she moved in in may 2023. first few months were great. she never asked me to buy anything for her. she never complained about anything. she respected my own personal space. I had tons of free time. I'd sit down to play videogames after work and she wouldn't say anything. she'd actually tap my shoulder and ask me if I wanted anything from the store. things were great.

eventually I had to get a new lease. i had 0 reason to complain or suspect anything when she put her name on it. thats when the problems started.

the furniture we brought from my old apartment was ugly. she wanted to throw them out and get new ones. the plates and forks etc were ugly. she wanted new ones. the walls were ugly. she wanted to paint them. she wanted to copy this thing she saw on a tik tok video where you put led lights in between the wall and the ceiling. we had to do that too. she wanted to completely re-do the shower. she wanted a new microwave. new pots and pans. a sci-fi juice machine thingy. she said my clothes were old and didnt fit me well and that we needed to go shopping (and we'd stop to buy her new clothes too)

before I realized it, i was getting up at 6 am every saturday and sunday, and spending the entire day on my feet, carrying shopping bags full of stuff that wasn't even mine. my expenses kept going up. I tried to have a serious conversation with her, I showed her a screenshot of my credit card balance and told her I couldn't keep up with this. she replied ""if you think about it, thats not really a lot of money. if you compare it to the amount of things that we bought, then its actually very little, because I'm great at finding the best deals and saving money. if any other girl was your GF, you would be spending 10x more."" (Lol) also at this point we were eating out 5 times a week. always exotic food from a different country btw. 

and then somehow things got worse. she wanted vacations abroad. she wanted to go to concerts. by march 2024, there was so much furniture in the living room that I had to squeeze in between two different closets (one for her shoes, another for her regular clothes) every time i wanted to go into the kitchen. she came up with this ""awesome"" idea to move the bed to the living room and then move all the closets and boxes to the bedroom. essentially turning the bedroom into one big storage room. by this point it'd been almost 6 months since the last time I had a chance to sit down and play videogames on my gaming PC. she told me that since I wasn't using it anymore, we could just throw out the desk and put the PC in this new storage room to make room for more stuff. this is when I seriously started considering getting out of the relationship.

  
and then, somehow things got even worse. she wanted a dog. she wanted it for some tik tok trend video. she was desperate and said she NEEDED to do this trend thing. she kept insisting and even called the landlord and convinced him the dog wouldn't damage the apartment. she brought in the dog the next day. she gets angry when i call it ""the dog"" because it's ""demeaning"" since it's our ""dog son"". she doesn't feed the dog dog food. she feeds it people food, of course. we have to buy the ingredients (mostly meat) and carefully prepare them following some tik tok video. preparing meals for the dog takes a long time, and makes a mess. the dog has to be walked 3 times a day. Obviously i ended up with these jobs. every time she has to walk the dog or prepare its food, she says shes feeling dizzy and goes to bed. then complains I made her take pills to not get pregnant which make her sick. what little free time I had left, is gone. and now I have to get up even earlier to walk the dog and prepare its food.

oh and here's the cherry on top. I had a headache, so i looked through some of her stuff trying to find some aspirin. i found this pill with a funny name (sounded like a Tolkien character) so I googled it. it's a powerful anti-psychotic. WHAT. I could not believe it. i confronted her about it and she told me she's not taking it for its anti-psychotic properties, she is taking it because its good for people with insomnia too. no idea if its true or not.

TL;DR I'm losing my mind. I need to get out. I thought about renting a one room apartment and just moving out while she's at work. my belongings fit in a gym bag lmao. but I missed my chance and now my savings are gone. both our names are on the lease, which means that if i stop paying rent, they'll come after me. and, she has a right to live here. I can't kick her out. I talked to my parents and asked them if I could move back in with them for a while. they said they don't have enough space. this is hell. obviously i can't just end it BEFORE I move out, I have no idea how she will react.",2024-11-12 16:15:18
relationships,1gphgk3,The women in my fiancés family hate me. F24 M25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gphgk3/the_women_in_my_fiancés_family_hate_me_f24_m25/,7,"My fiancé & I have been engaged for 2 years. 
I’m just looking for an indicator here. I know that no one can straightforward answer this question without actually knowing me, but I would like some leads. 

About me. I’m in my early 20’s. I have known social anxiety. I’m at the point where I dissociate, so I don’t necessarily feel anxious but it just looks like I’m zoning out sometimes. I’ve always been an introvert, and I’m always friendly. I just hate talking too much or else it’s like everyone’s looking in my direction, and I hate it. I am a bigger listener than I am a talker. I enjoy being around people, I enjoy being entertained, but I don’t enjoy being the entertainer. 

Something that I think played into an early factor was that in the beginning stages of our relationship, I believe I overstayed my welcome due to my fiancé telling me that “it’s alright, they won’t care. I know my parents”. Turns out, they did care. Anyways, that only happened during that one circumstance and never happened again. 

It all started with his mom. There were family gatherings every now and again that I would attend with my fiancé. I would stick close to my fiancé and people I already knew, because of course I’m not the type to go up to someone and introduce myself. I need a power source (someone else) to intervene if it gets awkward. I am always present & always close by in reach during family events, so it’s not like I wander off and go do my own thing. 

Turns out, after these family events, his mom would talk about me to him saying that I came across as “extremely rude” and as if I “looked like I didn’t want to be there”. Meanwhile me on the other end telling my fiancé how much fun I had after the event. Then his aunt also had something to say about me “not looking like I want to be there” at a different family event. Again, one that I had fun at, BUT I also worked an overnight weekend shift and got 1 hour of sleep before that event, which they were aware of. His aunt also sent him a text basically telling him to break up with me. 

They all know that I have social anxiety and other mental health disorders, and being on the quieter side and on the outskirts is just who I am. Of course I have conversations, talk about myself, ask them about themselves, but it takes me *years* to fully open up to someone that I’m not intimate with. I’m not huge on eye contact either because it gets awkward and it feels vulnerable to me, so I glance away often while I’m talking, but I fix my eyes to them when they’re talking and rarely look away because it helps me listen better. 

To note, it’s never the family men saying anything about me. It’s always the women in the family. Every time I ask my fiancé what his dad thinks, what his uncle thinks, etc, he always says that they have no opinion and they seem to be fond of me. It’s just the women. My fiancé says I need to try harder, but when I try harder, no one says anything, and when I have a slip up of a quieter spell, then all the comments come back. I will never be the life of the party and I don’t understand why they don’t accept this. 

A recent event was a few days ago. Fiancés parents invited us and his sister and her husband over for a roast. His parents barely talked to me, but I conversed with his sister quite a bit. I thanked them for the dinner of course, and let the extroverts dominate the conversation. His sisters husband also isn’t much of a talker, like me. So all the family “originals” were hashing it out about random stuff. Later that night, I get home and see a Facebook post from his mom saying what a fun night she had, and then she said “With my faves,” and began to list her husband, her daughter, her husband, my fiancé, and totally didn’t even mention me in the post. 

A few weeks before that, my fiancé bought his first house (I’m not moving in yet because I’m NOT financially stable enough and have medical bills to take care of). My fiancé, his mom & I were talking about it and then his mom turned to me and said “What are YOU doing?” in the tone insinuating why am I not being proactive and moving in with him right now? Or as if he’s taking this big step in his life and I’m not “supporting him”. That night, my fiancé comes to me and said that his mom apologized to him for being “weirdly forward” to me earlier. I told my fiancé that her apologizing to him means nothing to me, and it made no sense why she wouldn’t come to me and apologize. 

Asking them sounds like hell to me. I will cry during any source of confrontation, and find it extremely emotionally taxing to even start a normal conversation, never-mind start a conversation on why I am not liked. I don’t even know how to get these women alone to talk to them about it, how to start it, or how to end it.

I will say if it matters, other girls my age/slightly older love hanging out with me and find me a lot of fun. Other people ask me to hang out more than I ask them to hang out. So it’s not like I don’t have any female friends or female relationships in my life. I have many many good friends that all love my presence and love having me around, and I love having them around. 

His mom also said to me that she also had anxiety and was able to get through it. I texted her about it following up asking her how she was able to get through it as I obviously want to come out of my shell more, and she never responded to that text. Although she is a heavy smoker and alcohol drinker, so that answers my question on how she handled those issues for the most part. 

What I’m mainly confused about is that these women say to him (never to me) that I look like I’m not enjoying anything and look like I don’t want to be here, but I’m always on the other end saying how much fun I had and really enjoyed my time. I’m an active listener so I look at people when they’re talking, and am almost never on my phone unless everyone else is. So I stay present. 

I feel like they expect me to hear of their disapproval in hopes that I become this extroverted menace who dominates every conversation, but it actually makes me want to do the opposite. Sometimes I don’t want to be around them because I feel disrespected that they’re so critical for what seems to me like absolutely no reason. This may be different from their perspective, and they may all totally think that I’m in the wrong, but I have always been polite and that’s what matters to me. It would be a different story if I talked about them behind their backs, gave everyone nasty looks and the like. 

How do I navigate around this issue?

TLDR; I am an extreme introvert. I am always polite, but will never be an entertainer. I will listen more than I talk. My fiancés mom started talking about me saying I’m extremely rude for being so reserved. She knows I have social anxiety. Then his aunt pipes up and tells him to break up with me because I come across as rude and “not looking like she wants to be here” when I actually had lots of fun. His mom excludes me in her Facebook posts when she tags & mentions a small circle that she hung out with and had fun with when I was there. How do I navigate this issue? (Hard to explain a TLDR when there’s other fine lines, sorry!) ",2024-11-12 10:07:03
relationships,1gpnraj,"Should I (F25) ever reach out to half sister I have never met and might not know I exist?
",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpnraj/should_i_f25_ever_reach_out_to_half_sister_i_have/,3,"My parents divorced when I was around 5. Both of them have had other partners since, and my Dad especially had many relationships after the divorce.



Around 2018 or so (I don’t remember exactly when), my dad dated a woman I’ll call Sarah. Sarah had daughter who was around 3, Anna. I only met Sarah a handful of times because the relationship only lasted between a couple of months/a year at most, and I was old enough that I was mostly living my own life. 



Some time after my dad and Sarah split up, my dad tells me that Sarah is pregnant and that he is the father. As far as I remember, she told him this after they split up and that she did not want any contact with him. 



Sarah and Anna moved to Sweden, and the baby Luisa was born around six years ago. My dad has never met or had any kind of contact with Luisa (or, since then, Sarah), at least as far as I am aware. I have no idea what Sarah has told Luisa about her bio dad and half siblings she has never met (I have a younger sister), and don’t know anything about what the family situation for Sarah, Anna and Luisa is like now. 



At some point my dad told me Sarah’s last name, so I was easily able to find her on linkedin, and I am wondering whether it is ok for me to reach out to Sarah/Luisa. 



Here is my thought process regarding it. Luisa might want to know about bio relatives she has, but Sarah only have my dad’s name/contact, and she explicitly cut of contact with him (which I completely respect). Sarah might know my name, but I’m not sure. Basically, if there is ever going to be contact between me and Luisa, I think it probably has to come from me, just for practical reasons.



I’m not saying my childhood was perfectly happy (divorce sucks a lot and my dad had/has a lot of issues), but I grew up loved, knowing who my mum, dad and sister were, and part of a large and close extended family. I don’t know what its like to grow up having never met your dad. Now Luisa might be growing up completely happy without him and her half-sisters, but I feel like in her shoes, I would at least want the chance to find out who these people are. Did anyone here grow up without a father? What would you have wanted in this situation? Should I get in touch?



Btw, I should probably clarify that I won’t get in touch any time soon, given that Luisa is only around 6. But at some point she will be older and maybe more curious about her background, as well as able to understand the situation. 



I don’t have any concrete expectations or goals from reaching out (e.g. money, finding/sharing health info, forming a close relationship). I’d just like to hear from this person once and make sure she knows I’m out there and open to contact, if that’s what she wants.



TL;DR: I have a younger half-sister I have never met, via a brief relationship of my dad’s. My dad and his ex/her mum have no contact. Should I reach out to his ex/my half-sister?",2024-11-12 15:49:03
relationships,1gq0114,My girlfriend tasted weird,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gq0114/my_girlfriend_tasted_weird/,10,"That might sound bad, but please hear me out.

Me (19m), partner (19f). Been together 10 months

I'm autistic. Not hugely, but definitely. I've got a few sensory issues, and one of them is with intimacy. Sometimes I'm genuinely repulsed by the idea of physical contact. This isn't because I don't like it, but because it makes my skin feel absolutely horrible.

Another of these sensory no-nos is taste. Whenever we kiss, I can tell what she's last eaten. And I hate it.

It's not a thought I have by choice, and I don't mean to upset her, therefore don't tell her. But it's in the back of my mind constantly whenever were intimate with eachother, and I don't know if it's something sinister, or just something I gotta put up with.

Can anyone else relate? Should I say something?


Tldr: sometimes kissing my girlfriend makes my sensory issues act up, and I don't know how to respond",2024-11-13 00:26:13
relationships,1gpglth,Should I(21M) leave my girlfriend (21F) while she's self-destructing?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpglth/should_i21m_leave_my_girlfriend_21f_while_shes/,2,"I've known my girlfriend for almost half a decade. We've been dating for two years and are in a long-distance relationship.

She's got an avoidant attachment style (not sure between fearful and dismissive) and I have an anxious attachment.

I was sure I worked on my attachment style before entering the relationship but I guess the dynamic has made my anxious behaviour show up again.

Our relationship was okay when it just started but we had our first real problem a few months ago. She constantly started bailing on me and the relationship started feeling one-sided.

I reached my breaking point when she bailed on an anniversary trip I planned for both of us(I was home at the time).

We got to reconcile and all. She's aware that her behaviour has been affecting the relationship.

And I've seen her actively try to change whenever we've had a problem, but change hasn't been permanent.



After that experience, I've got to see her life go downhill in real time and it has heavily affected our relationship.



I've seen her friendships crumble.

Her family life is in a mess.

Her academics have plummeted. She doesn't believe in herself anymore.

She's had suicidal thoughts, turned to self-isolation and shuts down often. (She's closes off from everyone, not just me.) 

Goes offline for long periods of time, which makes it hard for me cause I can only reach her when she's online.

On a rare occasion, she has opened up about her struggles and has tried to keep me in the loop.



After a couple weeks, she'll tell me she's fine and I assume she's now okay to put effort into the relationship again. 

But things have just gotten worse. 

More ghosting.

More indecisiveness.

More unavailability.



Things have reached an all-time low at this point.

I recently told her that if she continues the ghosting behaviour I'd leave. 

She did it a week later and the next text I received was ""I don't know how I'm going to save the relationship if I can't save myself."" 



I've given her some grace cause she's writing exams and that's probably causing more emotional discomfort cause she's been neglecting her studies too (resorts to sleeping instead of studying).

But it's also been emotionally heavy on me cause I'm far away and I can't do anything to help.



I know I can't fix her. I've let her know that she has issues only she can solve.

I let her know that I'm willing to support her if she decides to change but I can't support someone who isn't there.



It would be ideal for me to just cut the relationship off and ease the pain, but I don't know if leaving someone in such an unstable situation will be a good thing. I also know that I'm going to have to distance myself from her emotionally while she's in this period cause I know she has nothing to give at the moment and I can't expect anything from her. The whole situation has affected me mentally and I've become a lot more anxious cause of it.

I'm someone who practices meditation on a regular basis so I know the dynamic is having an effect on me.

It's all I can think about at the moment.



As things stand, I'm only hearing from her by chance. Once a day at most, and that's through iMessage.

I do plan on distancing myself emotionally, at least, till her exams are done. And I plan on telling her this over a call.

But at the same time, I don't know if things will get better then. There's so much uncertainty.

I've put my all into this relationship and for a while, I've single-handedly kept it afloat.

But I too feel emotionally drained and worry that I'll also cave in if I continue like this.



I need advice. Honest advice. Practical advice. 

From anxious, avoidant and secure people. 

Please let me know what your thoughts are cause I don't know what to do anymore.

relationships,1gphxvm,Are we compatible ?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gphxvm/are_we_compatible/,5,"So we live in a somewhat traditional country when opposite gender interaction is more limited than it is in the western culture. 

However since a very young age I’ve known that I ‘28F’ highly value other gender interaction and lifestyle, I struggle to connect with women sometimes because of my interests and overall direct personality… so men existing in my life feeds my curiosity and need for intellectual growth…so I hope to always have this lifestyle when men add value to my life just as women… I have very strict boundaries with them based on my own values and religion, i would never have a male best friend for example and think it’s platonic… even when men exist in my life they are in certain communities and group settings… 

Anyway, I always struggle with men I date on this particular point, since majority of me in this country seem to not accept this idea. So this new guy I’m interested ‘29M’ in said he has no female friends and does not accept the idea of hanging out with mixed gender groups outside of work.. even if he came with me or we were couples… 

Should things end here ? Should this be a deal breaker ? Does that make us incompatible ?

I am not a fan of the idea of trying to change someone… I do not feel like convincing him to become like me…

the issue is that i'm young and i feel like i'm entering the prime years of my life where i want to get away and meet new people. i have great sex with my girlfriend, but i had only slept with a few women before we got together, and as our relationship goes on the desire to have sex with other girls is just getting stronger and stronger, nowadays every time a pretty girl flirts with me i feel like i'm going to explode. i love my girlfriend and value our relationship but this is my first ever relationship and i really want to explore and have relationships with other women before i settle down. if i had met her when i was in my late twenties then it would have been perfect, but now these pent up feelings keep building up in me and i feel like i'm missing out on the fun that you can have in your twenties.

i really care about my girlfriend and i would never cheat on her, and i think that proposing something like an open relationship would go down badly and probably end the relationship anyway, so my only options here feel like either staying or going. i haven't talked about this with anyone, i feel ashamed about it because i feel like dumping my girlfriend to fuck other chicks is selfish, and if i did do it then i would hurt someone i really care about and i don't want to do that.

i don't know whether this is something other people in long term relationships think about. like would sleeping around now mean that in future relationships i wouldn't feel like this? it's been on my mind for a while and i can see myself regretting my decision no matter what i choose and it's stressing me out a lot. i'm probably just young stupid and horny but i'd appreciate some advice and hearing other people's personal experience with this kind of thing

We're in a very serious and healthy relationship, with a kid on the way in 2 weeks and he's the best father and partner I could ever ask for. Him and his ex broke up 5 years ago. They have a 6 year old daughter together, and she has a son that's 13 whom my ex has raised as his own and has shared custody with, as the son's biological father passed away when he was at a young age.

When my partner and I first started dating he didn't have a relationship with his ex because they ended on bad terms, however they were still co parenting. I was the one who encouraged him to have a positive relationship with her to make him and his kids' lives easier, and essentially ours, once she was ready to have me part of their kids life of course. We were very understanding and patient about when she would be ready for me to meet the kids. It took almost 2 years and I was never pushy or had a sour mouth about that.

Fast forward 2 years later, now we have our own relationship with the kids everything is great, but why does it bother me that they constantly talk every single day? I know it's mainly about the children, but is it necessary for them to communicate this much? I also am aware this is my own doing, as I pushed for them to have this positive relationship with each other, but it just drives me a little crazy. To add to this, it also bothers me that he has to ask her permission for EVERYTHING when it comes to me. I feel like because they have shared split custody and he's the provider and pays all the child support, he should have the upper hand, but this isn't the case.

How can I change my way of viewing this so it doesnt affect me the way it does? Would love to hear some advice.

(btw im 27 and the guy im with is 26 and neither of us have been in a proper relationship before jsyk)

i have been talking to and “dating” this guy i met online for 10 months right now. he lives in another country, so meeting each other will take time to save up, we probably wont meet for like another year or two realistically. 

but despite all of that we really really like each other and can see a future with each other. i feel like im in love with him i think i could be, im just struggling with doubts and insecurities and fears of abandonment that are all making me feel weird and unsure so idk if its just mental illness or if im justified in how i feel.

so around like month 2 of talking he claimed he really liked me and wanted to be exclusive with me and that basically we dont talk or seek out anyone else because we are serious about each other. i met all his really close friends and he met mine. 

then around month 4 we were on the phone and he made a slip up and called me his girlfriend. i said something like “oh gf?” and he was like “yeah i mean do you want to be my gf? …were basically a couple anyways.” and this being the first time i was ever asked out i felt very excited and said yes i’d love to be. so eventually i told my friends about it and my sister that i have a boyfriend but as time was going by i started noticing that he wasnt telling anyone around him that we got together. he never referred to me as his girlfriend and when he had an opportunity to say we were together to his friends he wouldnt mention it at all. so i started questioning like did i make him feel pressured to ask me? does he actually not want to be like that with me yet? did i rush him? 

so like 2 weeks after he asked me out i messaged him and basically asked all of that and told him if he didnt want to be together like that yet then its okay. but then he started being like well you decide and i was like no this is for you to decide because i want to be your girlfriend but i dont want to if youre not ready cause i look at titles and labels as like a claim and its something you refer and tell people about when they ask like i dont want to be your secret girlfriend i want it to be known. and so after calling on the phone and talking about it more and him going back and forth because for whatever reason at the time he was struggling over having to tell his friends. he was like “i could tell them its no problem but idk on the other hand im also thinking maybe its best to wait?” so i called it there and was like okay we just wont be together officially atm we will wait until you feel ready! and i didnt realize how hurt i’d feel over him taking it back until after i got off the phone with him. i just felt like i wasnt enough, not worthy not worth it. but i just hoped with time hed feel ready and itd all be good again.

so time passes and feelings have only gotten stronger and our affection and attention to each other just keeps building, but theres another issue and that is he hasnt told his family about me. he told his sister about me but she lives in another city so they don’t see each other often, but he lives down the street from his parents who he sees often. hed say he was going to tell them about me but then would come back and say he couldnt find a good time to say anything. and this has happened multiple times that i stopped getting my hopes up. the most recent situation was his family all coming over for dinner at his place and he made a plan that hed talk to me on the phone while he cooked and wait for his family to get there and then once they do he will introduce me to them but then once they got there he got all hush hush and was like okay baby ill talk to you later. and i felt disappointed cause i thought finally we were gonna get the ball rolling! ive told everyone in my life except my step family because we arent that close and i find it weird that most of my family and friends know about him and us but its not the same for his family so i dont want to make it more one sided by telling my entire family about him. but he has quietly raised concerns of how his family would think or feel about us being in a international long distance relationship. but then also says he doesnt care what others think he wants to be with me no matter what.

so now we are at month 10 and it still feels like a situationship. i feel like my feelings for him are way ahead of where we actually are and it scares me. i never thought i’d care about titles or labels like if you like each other then who care what you are its what you feel for each other <3 but then actually being in the situation im like oh no…i think i actually do care.. its just reassuring because now, especially with him kind of taking it back a couple months ago, im constantly questioning if he really likes me as much as he says he does or if he really wants to be with me. if people ask he says he has a girl hes talking to or one of his friends that hes close with asked what we actually were and he told them we are exclusive that we dont see or talk to anyone else beside each other. and it makes me sad cause its like i cant help but feel i want a man who likes me so much hes proud to be with me and wants me no matter what. i mean weve talked about kids already and moving in together so its hard for me to do that and then recognize that we arent even together but youre already wanting to talk and envision a house and kids together with me? 

i try to take everything in account that hes a guy its long distance and primarily online for now and im trying to be understanding cause i get it like its hard but then you hear the saying if he wanted to he would and i cant help but think and question like yeah if he did want to be with me..wouldnt he? but hes such a good and sweet guy, i just dont know if my feeling of insecurity is valid or if i need to take a chill pill and just wait it out longer because 10 months isnt really that long and it is all online so idk! 

let me know what you think if you read this, im sorry it was so long and all over the place!

**TL;DR;: me (f27) and the guy (m26) im dating online exclusively through long distance wont officially ask me out or tell his parents about me after 10 months. are my feelings and insecurities justified or should i stfu and keep waiting?*",2024-11-12 13:53:56

I’ve been thinking through this and would love advice on how we can make this work, given the emotional dynamics. Is it fair for me to expect her to let go of some of these things, or should I let it go and move on?

Summary:
I (34M) have been seeing this amazing woman (34F) for about three weeks, primarily through messages and calls, as we’re building up to our second in-person date. We’ve both felt a unique connection and have been intentional in getting to know each other, hoping to build something real. The challenge we’re facing is the presence of her late ex’s memory in her life, which has created some roadblocks for us in fully moving forward. Neither of us wants to end things lightly, as we feel this relationship has real potential. I’m reaching out here to get some outside perspectives on how we could navigate this sensitive situation if we want to make it work.

Her Point of View:
She was in a significant relationship with someone who passed away a few years ago. She’s been in therapy and feels that she’s ready to find love again and “write a new book.” At the same time, she’s honest about not wanting to erase her late ex’s memory; she keeps some pictures of him in her home and on social media and maintains a close relationship with his family, who continue to be supportive. For her, keeping these memories is about honoring someone she lost rather than holding on to an ex. Recently, she’s also considering a tattoo as a tribute to him. She’s worried that removing these memories would feel like erasing an important part of her life, but she also wants her future partner to feel fully loved and secure.

My Point of View:
While I respect her past and her journey, I’ve had experiences in previous relationships where I constantly felt compared to a previous partner, which left some emotional scars. My concern is that seeing visible reminders of her late ex could impact my ability to be fully present and secure in the relationship. I’m aware that she’s holding onto memories of someone who has passed away, but I feel that, in some ways, it overlaps with the way someone might hold onto memories of an ex, which could unintentionally affect a new relationship. While I don’t want her to erase her past, I’d hope for a balance where we could build something fresh without constant reminders of that previous relationship. I’m willing to work through this and explore compromises if it helps us move forward.

Questions:
Can you provide insight into navigating a situation like this, how would you approach it? 

Is there a way to respectfully balance her need to honor her late ex while creating a space where we can fully focus on a future together? 

Any advice on finding common ground or specific suggestions on how we could work through this would be incredibly helpful. Thank you!

relationships,1gpfbeh,My boyfriend is always looking for things I’m doing wrong ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpfbeh/my_boyfriend_is_always_looking_for_things_im/,9,"My (23f) bf (24m) and I have been dating for 4 years. I have never cheated but he has trust issues from a past relationship. Throughout our whole relationship, I feel he is constantly scrutinizing me and looking to catch me lying/hiding things. 

For example, he’ll say things like my breath smells like alcohol (even though I just got home from work) or that I smell “different from normal” and he always looks at me like he thinks I’m lying.

It’s to the point where I constantly feel nervous and that I have to walk on egg shells around him, or even like I have to hide things that don’t mean anything (like in the past he’s questioned why I’m putting on makeup or wearing perfume). It’s getting exhausting, but when I get upset when he says these things, he thinks I’m acting defensive or weird. I told him it bothers me when he does this but he says I’m being sensitive and to “cry about it”. How do I bring this up in a way where he will understand and hopefully stop doing it? 

TLDR: my bf thinks everything I do is suspicious and it’s really getting to me. He questions me a lot, even though I’ve never cheated, but thinks I’m being weird for being upset about it. How do I bring this up to him? ",2024-11-12 07:23:23

relationships,1gpczly,I’m ill and tired.  Deciding if I should work.  He wants me to.  ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpczly/im_ill_and_tired_deciding_if_i_should_work_he/,7,"


I 45f and my partner 60m of 2 years  have a loving relationship, filled with support, adventure and fun.  We hike, camp and fish often.  Sex is often if not daily when together.  We live about 2 hours a part.  Everything is good except I had a long term chronic terminal illness  that usually has a life expectancy of 4 years. I have had it 16 years.  My issue is I am slowing down.  All the activities I mentioned are thought out well and we only do what I can do.  Like camping I used to tent camp only and now we have a camper.  Much less work. Hiking used to be backpacking for days with ease in my like now it’s a  2 hour hike with me sleeping in the car on the way home. The chronic illness has made me tired.  I have been hospitalized 2 times since this relationship started.  ( about 8 times all together with increasing frequency) In January I was in the hospital after prolonged anaphylactic shock and on a EPI drip for 10 days.  I almost didn’t make it.  I was on over 160 mg  a day of steroids for months. Gained 50 pounds and slowing loosing that weight and getting back to myself.  He was supportive in every way I’ve needed him to be. Helping me shower, toilet, etc. I was as weak as a kitten for months.  I have been off work since this hospitalization because my accommodations for work have changed.   My partner is very hard working and revered the fact that I continued to work 50-60 hours a week in a high demand stressful job even when I sick all these years until now. He would like me to go to work again.  He says I need it for my mental health.  I am a go go go person traditionally. When you have a terminal illness you push yourself. Guys…. I am so tired. My body is so tired.  My mind is so tired.  He doesn’t pay my bills and I am independent.  We don’t live together.  I feel like I might lose some respect from him if I don’t go back to work.  He is a pull yourself up by your boot straps person. I was to till there is no straps to pull myself up with anymore. I will qualify for SSDI if I applied.  He sees me do all this stuff in our life but he is gone 75% of the time as he works on the road.So we have a good 2-3 days together and maybe one day has a hike in it or a bike ride. It takes me 2 days to recover from it.  If I go back to work there will be no more fun I can’t. I just don’t have the energy.  He sees I’m struggling and is very patient and kind.  I want to empathize that he isn’t pushing me but when we talk about this transition in my life ( I want his input ) he is very pro working.  He says if working wears me out I can always quit. I am grieving my career as I see it ending.  I love working and always seemed to over work myself.  I feel like for the first time I am listening to my body and it is telling me NO. Looking back I was not living I was going home after work and crashing till I worked the next day.  These were sometimes 23 hour shifts. I work in emergency type settings.  I don’t know I if can bare him seeing me differently if I chose to not work.  I think I could handle work for about 2 months before I would be ill again. Chronic fatigue makes my illness worse.  My specialist have told be they support me working 20-30 hours a week at a remote job.  My social security would pay more and give me access to insurance. What do I do.  I feel like I’m living and enjoying life for the first time in a long time.  

TL;DR.  I 45F my partner 60M of 2 years have a wonderful life.  I am terminally ill and slowing down.  He wants me to work and feel tired.  ",2024-11-12 04:49:53
relationships,1gpfjyr,"19F found messages from 19M boyfriend saying he’s “exhausted” and unsure about our 1-year relationship, admits to lying to make me feel loved—how do I move forward and trust him after this?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpfjyr/19f_found_messages_from_19m_boyfriend_saying_hes/,29,"I (19F) looked on my boyfriends (19M) phone secretly because he is always very protective and secretive of his phone. We have been together for 1 year now, back in February when we were about 4 months into the relationship. And he told his friend that he feels exhausted from the relationship because he feels as if he has to lie about everything to me to make me feel loved, he said that he doesn't know if he actually loves me or not. He used the example of lying to me about missing me when we were apart to make me feel loved. He also said a bunch of things about how he would be happier if he was single. This was all written after we had a really nice date. He also mentioned thinking about another woman when we were doing something intimate. For context, he's a pretty loyal and good guy. He talks down on people who cheat and says he never sees himself to do anything like that, which I fully believe. But I was really shocked to hear everything he said, that he is tired of the relationship because he has to constantly lie about a lot of things. I was pretty broken hearing all this because there was basically nothing I could really do about it, and it was also my fault for snooping on his private messages. It's just odd to me because whenever I tell him that I love him, he always asks me if I really mean it.

I confronted him about this and confessed that I had invaded his privacy, and he said that none of the stuff he said he meant at all. And that it was just his way of processing things, that he often says things that aren't true to what he genuinely feels. I decided to trust him and believe what he said this time.

Recently I looked at his phone again, saw messages back from August which is 8 months into the relationship, and he said that when he's away from me he wants to quote ""get the fck out the relationship"" and is ""icked out by what the relationship is"". He's never brought up any issues with it and everything has been going fine, actually he said all this stuff the day after he met my entire extended family on my fathers side. He also told his friend that he ""threatens"" me by asking if I want a break, and is glad I always say no because if we were to go on a break, he would ""fall out of love really quickly"". This was really weird to me since he always sort of accuses me of that sometimes, that I would get over it really quickly, which is something that I found odd of him to say. I just feel like he's projecting a lot whenever he tell same that he thinks I don't miss him or love him and etc.

I confronted and confessed again, and he said the same things. Said that he doesn't mean any of it, and that its a flight or fight response for him. He said that he's paranoid of the relationship ending and is really pessimistic so he often has thoughts like these. I don't really know what to think....

He told me about his last relationship before and how he felt like he forced himself to stay in it, and I'm wondering if it's the same thing that's happening again.

**TL;DR: I (19F) secretly looked at my boyfriend’s (19M) phone twice because he’s always protective of it. The first time, I found old messages from early in our relationship where he told a friend he felt exhausted by our relationship and wasn’t sure if he actually loved me. He also said he often has to lie to make me feel loved and would feel happier single. He brushed it off as venting, so I decided to trust him.**

**Months later, I checked again and found messages from August where he said he wanted ""out of the relationship,"" was ""icked out,"" and even ""threatens"" to suggest breaks just to test if I’ll say no. I confronted him, and he said he doesn't mean any of it and that it’s just his pessimistic, “fight or flight” response. Now, I’m feeling lost and wondering if he’s forcing himself to stay in the relationship like he did in his last one. Not sure what to do.**

I don't really know how to start this... I've never been in a relationship before, not because I don't want to be in one, but because I've never gone out and tried. I'm in my second year of college, and I've been kinda lonely since I left high school bc I lost contact with most of my friends, so lately, I've been trying to expand my social circle again. Joining school clubs, participating in events, that sort of thing. In the future, I want to start trying to go on dates and stuff. I'm not like HIDEOUS or anything. I'm maybe like a 6 or 7. A bit on the chunky side, but I plan to work on that. I've got a pretty decent job, so that's not really a mark against me... I think that if I really tried, I likely COULD get a girlfriend, even as I am now...   
  
That's where the problem comes in. I'm my own worst enemy here. I've been exposed to so much media where one partner cheats on the other, that I've recently gotten a legitimate fear that I'll be cheated on, and it's genuinely hindering me from ever even attempting to put myself out there. Hell, even writing this now is freaking me the hell out... Any time I even think about trying to go out and meet a girl, I start assuming the worst. And it's not ever the girl's fault, it's just my damn mind sabotaging me. My whole life, all the girls I've ever been friends with have been such sweet people who would never dream about betraying their partners. But that doesn't stop my mind from jumping to the worst possible outcome.

I genuinely don't know who to talk to about this. I feel like I can't even talk to my closest friends about this, and we're basically brothers who talk to each other about everything. I can't talk to my parents about this. I can't afford a therapist or whatever to try and work through this. I can't keep going on like this. I need to get out of this bullshit mentality. I know it's an irrational fear, but it's genuinely hindering me so much. I would appreciate any and all advice that you can give me.

TL;DR Never been in a relationship, would like to be in a relationship, but my fear of being cheated on is scaring me out of trying.",2024-11-11 22:03:55

I feel as though I am the only one providing and putting in effort in our relationship. We live together in my house with her child. Our living arrangement currently consists of me providing for her financially as she does not have a job. She is going to school which required a once a week trip to classes. I also take care a majority of the housework. She has had many excuses from simply being lazy, having extra school work, and having a variety of medical issues preventing an equal distribution of work around the house. Our sex life has also gone downhill over the last few years. I love this woman and her child and would do anything for either of them but I am at my limit. I try to be very understanding of her physical, mental, and emotional needs. However, I feel as though I have taken care of all of her needs while mine take a backseat or maybe are not even considered. The situation has caused me a lot of stress and I feel as though I am taken for granted. I have discussed these issues with her and they seem to get better for awhile before returning to old habits. I do not want to end things but I also do not want to live the rest of my life as her caretaker. Do I stay in the hopes that things will get better or do I leave for greener pastures?

We’ve been hooking up for a year now and I have always wanted to make things official w her but she just wants to stay as friends w benefits.

We never agreed on it just being us 2 only and she has suspected that I hook up with other girls every once in a while. Last weekend I was out with some friends at a party and I hooked up with another girl who I met there. We had some drinks together and she started making out with me . FWB was also there but hanging out with other friends and talking to another guy.

I was annoyed at it but there was nothing I could do and the other girl asked if I wanted to hang out with her in her room (party was at her house). We went up to her room and were talking and making out and long story short I had sex with her.

After the party FWB and I took uber back home and we had sex . I tried to take a shower before it but she insisted that she could not wait and didn’t want to wait for me to shower. As soon as we started she told me she knew I had sex with another girl and said she could smell her on me. She looked kind of annoyed and was aggressive in bed after that.

Ever since the day after my bf’s birthday he’s been acting up. He told me he’s going through things at home with his dad (his dad also took his phone off him) but I feel like it goes deeper than that. At first when his dad took his phone we spoke a few times using a shared google doc and I had been going through some things so I decided to tell him and he didn’t even respond. Then he was studying for exams and after he finished he said he’s going to a different state with his dad and after like 3 days he messaged me saying “how’s it going brother, you awake?” instead of an “I missed you so much” or “sorry for not telling you I made it safely” so I thought maybe he messaged like that because he was next to his dad but he said his dad was still in their room while he was filling up the car so he WILLINGLY spoke to me like that (he’s usually so clingy so that wasn’t normal).

After that he got fined while driving and was messaging me venting (which is 100% okay) but I kept on trying to calm him down saying I love you and he never once said I love you too. Each time he vented from the day after his birthday till now he has ghosted me and not listened to the advice I gave him. He works 4 minutes away from me so I walked to his work and he seemed so out of it. Even in person and on messages he’s so dry to me. I walked all that way to see if he’s okay because we hadn’t been messaging for a couple of days (the time he did message me was behind his dads back after he found where his phone was and the whole google docs thing was done on his laptop). We went to the nearest park and honestly I was so jumpy and happy to see him but he looked like he hated me even though he said “of course I love you” so I said things like I’m here for you, I love you just try to tell me how you’re feeling even if you don’t know WHAT you’re feeling. He insisted that he’s alright and kept on trying to change the subject then he said he has to get back to work. He wanted to hug me but I wasn’t in the mood because of the way he was acting and if I’m being honest, I was angry that he was 4 minutes away from me and couldn’t drive to my house to talk even for 5 minutes even though he said he missed me.

Honestly I don’t know if anyone will agree with me but if your parent takes your phone, you can still find a way to contact your s/o. If he wanted to he would. I felt bad that I didn’t hug him back so instantly I said I’m sorry and I went to hug him and he pushed me and started to walk away. After he stopped I hugged him under his arms and he stood still, not even moving once. I kept on trying to comfort him because I know he’s been having a hard time and he kept on saying “go home” “just go home” multiple times. I guess we left things on a bad note so a day after I went to his work again (honestly I just needed to get water for my iron meds) and he served me so I’m like whatever and he said I’ll tell my workers I’ll be back in a sec (he’s the manager) so he started walking with me and he was super sweet but not really holding my hand properly or matching my energy.

I honestly started crying because I missed him so much and I hated the way he was acting towards me so I hugged him and he said “do you wanna go out with my sister?“ (I’ve never met her before but we message and she’s really kind) and I said “no I just miss you” and he said “oh you miss me?” He kept on saying “I have to go back to work there’s this new girl that I’m training” so he practically ran away while being so adamant on going to train the girl (which is fine because I know work is important and obviously he can’t see me for long). He said “stay in contact” and I said “how when you don’t even reach out” he’s like “idk find a way” basically talking about emailing.

I’m so heartbroken that he’s okay with not speaking to me for weeks straight then when I go to his work twice he seems bothered so I left him alone and he still hasn’t even tried to reach out (even using gmail) so I’m giving him his space. I’m so upset that he’s been treating me like shit, like I don’t have feelings. It’s like that empty feeling when someone is hugging you and saying they love you but they have that cold hearted look in their eyes. He always answers his friends calls and texts and goes out with them but when I ask to go out he says that he can’t because his dad is home. When I’m in danger and call/message him he NEVER picks up it goes straight to voicemail but his friends calls go through:( He won’t communicate and I don’t know what to do.

If he reaches out after he’s had enough space to himself should I reply or completely ghost since I put in so much effort and didn’t get the same back? Should I email AGAIN saying that things are over even though I want to fix things and stay with him but he doesn’t? Which is probably something I won’t do because I don’t wanna be up his ass. It’s like putting in so much energy into someone and they respond dry to you every 8 hours or after many days. We’ve been together for almost 2 years,  I’m always there for him and would wake up at 2am to respond to him if he needed someone but when I need someone he’s too busy and is barely there for me on messages.

Together for 3 years, living together for 2, we both PC game alot and I have no issue with that, we also both work from home on our computers. 90% of the time, he wears a headset with youtube or music playing whether hes working or not, and sometimes I try to talk to him, ask him something either in the same room or the room next to him and every single time I'm met with ""huh?"" ""huh???"" ""what?"" and he still doesn't take his headset off or pause whatevers playing to try and hear me the second time. It is getting increasingly aggravating to repeat myself every single time I speak to him that Ive snapped a few times and said ""take your headset off!"". Sometimes it takes 3 goes for him to hear me. When someone speaks to me and Im wearing one I move it off one ear at the bare minimum so I can hear them.

Ive voiced how frustrating it is a million times and please instead of ""huh"" atleast ask what I said. I could be standing right next to him speaking and he doesnt take it off or pause it and says what. 

I guess Im asking what the heck you do in this situation because I feel like a mother trying to communicate with my teenage son on his xbox or something lol.

Now my self esteem plummeted and I feel truly fugly. ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpcuay/my_boyfriend_m21_told_me_his_mom_called_me_f20/,21,"Recently, my boyfriend went back to his family for a day to celebrate a relative. He came back to my apartment two hours early because he said that his mom pissed him off. He told me that it’s because his mom said something about me that irked him. Naturally, I wanted to know, what it was but he told me it wasn’t important. A week later, over lunch, we were discussing about how differing cultures like to eat and prepare their food. I’m Filipino and we usually eat with our hands and he is Greek, and he does not. Because we were on the topic of differing cultures, he told me that he and his mom don’t agree on things. That’s where he dropped that his mom called me the Greek equivalent to “fucking ugly.” And that kind of ruined me. My boyfriend told me he was so angry at her for saying that to me and doesn’t want to go back to his family because of what his mom said to me. He let me know it’s because his mom’s siblings were very attractive. And they are. Some of them are tall models with fair skin. They have bigger “assets” and so it made me feel that I’m truly in an uneven playing field with beauty. I’m Filipino and I wasn’t really blessed in the chest department. I’ve chubbier cheeks, I’m not heavy by any means but I just have some fat, but the comparisons from POC and conventionally attractiveness hit me. I was touched that he defended me. My boyfriend then told me that he finds me so beautiful and attractive. He reminds me everyday through his whimsical compliments, his draw dropping, and complimenting my outfits. But I can’t help but feel so “fugly”. It’s like all my confidence was broken down by one word. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted. I’m very aware that I can’t change what his mom thinks of me or my body, but I feel like I want to hide away. I don’t even want to show my face or body anymore because I feel so hurt. I know my boyfriend finds me beautiful intimately and often says I’m an 11/10 to him, but I just feel so twisted when he says there are hotter women than me. No, he doesn’t make me feel bad for having more or less of what they have, but I’ve always wanted to feel that I was everything to someone, like the most attractive person. Right now, I’m just viewing what I see through his mom’s eyes. And I honestly just get it. It’s unrealistic I know. Or is it? I don’t know I’m young.  It just shattered me a little more and I feel like he will be peering at other women and wishing he would be dating them. I know it’s probably more of me thing where I need to work on. I want to feel secure in my relationship when he feels that other women are more attractive than me. Sometimes it just feels like lies from him even though he has done nothing to give me that. 

TLDR: my boyfriend told me his mom called me fucking ugly which plummeted my self esteem. He says I’m beautiful and often compliments me, I feel that he lies to me because he says he finds intimately attractive but thinks there are more attractive people out there. How can I feel more secure in my relationship with him? How can I be okay with not being a supermodel? How can I fight the norms with a POC?",2024-11-12 04:41:33

I really enjoy and value the relation we have, knowing that P has a boyfriend of 15 years, which things are not really great at the moment, which led them to open the relationship. I don't have the details and I never asked for them but I can feel that there are many tensions between them. Even if they are open, we see each other discretely at my place, or sometimes he invites me to this place when his boyfriend is out of town.

This was not really my concern until last month, P declared to me that things were really going the wrong way and he was considering breaking up with his boyfriend. Even though I have no invovlment in that decision, I can't help but fear that I may be the cause of it, at the very least by distracting him from his relationship.

I come here to ask you guys for advice as I really don't want to be part of the end of a 15 year old long relationship. What do you think I should do ? Encourage him to try fix things up with his boyfriend by seeing a counselor ? Trying to see him less and put some sort of distance between us two (like stop calling him sweet names...) and treat it like a simple hookup, or end things definitively between us, or just let things happen as I don't have a say in this in the first place.

tl:dr : Reccurent hookup is considering leaving his boyfriend of 15years, what can I do to prevent that ?",2024-11-12 18:09:59
relationships,1gpcmxs,My (18f) boyfriend (19m) makes me feel unwanted sexually ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpcmxs/my_18f_boyfriend_19m_makes_me_feel_unwanted/,13,"
My boyfriend and I have only been dating for four or five months now, every time I look up questions similar to this, the people asking have been in relationships for a good few years before there sex life with their partner started going down the drain. 

My boyfriend watches porn occasionally (as far as I’m aware) and masturbates, but I can strip down completely naked in front of him and not even get a glance let alone intimate time, I’m not really sure what to do anymore. I’ve never had a problem turning someone on before him and it makes me feel like there’s something wrong with my body, or the way I look. 

When he does touch me, he goes in quite quickly, and then five seconds into touching me he stops because his hands hurt (he has something similar to carpal tunnel), and makes no implication that he would want to continue a different way. Lately the only sexual thing we have been doing has been me pleasuring him, while receiving none of my own. Even when he kisses me he kisses me for a very short period of time and then pulls away and acts like nothing happened.

I feel like I’ve done everything I possibly can do about it from trying to spice it up for him to sitting down and talking about how his lack of drive for me makes me feel insecure. 

I’ve talked with him about it two or three times now but afterwards he doesn’t bring it up again, or try to initiate at all, I am the only one ever initiating, i feel like giving up on trying because I’m sick of the constant rejection, but if I don’t then he won’t initiate at all.

TLDR: my boyfriend doesn’t seem very interested in initiating sex with me, any advice? ",2024-11-12 04:29:56
relationships,1gpfbh7,My (24F) boyfriend’s (27M) mom (57F) misunderstood me and is now upset with me,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpfbh7/my_24f_boyfriends_27m_mom_57f_misunderstood_me/,8,"Alright, so the topic that caused this drama is silly so please bear with me as I get to the bottom of explaining this situation for yall.

Kickin it off, my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2.5 years. During this time, I’ve learned that he has some bad habits, primarily around managing household responsibilities. I don’t want to get into too much detail because that can be a whole other post, but do know that I am well aware of this and I have been (unfortunately) feeling like a mother in our relationship. Maybe I am too patient, but I am always trying to help him learn, and remind him of, these basic skills.
He also has ADHD & high functioning autism, which I feel is an important detail to include. 

Ok now onto the topic that caused this drama (lol)….. 

My boyfriend has a habit of sitting on the toilet for an extended period of time, more than your average person after passing a stool. I mean, there have been times where he’s just sat there for 30 minutes, with it in the toilet… just marinating in the smell. 
I get on his ass about this A LOT. 
He plays this Tank game which really grabs his attention and focus, so immensely that he loses any awareness on time. I wish he cared more about recognizing how unhealthy and gross it is for him to do this almost everyday after passing his stools. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that sitting on the toilet may be his getaway from life and is his much enjoyed break. Makes me laugh but maybe eventually he’ll learn the hard way when he gets another hemmy!

Anyways, now that’s shared on Reddit…

Today my boyfriend had been in the toilet and this time was messier than normal. As he’s sitting on the toilet, he calls me on the phone while I’m out running errands. He tells me that he might’ve eaten something that didn’t agree with his stomach and then we just continue to talk about our day, how my midterm went, what he’s done with his parents, etc. 

A few minutes into our call, I hear his mom talking to him through the bathroom door asking if he can help take the dogs outside. Obviously, he’s in the bathroom and is still wiping his mud mess so he asked her to wait. About a minute later, she asks again two times, seemingly urgent, and he responds again with how he’s going to take awhile because it is messy. 

I know my boyfriend started to get irritated and at this point he’s talking a full convo / mild argument with his mom so I am just silent on the phone. I’m thinking… ok she’s impatient but also I understand her frustration because I know he sits in there for a long time. 
(At the time of our call, I do not know how long he has been in the bathroom for and still don’t).

A minute goes by and he’s done and is outside with the dogs. I hang up at this point bc I continue to do my errands. 

I don’t know, maybe 10 minutes later he calls me back and we just continue talking. His mom begins to yell again in the background (i make out absolutely nothing) and I hear my boyfriend go “Gosh, I’m sorry I was pooping. I’m sorry I was pooping okay!” 

I laugh, and say “You’re apologizing for pooping?”, in a laughing manner because hearing him say that was genuinely funny knowing how he is. Bad timing on my part because the tone of him yelling back sounded like actual anger stirred up. I also didn’t know I was on speakerphone. 

His mom heard me say that question and got offended over this. I can see how she may mistake it for attitude. 
She took his phone, and started yelling at me how “I’m disrespectful” and “I shouldn’t talk to parents that way”. 
In the moment, I’m driving, and not understanding what is going on but my name was being used and I was being told I’m disrespectful by her? 
I was so confused and speechless. 

When she stopped yelling, I asked what was going on and that caused her to continue to yell at me and say how I need to “stop talking this way”. 

Simultaneously, my boyfriend is apologizing to me and is saying “now you get to experience first hand what she’s like”. 
I am aware of my boyfriend’s relationship with his mom before this too, they lived together but she also has her handful of flaws too, as we all do. Never once have I argued with my boyfriend’s parents, this was the first time ever she’s yelled at me. 

My boyfriend eventually hung up the phone and calls me back (~15/20 mins later) when he’s about to leave his house to go to the gym. 
We chat and he has absolutely no idea why she blew up on me. He can’t explain logic to his mom either because from previous arguments between him and her, it seems she has a very emotional driven way of thinking (lacking logic, communication, or care to admit a wrongdoing and apologize). 

I want communication! I want to clear up any misunderstanding so I sent this text message (she left me on read): 

“[her name], 
i was on the phone with [my bf] and asked him why he got in trouble for pooping, and i then heard you ask to talk to me. 

you may have misunderstood my question to him so i did not mean to offend or make you upset. 

i am really confused and hope you’re not mad at me over this misunderstanding. 

i do not know what had happened until [my bf] explained his side just now and after hearing you be upset. 

i do agree he takes a long time to wipe after pooping which makes him delay/procrasinate responsibilities. i get on his butt about taking so long too.

moral of my text message, you misheard my question to [my bf] which led you to become upset. 
i apologize for the misunderstanding and did not mean to make you upset as i did not know what was happening and my question was towards [my bf]. 

i want to clear that up with you.“
———

it does make me chuckle that this drama is all started from my mans pooping. looking back in my message, i feel i could’ve worded things better. i should’ve waited when it was less fresh and i wasn’t in a rush to get it sent out. 

Most recently, I was on the phone again with my boyfriend. He suddenly muted and I presume his mom walks in. 
It was true, and she said “I can come over, but only if I am not disrespectful” 

Now I am more frustrated, sad, and anxious. I really don’t want her to feel that way about me when I have never meant to make her feel that way. 

Going back to what I said about his mom and her emotional driven thinking… this kind of behavior I am familiar with, from my sister and dad (love them to pieces). 
It is extremely hard to have a successful conversation with them when clearing up an argument or misunderstanding. They will refuse to admit they were wrong. 

Well, I don’t want to have bad relations with my boyfriend’s parents, so I really want to clear up this misunderstanding with his mom. Knowing how she is when it comes to communication and confrontation, and having dealt with similar behaviors, I am afraid to confront her and clear things up with her. 

I don’t want to risk her getting even more mad when I explain how I feel and what was said, because then that means “she’s in the wrong & therefore her image is tainted”. 
I don’t think she will come to terms with that. It isn’t like I’m talking to my sister or dad, it is my boyfriend’s mom. I never ever have disrespected her, and have no reason to! 

I really don’t want to cause more drama with her, but I also don’t want her to think I disrespected her. It is a huge misunderstanding. 

I have been trying to think of a way to approach her to clear up this misunderstanding without her taking offense. 
How my boyfriend and his dad deal with arguments with her… they just leave it and act like it never happened. But I cannot sit with that especially since I am not family and don’t want her to think poor of me.

I guess the main piece of advice I’m seeking is how I go on about confronting her. Should i even do so? I want an apology from her, normally I don’t care about one, but I want her to recognize she had no reason to yell at me the way she did. 

TLDR: 
My boyfriend’s mother misunderstood a question I had asked my boyfriend as attitude/judgement towards her. She is very angry and isn’t good at communication so I don’t know how to confront her to clear up her misunderstanding. I want to avoid creating more drama. I would just like peace and be on good terms.

A lot of subtle, underhanded moves, pulling the strings behind the scenes, very calculated and advanced narcissistic behavior all with fake smiles for appearances and pretending to ""love"" me. I know this particular type of person and I have been hurt by some of their actions lately, including one of his sisters verbally attacking, projecting and gaslighting me with his brother joining in and tag-teaming me with her and made me cry as well as his mother creating scenes for me to walk into and spiral because they looked suspicious, his father accusing me of having ""trust issues"" (though he did later apologize and hug me). I secretly don't like these people and don't feel the need to spend my time with people who hurt my feelings and made me feel beat up, but they'd ""love to have my family and I over for Thanksgiving"". How can I politely decline without telling the real reason I'd prefer not to be there?

My older sister who’s in her late 20s has been struggling with depression since 5 years and she has been taking antidepressants for two years and the last time she was in CBT was one year ago. I haven’t seen any change in her behavior nor her impulses. However, her symptoms have gotten a bit better but still struggling to move on with her life like forming relationships with people and working on her issues and finding a job. She’s been stagnant for 5 years since she dropped out of college. I’m the closest one out of the family and sometimes she doesn’t talk to me or communicate with me for days for no reason like I have to always confront her and check in on her for her to say something. She just stays locked in the room without talking to any of us for no reason despite our consistent effort to get her out of her bubble and try to satisfy her needs. She has been stressing me out seeing her like that for years without any improvement. What should I do in this situation? And how can I stop her from affecting me emotionally?

relationships,1gpo2m9,My boyfriend loves me but I don’t love him. Does this mean I should break up with him?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpo2m9/my_boyfriend_loves_me_but_i_dont_love_him_does/,12,"My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been in a relationship for 1 year.

This is both our first relationship, so we tried very hard to resolve any conflict we encountered. We kept researching on better ways to resolve conflicts as our conflicts got nastier and more frequent.

Initially, it started out with me being avoidant and refusing to open up whenever I got upset or was hurt by his actions or words. Over time, as I got more open with expressing my feelings, I noticed that there was a lot of things that he did that made me upset. For example, I felt that he would only consider himself as we walked around our college campus, as he would often trip me or walk in a direction that would slowly lead me into walking into a wall. It started off with these small things, which eventually lead to bigger things. 

I dislike how inconsistent he is, his indecisiveness and his lack of proper apology. 

Whenever a conflict arises and I express my feelings regarding the matter, he would jump to his defence, saying how he was impacted by certain things or how he saw what he did differently. I found it upsetting that he wouldn’t try to understand me first, as I would have to remind him that it would’ve been nice if he had tried to understand my perspective first.

During conflicts, we would promise that we would act differently when on occasions that a conflict occurs again. I admit that I’m not perfect, I often find myself avoiding him, but I always try my best to talk about it on the same day after I had some time to myself. However, my boyfriend acts inconsistently. After a conflict, for one week he would be extremely caring, trying his best to make me happy and not repeat the actions that caused the conflict. After a week, he would go back to his usual behaviour, which would lead to another conflict. After a while, I noticed the pattern and got upset at how inconsistent he is.

The most I dislike about him is his indecisiveness. He would take extremely long on deciding anything. I understand it takes time to decide on things, as someone who is also indecisive, which is why I would try my best to give him time to decide. What broke me was 2 occasions. 

Context to the first occasion, I gave him 7 chances to make things right before I’m officially done with him.
He was on 2 remaining chances, I told him he could either talk to me and lose one chance or we don’t talk and he got to keep his chance. He chose to keep his 2nd chance. I admit, I was a little disappointed that he chose to keep a chance rather than talk to me, but I can understand that from his perspective that he rather keep a chance as he doesn’t know when is the next time he’d lose another chance. However, shortly after he reveals he regrets his decision after I had told him that I was considering on keeping his 2 chances if our talk had went well. I felt upset by this as it felt like he only considers what’s best for him.

The second occasion was when I told him that I wanted to trust him to decide where we should eat after class. After 3 hours of school, he asked me where I would like to eat for lunch. This made me upset as it felt like my trust meant nothing to him. He saw that I got visibly upset and immediately decided on a place to eat. Which made me even more upset as I felt like he had already made up his mind prior but decided to not tell me.

Today, I realised how childish and selfish I am. I got upset at him over who he is. It is wrong of me to try to change who he is just for me. So, I decided to speak to him about it. I told him that maybe we weren’t meant to be since I can’t seem to be happy with who he is. I feel so incapable of love but I don’t understand why I’m sad that I told him that we weren’t meant to be despite seeming factual true.

I don’t know anything about love and I don’t know what to do. I feel it would be better if he found someone better than me, but I also know how broken he feels after I told him that we might not be suited for each other.

TL;DR:
My boyfriend and I have been in constant conflict and I realised it is due to me being upset at his characteristics. Which made me realise that I don’t love him for who he is. 

Would it be better if we broke up?

I've never made a post here before or had an account but I listen to the reddit thread stories podcast and this seemed like a good place to ask this question. So me (25 yr old woman) and my gf (24 yr old woman) have been together almost 4 years and are super in love. She's gained a significant amount of weight since we met and I've never said anything nor would I!! I used to be anorexic and I know how that kind of criticism can effect someone.  She's even asked me directly if I had a problem with her weight and said ""you can tell me, it would actually help motivate me to work out"" but obviously I didn't say anything and just supported her. I love her so much and still find her so beautiful--her eyes, her smile, her hair, her lips, there are so many other wonderful things about her--and I tell her how gorgeous she is all the time. I know that she's struggling with the weight stuff herself and I've often asked how I can support her and do whatever I can--I think that's the best I can do. It's been a year or so and she hasn't lost any weight.

But lately I have a problem that I don't know how to address...I think the way her body has changed has affected how much I'm sexually attracted to her. I love her so much and want us to have a good sex life--she absolutely deserves that. We still hook up and I make her come but I'm a little reluctant for sure and I haven't really been wanting her to do stuff to me because while I'm into making her feel good, I personally don't really feel turned on the most...and I know she'll be able to tell. I've just told her that I've been having a low sex drive lately but I don't know if its going to change and eventually we may have top confront it. I don't want to tell her the truth but I never keep anything from her so this is really hard for me... so I feel like I'm really in a bind here. There are so many little lies that go into this where I'm always telling her how hot her body is, how she's beautiful just the way she is when she gets insecure and not to worry, how I'm SO into her body no matter what, I compliment her constantly--I always have and I do with any woman I date because I want her to feel confident and beautiful! And I HATE keeping things from a partner!

Another shitty side-effect is that my anorexic tendencies that used to make me overanalyze my own body are coming out again--but directed at her. I worry about what people think of her or of us together. We have a lot of threesomes and I worry about whether or not our third is judging her. She also compares herself to me a lot and worries that our thirds find me more attractive and i always reassure her but I'm worried about it too tbh and I feel so protective of her in that circumstance. Note that she's not drastically overweight or anything--she's a size large (8/10) and used to be a smaller medium (4) but it's definitely noticeable.  and she has a different type of body from me for sure and has always been bigger than me--it's just triggering those feelings for me and I know how fucked up that is but it's hard to fight those emotions.

Tl;dr Should I say something about my gf's weight gain and how its affected my sex drive? I know I shouldn't but I feel like I'm really getting backed into a corner here because I know she's noticing that my sex drive is a lot lower and I'm more reluctant to hook up. I would never break up with her over this and I strongly doubt she would break up with me if I told her. But she would definitely feel kind of betrayed because I'm so adamant about how beautiful I think her body is and she would know that's not true. Is there anything else I can do?

I am a 30M in a new relationship (met her 3 months ago, exclusive 1 month in, bf/gf 2 months in) with a 32F. I'll start by saying that she is an amazing woman. She's been through so much starting from her early childhood - divorced parents, verbally abusive / controlling mother, abusive romantic relationships, gave up acceptances from amazing universities for family reasons, returned to college and worked on her thesis for years only for the university to revoke it because she worked at a dispensary, shit job after shit job, and the list goes on.

Despite all that, she loves and cares for her family (even the ones that wronged / continue to wrong her), spends more money on other people than herself, is very independent and won't accept help from anyone, is a great listener, accepts other people's shortcomings (including my own), and overall just a great human being.

When things are good, it's good / great, like our dates, hanging out with her friends, our trip to Disneyland, and generally spending time in each other's company. However, when I'm away from her (I live about a 2 hour drive away and I visit her during the weekends), she is frequently in a depressive state (even more so now after quitting her mentally- and physically-taxing job and taking a break from school). She's applying to jobs but no call-backs at all (shit job market doesn't help).

My question to the helpful folks of Reddit: how do I support my gf when we're apart? I feel like the supportive text messages have less and less of an impact. I plan to move within the next 2-3 months, but she has expressed how bad it would make her feel if I moved just for her - my family and friends are all here while the only people I know in her city are her friends and family. I have 0 problem with this, as I am generally a homebody (she is too) and when we go out with her friends or meet new people, I make new friends very easily.

But because of her independent nature (stemming from lack of financial, emotional, and any other help growing up), she has openly and often expressed how she does not deserve me. I have a good income (enough to support both of us), good relationships with friends / family, and have a generally positive outlook on life. All that said, this is a new relationship and it's completely understandable why she is hesitant, so I want to approach my future with her very delicately!

Since at first it was nothing too serious, we would hang out at my house sometimes. Naturally she met my parents, since I live with them.

It was kind of weird because we weren't in a relationship yet, so I introduced her as my date, casually.

Ever since we went official she started the talks about us having dinner with her parents and siblings at her house. She never invited me before because they're pretty strict.

The day we went official she told them immediatly after and recieved mixed responses. Her mother and siblings are eager to meet me but her father is pretty ""jealous"", even though her other sisters are in relationships.

She's the younger one though, so I guess it makes sense in a way, but it scares me a lot.

I talked about this with my therapist, told her I felt it was too sudden, and she recommended to find a middle ground.

The thing is my girlfriend is kind of anxious about the ordeal, in a good way, but still anxious.

I agreed to the possibility of going there and meeting them next weekend and I can already feel my cortisol levels growing by the minute.

relationships,1gpcc2s,How do I get my boyfriend to open up emotionally and trust me?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpcc2s/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriend_to_open_up_emotionally/,2," Me (26F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been dating for eight years since high school and want to get married soon and all the marriage talks seem overwhelming. I’ve always been someone who’s not really good at regulating emotions because of my upbringing, but I am going to therapy now and working on them. Over the years, he has been a great support system, he takes care of me, and I’ve learnt a lot from him.

Like I said, I’m not really good at regulating emotions, there have been some times in the past when he was struggling and tried to reach out to me and I seemed to have made it worse, by not knowing how to handle those situations well. And in recent conversations, he says that at this point in our relationship he feels defeated and I should just know what he wants and needs without him asking for it. Every time I sense that he is upset/stressed or worried, I end up being more stressed and anxious on what should I do? What should I say? I worry if I’m saying the right thing, to not make the situation worse (but somehow always end up saying the wrong thing and making it worse anyway). I guess I start acting like the victim myself when it’s not even about me.  
  
How do I get him to open up? I don’t really know what he goes through, and have no idea how to help him through it either. This past week, he’s been going through something and all he keeps saying is I don’t feel like talking, so we’ve barely been in contact (I’m trying to give him the space he wants, but I feel like he will think I don’t care about him if I actually leave him alone, but I also don’t want to be overbearing and push him away)  
How do I fix the trust that got broken in the past, when I didn’t show up for him?   
  
TLDR: long term relationship, how can I get my boyfriend to open up emotionally without him feeling defeated?  He says I should just know what to do, but he doesnt share enough with me for me to understand the situation. I also start to feel like I'm the victim (I'm working on that).",2024-11-12 04:13:20

They told me that my cousin was busy with all the bureaucracy and stuff after the funeral but 

1) They didn't ask my parents (or me) to go to the funeral. I partly understand that because he wasn't a biological family member, but still hurt. I didn't go because I didn't want them to feel uncomfortable and idk it's just boundaries I guess 😅 Basically couldn't go because they didn't even told us where or when it was. So yeah... I know 😅 Didn't argue or get angry, just sad.

2) I contacted her daughter (17f) and told her that if she needed something that she could talk to me. She replied and that's all, she's been busy with school and didn't want to be annoying. 

I feel this is so cold, like my cousin doesn't want anything to do with us (parents & me). Would it be so wrong to go to her house and bring some food (like cake, biscuits...) or self care products??? Just bring them, have a small talk and leave. 

I talked to him while he was alive, he was nice and funny. I don't know why I couldn't go to his funeral and say goodbye (I didn't want to argue with them at that time but it still hurts tbh). There's no malice or bad intentions, just want to be with her but it seems that she is grieving (COMPLETELY NORMAL, I UNDERSTAND) and doesn't want to talk with me nor my parents. 

She's not isolating herself because she's been with her sisters and friends. I just... Don't know what to do to be close to her or what have I done to be ""ghosted"" by my own cousin... Literally I want to be close to her and be a support, but at the same time she doesn't show any kind of affection or closeness towards me (or my parents). It's weird, I don't know what happened in our relationship to be like that. 

What should I do? Should I bring something or let it go? Even if I go, I would be so uncomfortable and self conscious because I know she doesn't want to be close to me 😅 at the same time I want to show her that she has my support. 

Sorry if my explanation is bad, English isn't my first language. Thanks for reading 🥺  

TL;DR: I think I am being ghosted by a grieving family member. She's not isolating so it's about my parents and I and idk 😐 this is surreal and I don't know how to act or do tbh. Advice or reality check are welcome because what the hell is going on. ",2024-11-12 02:24:51

BUT…

On to the point we live together 2 years with my girl 26F, we’ve been dating for around 4.

Before living together all I could provide was like a night drink, maybe chill at my parents home because it was huge but still parents home. At that time I was a guy that was giving the minimum possible to her.

Our relationship: I am a guy that likes home.I help at chores (40% me 60% her),fondle clothes,wash dishes, I want my home to be clean (she is x3 at least more clean junkie, bearable). We usually do 2 big trips per year, one at an island (summer) and one at some country of Europe, in between we chill a lot together at home watching netflix, playing cards, going out for dinner and sometimes for drinks or other activities. Lastly but also VERY important our sex WAS let’s say above average, we like role playing, we like me using toys on her, we like to be spicy (ofc not all days are the same).There are some periods that we are also VERY different on our sexual needs, basically she has close to zero and I am Turbo, she has fallen 90% at effort, our orgasms 90% of times go 1-1. I also like to randomly spoil her, sometimes I buy her expensive stuff with money I could spend for me for things I really need, sometimes its a chocolate cause i pass at a store and think “hey this could put a smile on her face” This basically concludes our whole life.


Now on to where things started falling off a cliff. It’s a daily evening ,I organise a 3day weekend escape for us, phone call comes in, her mother is diagnosed with a bad type of breast cancer. Obviously she gets destroyed/depressed(not clinically) instantly, her parents are lovely people, I also got very sad, but hey ofc its not the same, its HER mother. Immediately our life/lifestyle gets decimated but hey I have to support her and understand that this is a situation that I have to show support.


I found one of the best doctors for her mother, even helped them move around between doctors etc.I support her dad’s moral also by hanging out.I put my personal needs under a carpet, dealt with severe negativity in our daily life from her and kissed goodbye our sex life. It’s been 8 months since then, I tried to MAKE HER HAPPY somehow. I am now kind of tired as if I do 100 things she will text me about 1 negative thing or 1 thing I forgot. Our sex transformed into “a prize”, don’t know how else to describe it seriously and there is just no way to make her happy, this Sunday I got her out for lunch and her behaviour was like I “eh our life is a routine”.


TL:DR I can’t come to accept that this new ghost of our relationship is our new norm and everything is absolutely justified indefinitely to be miserable. How is her mother’s condition relevant with describing our daily life “eh routine”. How to navigate through all this and possibly save our relationship? Has anyone had any similar experience? Can a relationship get through this to its former glory (or higher)? Thinking quite hardly it’s over and the elephant in the room is not the real issue. This is all I have to give,my prime, looks not enough.

I’m hoping to get some advice on how to improve my relationship with my boyfriend. I really care about him and don’t want to break up, but there’s been a shift recently, and I’m feeling a bit lost on how to handle it.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about four months, and while things were great at first, lately, there’s been a lot of tension. Since the beginning, he’s struggled with low energy—he’s often tired, and he seems to catch colds or feel unwell every other week, which leaves him needing to rest in bed. Despite this, he was still engaged in the relationship at first, making plans and being attentive. But over the past three weeks, he’s become more disengaged and distant.

Now, when I come over, he often seems exhausted, and sometimes he’s just staring into space. I’ve even wondered if he’s depressed. I asked him about it, and he admitted that the thought had crossed his mind. He’s also said he’s been dealing with a lot recently—he’s had a big month with travel (we went to Mexico, New York, and moved twice), plus he’s preparing for a major job interview, so it’s possible he’s simply worn out.

This shift has been tough on me. I’ve reduced the time I spend with him because I feel drained when I’m around him and he’s not present. I’ve also noticed he’s not putting in the same effort he used to. For instance, he doesn’t plan dates or keep his place stocked when I come over, which makes me feel a bit unappreciated.

I spent a lot of time planning a holiday trip to Japan for us, which he canceled at the last minute due to feeling too tired to travel. While he acknowledged how disappointing this was for me, he hasn’t offered an alternative and seems to expect me to stay home with him without any specific plans, which has left me feeling frustrated. I suggested we could still spend the holidays together if he planned something special, even if it’s at home, but it’s been challenging to get him to take the lead on anything.

I want to make this relationship work, and I know he cares about me. I don’t think he’s trying to hurt me, and he still seems to want to be with me, but I’m struggling with how to approach these issues without coming across as demanding. Is there a gentle way to encourage him to put more effort into our time together? And, for those who have partners with chronic fatigue or low energy, do you have any advice on how to make things feel balanced?

Thanks in advance for any guidance you can give!

**TL;DR:**

I spent a lot of time planning a holiday trip to Japan for my boyfriend and me, but he canceled last minute due to fatigue. While he knows I’m disappointed, he hasn’t offered an alternative and seems to expect me to stay home with him without any specific plans. I suggested he could plan something special for us at home, but he’s not taking the lead. He’s been low-energy since we met and recently more disengaged, possibly due to stress or fatigue. I don’t want to break up, but I’m feeling frustrated and unsure how to move forward. Any advice?",2024-11-11 18:53:15

We’ve been doing long distance for a couple months and the relationship has been draining me. In many ways, he is a great boyfriend and we actively talk about our future together but I feel like most of the time I’m upset by him. At first, the main problem was his communication issues when we started long distance. However, we had a chat about it and I’ll admit that he’s really improved since then. However, now he seems really unmotivated to do anything and, although we have a proper call at least once a day, he spends most of his days gaming with friends and avoiding his other responsibilities. I know it’s up to him to make a lifestyle change and so I don’t really say anything, but frankly it’s a bit worrying and uninspiring. The reason I am writing this is because, when I spoke to him today, he mentioned wanting to go travelling south east Asia for a couple months with his friend next summer. I told him it would make me pretty uncomfortable knowing he’d be spending months with his friend in a place that is notorious for partying and that maybe we could discuss/come to a compromise closer to the time. Honestly though, it hurt that he even thought doing something like that would be okay in a committed relationship. At this point I’ve realised the reason I haven’t broken up with him is (a) because I want to give it a bit of time to see if things change and (b) because right now I don’t really have solid friendships or other forms of support if I were to get out of the relationship (especially during the holidays when I’m not at university). Has anyone gone through a similar experience and can offer some advice on what I should do for myself/ is there anything I can do/say to him to at least give it one last shot? Thank you!

So basically it's just as the title says.
My boyfriend of 3y is very successful at what he does, he's finished college and now works a very fulfilling job. I'm still a student that's failed two years at medical school, back to back. I'm studying for my exams now, but I feel like I have fallen behind with everything. I've gained weight, and my hair started falling out from all the stress that's been accumulating. I feel terrible about myself but I just can't help it until I pass my exams. I know my two biggest problems are my weight rn and my exams. 
 My dear boyfriend is on a business trip now, and I can't help but feel that he'll want to find someone who is successful and someone that also looks good. I get upset even thinking about him liking someone's looks, and I fear that he doesn't feel that way about me.
I don't want to talk to him about it now, because I don't want to stress him out while he's on meetings. I also feel like I don't do enough for myself, while I know he does for himself. I want to be able to do that, and get to a point where I can be comfortable and happy with myself.
How can I do that?

He’s slowly stopped asking me to hang out as much, is with his friends, doesn’t really ask about my day as much, he only says I love you back or basically just repeats things back to me.

 I am very anxiously attached. I am in therapy. I used to spam text and call him when he was out with his friends as a fear of of getting cheated on. I’ve now tried to change my behavior and have tried doing more for me. But it seems even when I’m doing my own thing he still doesn’t even seem to try as much as before. 

I just get this feeling that if I walked away he wouldn’t even care and it hurts… He is the avoidant type he has expressed he is not emotional person and that he doesn’t feel the need to go the extra mile because we already know each other and are comfortable but I just keep getting this feeling he’s not interested as much anymore. 

I asked him if he still loves me, but I just feel overbearing. I’ve brought it up a few times over the last few months but he always says he does love, and feels the same but that he’s just not the type to be emotional. Do you guys have any advice?

We met through mutual friends and fell in love hard and fast. We had a long distant relationship (3hrs) for about 3 months until I decided to move the 3hrs away to be with him. We are in the honeymoon stage for about a year and a half. We ended up getting pregnant about 10 months in. We had multiple conversations about how our lives would change and ultimately decided to keep it. About a month after we had found out about the pregnancy I found messages from him to multiple other girls asking to hook up and just of general flirty nature. Of course I was shocked and hurt because we had just decided to keep our baby and I thought we loved each other so much. I decided to forgive him and give him another chance because I wanted this relationship and wanted us to be a family. Things seemed to be okay through the pregnancy other than his lack of respect for the fact that I was pregnant and didn’t want to go to the bar every weekend. (That’s what we did before I found out I was pregnant.) He would leave me at home almost every weekend towards the end of the pregnancy. So it’s October 2023 and we have our beautiful daughter. After this the partying and leaving me at home does not stop, along with it comes him begging me to go with him. Being a new mom I didn’t have the energy or the care to go the bar all the time with him. On Christmas of 2023 I decided to go to an nfl football game with him and I did drink and then ended up getting a DUI. I got on diversion, so with that I get random drug and alcohol tests, so again I can’t drink.  So now we are back in the spot that I was while pregnant. He wants to go out every weekend and I can’t drink. Him leaving me at home every weekend with a newborn, and then leaving me at home during the week to go smoke and hang out with his friends, caused a big riff in our relationship. I told him many times that I needed him to be there for me and our daughter more than and nothing had really changed. During this time that is really no intimacy happening because I’m exhausted from raising a new baby and he’s always gone. Forward to August 2024, everything really catches up to us and I’m miserable and so is he. I’m upset because i feel like he is not there for me and our daughter. He is mad because there is no intimacy and at this point I was losing attraction and did not want to be intimate at all. We decided to go to could counseling and I feel like he was trying but I was so turned off to everything and just felt in my gut that this would not work. After starting therapy I had found him messages a few other girls and that just turned  me off even more. 3 weeks after our daughters first birthday I decided I needed to leave so I told him that I was moving back to my parents and we could split custody of our daughter. He wants to continue to try and make things work while we are separated but I’m not sure how that would work and if I should. I would love any advice. Thank you if you’ve read this whole post.

I pushed her away with some immature (quiet, nonchalant) reactions, but still committed that 1st week on a bit of whim while drunk at a bar. Next week, she starts first week of college with a bunch of other responsibilities, and we struggle finding time to see each other and it became a burden of stress for us. we agreed to drop it, her citing her lack of time to commit to a partner rn, and remain pretty tight. I'm trying to navigate my options: how to make it work out later on, how to keep the connection, how to better support her. All in all, trying to commit again in the future.



Hey all,

So a few months ago I met an amazing girl and we instantly clicked — we would hang out all the time and it took us a few weeks to start hooking up and having sex after taking her on a few dates. All was going so smoothly until I started feeling a bit pressured to make it official 2 weeks ago. She would say harmless but intense things like “we are such a hot couple,” “our kids would look so good,” and trying to get me to meet her parents and begging to meet mine. I also talked about how I’m not really ready yet and she said “i’m right here,” as if she was waiting for it.

A week later I asked her to be my gf while we were kinda drunk at a bar, she elatedly said yes, and then things soon started getting a little too stressful, which were mainly my fault. I would get a little weird and quiet when she wouldn’t want to spend as much time with me which pushed her away, and that made me feel unwanted so i would start ignoring her a bit and distancing myself. She also just started her last year of college last week, has an internship, a young puppy, and a lot of friends, so I told her today it wasn’t fair of me to do that to her. Her week suddenly became so busy and she felt like she couldn’t satisfy my need to see each other as much.

Today we talked and agreed that we shouldn’t have moved so fast and it was a very easy and friendly talk — we just wanted to remove the extra stress. She said she has so much going on lately and needs time to get settled in with everything for the time being, which I said I totally respect — I’m also a very busy person, but I value our connection a lot and want to preserve it.

I really really like her and she really likes me, and we’re still going to be good friends, so I’m just looking for advice on how to maintain this connection and keep it on the right track — I want to keep taking it very slowly. She reassured me several times the past week (without my asking) that she’s not talking with, seeing or getting with any other guys, maybe because she wanted me to get that she’s fine taking it slow.

I’m also curious how people see things from her perspective. She has bad ADHD and likely RSD (which I just learned about) -- I know I screwed up being a bit weird but she knows that’s not how I actually am and she really is that busy now, but I’m so curious how people thinks she feels!

  
Will be taking care of her dog while she's at school tomorrow trying to help her out.

He used to follow me on social media, but all of sudden decides to unfollow me but will follow other females he doesn't know (not popular ones) and his guy friends as well. I asked him the reasoning and it was just so stupid. His reason was that some days he feels like following me and some days he doesn't? We had an argument over it but I just decided it wasn't worth it and it was childish so I let it go but it's still in the back of my mind.
I'm not sure if the way I feel is stupid, because at the end of the day its social media but it bugs me a ton. I had brought it up again a couple of weeks ago, and he said he's going to follow anyone who follows him back for now on and he's following a lot of more females. Not that it's bothering me a ton, it just makes me kind of jealous and I told him that but he just shrugged it off by saying it doesn't matter because it's not like he's texting them but still.. not sure if the way I feel is childish or not.
I really need some advice on how I should approach him about it again without having to feel childish.

TLDR: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 10 months, and he refuses to follow me on social media, but he will follow other females and his male friends and it confuses me a lot. I approached him a lot of times about it, and we even argued because of it but I had decided to let it go because I felt as if it was childish. But, it’s still in the back of my mind and it irks me a lot. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice in the comments! I couldn’t completely break up with him because I didn’t really have it in me to say it, but all I told him was that I don’t think you love me anymore and some other stuff (it was in a paragraph) then I deleted the platform where we text at so I won’t have an urge to text him back if he did message me. I guess you can say we did break up? But the words were very vague. In the end he can take it how he wants because I won’t be replying by to his messages anymore + his calls!

relationships,1goo0oc,29M Feeling like a parent to my gf (27F)?,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goo0oc/29m_feeling_like_a_parent_to_my_gf_27f/,10,"Hi everyone,

I'm in a relationship that's been going on for almost two years, and I'm struggling with some feelings that I can't seem to shake. I care about my partner, and there are things I love about her, but I feel like the dynamic between us has gradually shifted into something that feels off. I’m hoping to get some advice on how to process this and figure out whether it’s something we can work through or if this might be a deeper incompatibility.

I’m in my late 20s, with a stable career, my own place, a car, and a solid routine. My girlfriend is still a student and works part-time. Since we started dating, I’ve taken on a lot of financial and emotional support for both of us. I genuinely enjoy treating her—whether it's through dinners, travel, or just supporting her through tough times. But lately, it feels like I’m not just her boyfriend, but more like a parent.

Over time, she began spending most of her time at my place, and eventually, I suggested she move in with me. However, I’ve ended up covering all our expenses—rent, bills, groceries, car maintenance, travel, and outings. Initially, I didn’t mind; I wanted her to feel secure and focus on her studies. But as time went on, I started to feel the weight of that responsibility, especially since I didn't feel much reciprocity.

When I asked her to contribute symbolically (around 20-30% of her income) or help more with household chores, she felt I was being unreasonable. She didn’t want to contribute financially, and when we discussed chores, she expressed she didn’t want to feel like a servant. Eventually, we agreed that she would take on more chores, but even that became a point of frustration, and she would frequently push for us to hire a cleaner, expecting me to cover the cost.

Another layer is the emotional support. She’s been going through a lot with school and family issues, and I've tried my best to be there for her, helped her set up freelancing work and leave her draining job. She’s said she appreciates my support, but at the same time, she’s also told me she feels I’m not as emotionally “mature” as she’d like. I try to communicate my needs too, but sometimes I feel dismissed. It often feels like she’s looking for issues or expecting me to meet standards I didn’t even know she had. She keeps mentioning she doesn't feel 'safe' in the relationship, but I have no idea what else I can do.

Additionally, our physical intimacy has dwindled, which is another area I’ve tried to address. I expressed that physical connection is important for me in a relationship, and she did agree to work on it, but I still feel it hasn’t improved. I’m finding it hard to ignore the frustration I feel from lack of intimacy combined with this dynamic.

I feel like I'm in a role that goes beyond just being a partner. I’m financially responsible for both of us, and when I try to ask for more balance, it’s met with resistance or frustration. I’ve started to feel like I'm living with a “daughter” rather than a partner, which doesn’t sit right with me. I want to feel like we’re both bringing something to the relationship.

I’m feeling emotionally drained and, honestly, a little resentful. I’ve tried to talk to her about these feelings, but I often end up feeling like the “bad guy” or like I’m asking for too much. I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable or if these are signs of a deeper incompatibility. Has anyone experienced a similar dynamic? How did you handle it, and were you able to find a way forward?

relationships,1gp5tlc,(M32) Dating an Introvert (F26) – Navigating Personality Differences and Hoping for Advice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp5tlc/m32_dating_an_introvert_f26_navigating/,4,"I recently (\~3 months) started dating a girl I really like (I’m 32M, she’s 26F). She’s amazing—caring, sweet, comes from a good family, wants to be a mom, and she’s adorable. We have lots of physical touch, eye contact, laughter and other things that I love so far in this relationship. 

She’s very introverted, though. I’m naturally more extroverted and thrive on social interaction. On the positive side, I enjoy her calmness and the fact that she doesn’t feel the need to fill the air with small talk. But on the other hand, I thought she’d be opening up more by now. I often feel like I’m the one driving every conversation, and that can get tiring. I haven’t really been able to connect with her beyond surface level yet. In social situations, she stays very quiet and sometimes comes across as a bit unapproachable (though I wonder if I’m overanalyzing).

I took a break from serious relationships for the past few years, and now I’m realizing that I want a partner who can meet me halfway in conversation and feel comfortable in social settings. I don’t want to end something good prematurely, but I also don’t want to ignore any signs that this might be a dealbreaker.

**My questions are:**

1. Could this be an early-phase comfort issue, or should I expect this is just how she is?
2. What are some gentle ways to encourage her to open up more without making her feel pressured?
3. Has anyone been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you balance your need for more interaction with a partner’s need for quiet?

Note: I don’t want her to feel that I’m trying to change her, just hoping to connect on a deeper level for both our sakes. Any insights on how to handle this respectfully would be greatly appreciated!

relationships,1gp5anf,I (M25) have feelings for my (F23) best friend.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp5anf/i_m25_have_feelings_for_my_f23_best_friend/,0,"
Sorry in advance if this post is a bit messy—this is my first time asking for help like this.

So, it’s been six years since I first started talking to her. She’s one of my sister’s best friends, and she used to come over to our house a lot, which is how we met. We got close quickly, though for a long time, she was just my best friend—definitely not love at first sight for me.

The first three years of our friendship were pretty chaotic. We had about three or four big arguments, which sometimes led to us not speaking for months. It was always over small, dumb things, but both of us have big egos, so it made it for us to get over them. The last and biggest argument ended with us having zero contact for nearly a year. At that point, I really thought it was over, so I gave up on reaching out to her.

Turns out, it wasn’t over. A year later, one of her best friends messaged me, saying that my friend missed me, talked about me a lot, and wanted things to go back to the way they were. I was skeptical at first, but her friend convinced me to reach out, so I decided to give it a shot. I sent her a message saying that I was ready to turn the page and that i would love to talk again.

It worked. We picked up right where we left off, and our friendship only got stronger after that. We still had occasional arguments, but we handled them much better than before, which was a huge improvement.

In May 2023, she stopped going to school and asked if I wanted to work with her. At the time, I was 21 and had never had a real job because of severe social anxiety and depression. The idea of working with her gave me the push I needed to overcome some of those problems, so I agreed. We worked together at a company similar to Amazon, but for food. Things went really well, and for the first time in a long time, I started to feel mentally better.

That’s when i started to have feelings for her. She was making my life so much better, and I couldn’t help but fall for her. We worked together from May 2023 to January 2024.

Now, she’s back in school, and I’m focused on getting my driver’s license. Things are still really good between us—she calls me for hours nearly every day, and I see her often. But here’s the thing: I’m in love with her, and I feel like it’s hopeless. I don’t think she feels the same way about me, and that brings me to my problem.

I want to tell her how I feel and find out what she thinks, but I’m really afraid it will ruin our friendship. If it goes badly, I’ll be alone. She's my only friend.

Whats the best way to deal with this without ruining our friendship?

TL;DR: i (25M) has developed feelings for my (23F) best friend, but im afraid confessing might ruin our close friendship. She's my only friend, and im pretty sure she doesnt feels the same way",2024-11-11 22:33:12
relationships,1gozgpe,"What should I do when my girlfriend’s (21F) actions raise red flags for me (21M), despite a supportive, caring relationship?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gozgpe/what_should_i_do_when_my_girlfriends_21f_actions/,2,"TL;DR: I (21M) have been dating my girlfriend, Angel (21F), for a year in what’s been my first supportive, long-term relationship. But certain behaviors raise red flags, like her strong need for privacy with her phone and reluctance to post about me on social media, which feels one-sided when she goes through my phone while I’m asleep. My gut is telling me something’s off, and I’m not sure if it’s my past experiences with cheating or if I should address these concerns with her.

We’ll call her Angel. We’ve been dating for a year now, and it’s my first serious, long-term relationship. My previous relationships were like a mixed bag of disappointment, either with people who treated dating like a free-for-all or ended with me finding out I’d been cheated on. So this relationship has been a refreshing change: we’ve supported each other mentally and emotionally, and it’s honestly been the best I’ve had.

But lately, I can’t ignore these little red flags that keep popping up, probably because of my past experiences with cheating. Angel is an online college student and doesn’t work, so she’s home most of the time. I’m not really worried about her “seeing” other people, but a few things about her behavior just don’t sit right with me.

The first issue is her attitude toward privacy. In the entire year we’ve been together, I don’t think I’ve ever held her phone for more than a minute without her getting visibly anxious and yanking it back. I’ve tried to ask her about it calmly, but her answer is always the same: “Privacy is really important to me.” I get it—I want to respect her boundaries—but imagine how it feels for me, someone who’s been cheated on and tends to overthink things. The double standard really hits me, too: a few times, she’s gone through my phone while I was asleep and called me out on things like following girls on Instagram or watching porn. It just feels a little one-sided and stirs up this weird gut feeling I can’t ignore.

The second issue is her social media presence. I like sharing photos of us on Instagram; I want to show her off, I guess. But she hasn’t posted me at all. For Halloween, we did a little photoshoot, and I posted it both on my story and as a regular post. She put it on her story but not as a post, which felt… off. When I tried to joke around and ask why she hadn’t posted it, she dodged the question and said, “I posted you on my story, at least.” It’s not a huge deal, but again, it makes me feel like I’m being hidden.

All these little things—her phone, her social media—should be minor, but my gut just keeps waving little red flags. Part of me feels guilty for even doubting her, but it’s hard to shake that feeling. I don’t know if it’s just my past baggage creeping in or if there’s something deeper going on. What should I do?",2024-11-11 18:36:37
relationships,1gph1pi,TL;DR My partner (22nb) shaved their head and i hate it. (22 nb) ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gph1pi/tldr_my_partner_22nb_shaved_their_head_and_i_hate/,9,"TL;DR 
so, the title says it all. i went to bed and my partner had thick curly raven hair then i wake up and they are completely hairless; eyebrows and any body hair included.

 i love them more than ive ever loved anyone and we've been together 2+ yrs so obviously the intense emotional attraction is still there but the physical is gone. it's also really hard because i always saw doing someone's hair as a form of intimacy and i enjoyed immensely the roll of taking care of their hair. 

it feels like i lost a way to show love. they didn't talk to me about it or anything, just woke me up out of a dead sleep with their baldness. i don't want /expect them to ask me for any kinda premission but i feel like i deserved a heads up. i loved ALL their body hair, i thought it was very beautiful and i think they are very beautiful now. 

i just don't nessasarly feel physically attracted to them anymore. i am attracted to their soul and i can't imagine not wanting to do anything romantic/sexual  with them, especially over something as lame as hair. it's just hard to look at them. i feel like i just wanna cry.

 i keep thinking about all the nights i stayed up late to oil and braid their hair. i think about all the hair clips i made for them for our anniversary. god it's so stupid. i know it's just hair. i know it will come back. i hate that i feel this way. 

Im not getting into it but because of recent events they've been very afraid as a trans person ( we both are trans).they told me they shaved their head because they didn't feel safe and were scared someone was going to attack them and use it against them. they shared with me memories of how their dad pulled them around by their hair and in times like these they becoma very scared it would happen again as hate crimes rise.

 i don't even think they really like it either, they told me they missed their hair and i just wanted to cry. i wish they talked to me earlier because i know with all the rising danger their PTSD had been really bad and i feel we could have talked to resolve their fear instead of this. i hate this. i even shaved my head too because it hurt their feelings that i didn't like it and i fucking loved my haircut. ive had my head shaved before and i loved it and at this time i had a mohawk so it wasn't a big deal. i loved my mohawk but i loved seeing my wife smile more. i know how scared they've been and i wanted to show them we are in this together, even in baldness. 

i just want to feel the same intense physical attraction i felt before. i want my wife to sit in my lap and talk to me while i do their hair again. i still do our friends but it's not the same. i want them back. maybe i just need to get used to it but right now i just keep crying. i want them to feel safe. i want their hair back.

so my questions are; what do i do with all these feelings I'm having ? i don't want to make them feel worse but i don't want to bottle them up till they feel like I'm not talking to them. is there anyway i can be more supportive? was it fair that i feel like a heads up would have been nice so we could talk about their fear before this extreme happened ? am i being a bad partner because im having such a hard time over their hair ?

What do you think?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gpf72i/i_25m_love_my_girlfriend_25f_but_i_dont_know_if/,25,"Alright, here’s the deal: I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years and a few months. The woman I am with is absolutely wonderful. She has a tremendous heart, is very empathetic and sweet. She’s fun to be around, knows how to get everyone dancing at a party, and is a hard worker. We understand and accept each other’s quirks, and I think that our personalities balance each other out very well. Weaknesses in my character are strengths in hers, and vice versa. When I look at her, I feel a deep desire to protect her and care for her, and I love her very much. Her and I are both good at resolving conflict, we’ve probably had 3 fights max and we resolve them quickly and kindly, and both of us are capable of apologizing when we’ve done wrong. She’s also unquestionably loyal, and 100% committed to me and the idea of marrying me. I also think she would be a tremendous mother, and a wonderful wife. Not to mention, she is drop dead gorgeous, way out of my league. 

However, I still have reservations. And because she doesn’t, I am feeling a lot of pressure to resolve this internally soon, because I know she deserves to be with someone who is in it 100%. 

For one, we have virtually no common interests. I can’t really think about anything we both enjoy doing together on its own merit, it feels more like we’re both humoring each other. This alone I don’t think would be a problem for me, but I fear that we are not really “intellectually compatible” either. And don’t get me wrong, she is very intelligent. More so than me in many different ways. She’s currently going to medical school and she is very book smart and is going to be an ace in the field she’s going into. But I am kind of a cerebral and analytical guy, and this is not her whatsoever. I enjoy deep conversations and her and I almost never have conversations with substance that I particularly care about. The way a mutual friend of us both puts it, I am more of an ideas guy while she is a people’s person. She could talk for a long time about like what her neighbor is up to or what her friends did over the weekend, and I frankly am not stimulated by these kinds of conversations whatsoever. It’s taken me a long time to articulate what the core difference is here, but I think I have figured it out: My girlfriend’s interests revolve almost entirely around her friends, her family, and work, and she does not spend much time talking or thinking about anything else. There are a million examples, but the most recent one that made me realize this was when I told her that the IDF claimed to have taken out a leader of Hamas, to which she replied “What’s hamas?” And I don’t judge her for this, it’s even respectable, but I am the complete opposite. I would much rather discuss things in the world as opposed to work, friends, family. 

It extends into other facets as well. Because she works so hard, shes a person who likes to turn her brain off whenever she’s not in school or on the job. And while I completely understand this, that isn’t me at all. TV and books are something we both enjoy, but where I like to watch dramas with more “well written” stories and enjoy classic literature, she likes true crime, my 600 pound life, and the “cheesy, stupid romance books” (her words, not mine). If we watch something together, when it’s over I enjoy discussing it, while she will just say “that was really good/bad” and that’s all she has to say, and I can’t really get more out of her. I keep up with current events, politics, science, etc., and she does not at all. If I bring up a topic to discuss and it’s outside her wheelhouse, I usually get hit with “I don’t know anything about that.” and that is the end of the discussion. I feel like she does not humor me in the same way that I humor her by listening to her talk about people in her life or make small talk. I understand that no person ever checks every box for someone, and I do not check every box for her, but I fear that in the long run this may be an issue for me. I don’t think I would care about the intellectual incompatibility if we had more in common, and conversely, I don’t think I would care about the lack of common interests if our brains worked a little more similarly. Worth noting that I feel this disconnect less when we are together, but daily texting and phone calls are when I feel it the most. Honestly, after 10 minutes of talking on the phone, I’ve had my fill. And I feel like that is not the best sign. 

The only other real issue is that I am not sexually satisfied either. She was a virgin before we started dating, and I also know that she tragically experienced an instance of sexual trauma before we got together. I was not aware of this for the first two years we were together (which is surprising because we tell each other everything, but in this time she had also not told anybody else about it either). The few times we tried having sex, she was in intense pain the entire time, to the point where I did not feel comfortable continuing, despite her still wanting to. I chalked it up to her being a virgin and it potentially hurting the first few times, but after 5 or so attempts, it did not go away. I did not initiate sex after because I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable, and she didn’t initiate because she was obviously not looking forward to experiencing the pain she has felt. Now that we have discussed the sexual trauma, I am not really sure what to make of things. She does not believe the pain to be psychosomatic and thinks it is solely a physical problem. I feel like it may be both. However, during a routine check up with her OB, her doctor said that she does not see any indication of a physical issue, but she would have to come back for a more focused examination to see if there is a problem. During the most recent instance of us having sex, it went better than previous attempts. After the fact, I asked her if she had experienced pain and she said it was only during the initial insertion. I asked her if she experienced and pleasure and she replied with “a little, but honestly, I don’t know if I will ever get pleasure from having penetrative sex.” And this was very discouraging to me. I have had many sexual partners over the years, and this has never been the case. And most of my sexual enjoyment is the feeling of pleasing someone else, and I fear that sex would just be a chore for her in the long term. 

So, I feel like I am in quite the predicament. They say that there are 4 pillars of relationship satisfaction: Emotional (are you comfortable expressing yourself, do you and your partner feel safe together, do you hear each other, etc.), romantic (is there affection and gestures of love), intellectual, and sexual. While we have the an abundance of the first two, the latter two are obviously lacking for me. I feel as if I could compromise on one of these not being completely met, but not both. I also don’t know if my reservations would go away if I was getting laid, and if my subconscious is just looking for problems. But I really do love this woman, and we are both good for each other in so many ways. I am happy to be dating her now, but when I think 10, 30, 50 years down the line, I get nervous that it may not be right for me. I am afraid of walking away from someone who is so special, but I am also afraid of wasting her and my time if it really isn’t meant to be. It’s been over two years and I just don’t feel like I *know*, and I’m not sure at what point I should know. Is two years enough to be sure? At what point is uncertainty a sign of it’s own?

I think that both the sexual and common interests issues can be resolved over time, but I am not sure. My impulse is also that I would enjoy living with her and that things would get better for me, but there’s obviously no way to know that unless we do. And let me make it clear, I don’t know how this post sounds to an outsider, but I would not change a thing about her. As far as I’m concerned, she’s perfect. This is only a question of whether or not I can make it work with who I am as a person. Any advice or perspective you guys have is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Or am I being extra crazy? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp2md8/should_we_break_up_or_am_i_being_extra_crazy/,1,"Hello everyone, thanks for reading this and I hope anyone reading can give me their thoughts on this from an outsider perspective.

I (32F) have  been dating my partner(30M) for over 6 years. We met working in retail and we were good friends for a year before we started dating. As friends, he would tell me about the girls he fancied or date, and I would give him advices on what to do bc my guy had zero skills 😌
He then started “dating” a girl from work. They would go to out and stuff but they never kissed or sex, and fell out eventually. 
Once we started dating, a few months later, I was jealous to see them talk around the shop, my friends who also worked there would tell me they would catch them talking all the time whenever I was off.
He always denied this, or said it was work related only. One time I caught them like 3 times in the span of 1 hour and he he would tell me it was just her doing the talk and he ignore her (?) …. I am jealous, but for me it’s more the fact I know he was lying every time… 
Then… Covid happened, we moved in together, finish our degrees, and we both ended up working from home. Now we spend 24/7 together and we love spending all the time together.

Now the problem starts here: in his team there is a new lady. I didn’t think any of it for months because … work from home.. so who cares 😅 but now a few months later I can tell how his voice changes every time he talks to her during online meetings, he’s starting to go to the office more often at least once a week(from never going), and recently he went for a work event and he came home a bit drunk and was telling me how much fun he had, how much he danced, the free alcohol… and from what he was telling almost everybody left except 5-6 people, including her.
I was glad he had fun and made friends but I have this gut feeling something is not right again….  I have asked him directly if he likes her and he said no and told me her again like if she was old (3 years older than me).
Then the working day after this day out, he was on a meeting and I could tell it was her by his voice tone. He kept laughing and saying things like “oh I don’t remember” “it’s all a blur” 
Because our relationship had that rookie beginning of weird lies, and then it was just us 2 inside the house all the time in our little bubble, I feel that I go right back to that moment where I can see one thing but he’s telling me everything it’s okay.

One side of me wants to break up because I don’t fully trust him and I don’t think I ever did… I am summarising a lot but I did catch him on other lies i.e giving money to his family when we were struggling and him denying- I saw the bank statement etc 
The other side of me wants to stay because I love him so much and want to work this out but it’s not something I can help much, it’s this body response, the fire of the jealousy, no trust, the lies…

Am I overthinking this ? I don’t want to bring this up to him because I’m afraid to start having a toxic relationship- help 🥹

He has a daughter who is 16 now. My brother and his wife use drugs together a lot. I know his daughter must be aware. He told me he will take molly with his wife when he has his daughter too (his daughter mostly lives with her grandmother on her mom's side, the mom passed away when she was 12).

My brother's addiction has always been a hushed secret in my family. He was in and out of rehabs and jail when he was a teen when I was growing up, and my parents would just give me vague lies as to where he had disappeared to for weeks. Now I am quite distanced from all of my family--I live a happy life, love my job, own my own home. The past few years my brother mostly calls me when he is high on ecstasy (likely laced with meth) so the convo is 90% him and I have to basically yell to get any word in.

I've had a small convo with him before about not using drugs when he's around his daughter. He just says 'yeah I take molly around her, I have long deep conversations with her' and it's always really obvious when he's on it, he talks a lot. The drug has changed him over the years. I'm ashamed that I've seemingly enabled this. I've told my parents but they are deep in denial and get angry if I bring it up and get very defensive.

How do I have this conversation with my brother? How do I not enable this behavior? Is it better to just cut him off?

When we met and fell in love, I was all in on being a parent and a partner. I didn’t just fall in love with her but her son as well. This was who I wanted to spend my life with. This is my family.

But this life is really, really difficult. Her son is really difficult. He’s so great, so smart and loving, but he demands so much of my time, energy and attention and I don’t feel like I have the bandwidth for him. Or her for that matter. And I understand this is the nature of parenting and to some extent being in a relationship, but I just feel like I am not recovering from my days and that I don’t have the time or space that I need for myself. 

I feel like I’m living in pure chaos. I wake up and get ready for work and I’m *so lucky* if I get some time to myself in the morning to get ready, but if he wakes up around the time I do, which is often, it’s just constant noise and demands and antagonizing the cats etc. then I work all day at a job I can barely do due to pure exhaustion, I come home and either prepare dinner and clean or go to side gig because my first job doesn’t pay enough (even though I’m a federal employee) where I average 3hrs a week but it’s mentally taxing and requires preparatory work on off days. Then I come home and cook if I didn’t before and help with bedtime etc. and then the night is over, and I’m so stressed I can barely sleep, and I need like 10hrs of sleep to be halfway functioning.

Weekends are awful because he demands 100% of our energy and attention from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed and nothing we’ve done so far helps to mediate that. 

I’m sure you notice there’s no time for myself or my partner or for herself in here. 

About 8 months in we started talking about living together. It really seemed right. Once we made the decision to do it there started to be some friction between us and I took that as a sign that it wasn’t the right time. I brought this up and she was so resistant, she was dead set that was *had* to do it, that we were too far in to the process to back out. I knew we weren’t but also wanted things to work and decided we could make this life what we want it to be. So we moved in together

Our relationship has really fallen apart since moving in together and honestly we’re more parents than partners. I can’t recall the last time we spent any time together by ourselves. I know there’s alot of resentment between us because of the demands her son places on us and the energy we lack to keep up with him. She’s just as exhausted and stressed as I am. 

This resentment, stress and exhaustion has turned to conflict and we’re fighting more and more. 

One big issue between us is that I have some health issues. I’ve been diagnosed with sleep apnea, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia along with some cardiovascular stuff. I’m beyond exhausted 24/7 and it’s taken a toll on my mental health and my stress tolerance is almost non-existent. Stuff that never used to stress me out just sends me over the edge. It’s tough to live through, and for her it’s tough to live *with*. 

She feels that I take up all the emotional space in the relationship, and I’m certain I do, I’m just trying to survive the discomfort I’m in 24/7. 

She’s also very dismissive of my health issues. She doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with me and thinks I’m either just depressed and/or a hypochondriac. It’s incredibly problematic for me to be going through something so devastating and to have my partner think I should just be able to “get through it”.

Either way this is too much for both of us. 

But the issue is her son. Obviously we both love him and wish we could give him a better quality of life. 

His dad, who wasn’t a great or even good dad, but was in his life, unexpectedly passed away recently and now I’m his only dad. He thinks I’m his dad, he’s always called me dad(dy) and we never really tried to correct him because we didn’t think he was old enough to understand and were going to explain the situation to him eventually and allow him to choose how he wants to call me. 

So I’m here in this relationship and family I’m not happy or fulfilled in and thinking of this little boy who needs a dad and the devastation my leaving would cause him. 

I feel like I’ve done my best to try and improve our situation but nothing seems to have improved or gotten better. It’s just constant chaos. 

Anyways, I think it could be better if we separate and she eventually finds someone else who can be a better parent and partner for her and her son but I know that won’t be easy for either of them. 

And I also think this could just be a difficult season, and as her son ages we can have more time and space for ourselves and each other- but I also don’t know if the resentment is too great for that. 

This isn’t an easy decision to make so any advice is appreciated 

**TL;DR** I’m contemplating ending things with my partner because our relationship is too overwhelming but her son thinks I’m his dad, and I am raising him as if he is my son, and I’m conflicted about abandoning him. But I currently don’t see any alternatives. Advice is greatly appreciated ",2024-11-11 15:55:08
relationships,1go0hkr,"My sister's husband hit on me, I'm so confused about how to deal with this. I'm so angry. ",256,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go0hkr/my_sisters_husband_hit_on_me_im_so_confused_about/,89,"Two nights ago, my husband, I (F37), my sister (26) and her husband (29) and a group of friends went up to a cabin in the mountains and had a private rave, which is something we do once or twice a year. Obviously, people were on a bunch of stuff, so everyone was high, dancing and enjoying their time. 

My husband and my sister's husband are very close friends since before we even met them. We've all been married for 4 years now, we have a baby, and they have their first one on the way, which they just found out about exactly 3 days ago. My guts keep telling me that he's not happy with the news, but my sister is insisting that he wants this. 

For more context, the four of us are very close, we live close to each other, and we spend all our weekends together, they babysit our baby alot, we're a family and becoming an even more like a real family since our children are going to be cousins. 

Obviously my sister didn't take any drugs and she went to sleep relatively early than the rest of us. 

Her husband and I got to talking as we always do, now about pregnancy and the new exciting life and all that. At some point I got cold and he put his jacket on me and I said something like I'm getting old and I'm cold easily, and how tired I am being a mom and I feel old. he tells me how beautiful I am, or how any guy would want to be with me.

 So far this is very normal, he's like a brother to me and I appreciated what he said. But then he wouldn't stop with the compliments, it got too much that I felt so uncomfortable, he was being very touchy, he made it seem like it was a brotherly love or whatever, but the vibe was so not that. 

The way he was looking at me, what he would say, and the way he put his hand on my shoulder or hugged me, it was absolutely a romantic vibe. But then I realized I'm high, and he's also high, and I thought there was absolutely no way he would hit on me, and im just reading the signs wrong. Maybe it started in my head, and I made it bigger than it is, so I decided to give it another chance just so he'd prove me wrong, and it's really not that. 

But as the night went on, wherever I went he followed, and tried so hard to keep the same conversation going, it started to feel like he was flirting with me hard and my anxiety spiked and I totally bad tripped for the last 3 hours. 

What the f*** is he doing? If he is going to do this, why on earth would he choose his wife's sister, AND his friend's wife to do this with? He knows very very well that I'd do anything to protect my sister. Even from him. Is he sabotaging his relationship on purpose? 

I don't understand! But then again I keep thinking that he was on a lot of stuff, and maybe it was the love drug talking, BUT, there's always a limit you can't cross, no matter how high you are, you are still aware of who I am, aware of what you're saying and talking, and aware that you're married and you're wife is sleeping in the room inside.

Obviously I have to tell my sister. But how? She's in the excitement phase, she just learned she's pregnant, she loves him very much. He also adores her so much which is why I'm so confused. 

As soon as we left the next morning I told my husband everything, and I cried so much. His advice was that I wait a few days, that my sister's husband is still in shock with the news and could be affecting his behaviour, and after that to talk to him privately, straight out ask him what da f*** was that about, and that he made me so uncomfortable and thought it was inappropriate. 

** TL;DR; : But shouldn't my sister know of this?
Would she build resentment towards me later if she did? What if by telling her I destroy their marriage, everything falls apart, so many what if's! ",2024-11-10 13:19:05

 for 4 years now, we have a child together. We had to move in with my mom about a year ago due to financial reasons. Before we moved in, we were going through new born/infant phase, postpartum phase, all of that. Our child will be 2 this year, we haven't had sex in 15 months, we don't date, we don't do anything really, we don't even watch TV alone or sleep in the same room anymore (I moved into the guest room after a surgery 4 months ago and never went back to our room). 


I'm just about over this relationship. We've been operating as roommates for almost 2 years. He's content...comfortable even. And this actually pisses me off. That he's so content he's not willing to try harder for us, he doesn't think there's a problem, and he doesn't want to break up our ""family"". But im honestly not happy. Idk what to do. He's a good dad to our kid, but im afraid that if I try to leave he's going to use his family leverage to gain custody and by leverage I mean money to pay for a good family lawyer. 


I'm still young, I also want more kids. I know he doesn't and this is new. Before kids, we had talked about both wanting at least 2. He doesn't want to be an ""old dad"", so whenever people ask he automatically shuts down the conversation, or if I ask he glosses over it and changes the topic.
He's a very petty guy and I know if I tell him I'm done, he's going to make my hell. I honestly don't want to go through that. Am I stupid for staying??

tl;dr: 4 year relationship, 1 kid, no sex in 15months. There's no emotional ties really and I want to leave. We don't seem to want the same things anymore and I'm tired of him not trying. Should I leave? Am I stupid for staying? ",2024-11-11 01:34:17

Basically, one of our other friends dated this girl briefly and we befriended her. Then he completely lied to her about sleeping with other people and she moved across the country for him. He then ghosted her and she’s feeling really depressed. She knows no one here and me and my other girl friend have felt bad for her. She had been asking for a few months for all of us to hangout and so I invited her out to drinks with me and my friend. I did tell my guy friend (the one who ghosted her) that me and my other friend liked her and we would be hanging with her once a month or so. He was fine with that. 

We got kind of drunk and I invited her to hang out back at my house. I happen to live right next door to my best friend and her husband. Everyone was over there (not the girls ex) and I just brought her over to hangout with us. The night started fine but then I guess she got super drunk and some of the guys were offering her a spliff and other drugs. She got super hammered and started being flirtatious with my best friends husband and saying weird things. Then I guess she had pulled aside all of her exes friends (my friends too) and was venting to them about how she’s depressed and how much she loves him etc. 

I did not know any of this as no one told me. The next day I woke up to a slew of texts from my friends saying they never want her invited anywhere again and if I want to hangout with her I need to do it away from them. They also were saying she was crazy when only a month ago all of them were on her side and even had to have discussions with our friend for how he was treating her. 

I felt super caught off guard and like everyone was blaming me. I had no idea she was going to act like that and I felt really bad for bringing her around. 

Eventually they apologized and understood I invited her because I do feel for her. But ultimately I do not want the drama. My best friend then told me apparently our friend had specifically asked her not to hangout with this girl. I didn’t know that at all. She then said she was going to tell him about what had happened and I just know she’s going to blame it all on me. 

My best friend is now treating me weird and won’t talk to me. How do I handle this situation now? 

Tl;dr I invited a girl over that my best friend ended up not liking and now she’s mad at me. ",2024-11-11 20:53:52

I do struggle with a lot anxiety involving my relationships, but I tend to not let it get under my skin. 

Anyways, so I've been mentally prepping for her to go on vacation for 2 weeks with her family for awhile and making sure we spend a lot of time together before she leaves. 

Two days before her leaving, she and I went to a concert together on the 6th of November, and after it was over, we drove us back to my house and we started saying our usual goodbyes and as she was leaving, I stopped her and I said, ""HEY, can I tell you something."" And she responded with ""yeah!"" And it kinda got awkward and eventually after an awkward silence I said, ""I love you."" In the most awkward WAY possible and she looked at me.. AWKWARDLY. She then said, ""Aww.."" she pauses again.. ""Love you too."" And we both walked off.

I instantly freaked out and soon as I walked into my house, crying and having a full blown panic attack because it was so intense and soon as I calmed down I called her on the phone and our conversation went,

Me:  ""Hey.. I'm sorry how awkward that was.""

Her: ""Its fine [redacted] it's okay.""

Me: ""Are you sure?""

Her: ""I think you're anxious. It's okay.""

(Then some unnecessary short words and call ends)

But I still felt unsatisfied. I knew because that ""I love you"" was truly in the moment. I felt wrong because it does not feel fully right to me. I was so caught up in the moment of missing her and sad that we were not gonna see each other, that those words came off so strangely and not authentic at all. Love is such a strong word to me and if I am saying, ""I love you"" to someone I'm dating then, I'm saying cause I'm in LOVE, but I am not in love with her, but I love our relationship. It's so important to me. She is so important to me and finally felt like I'm in a healthy dynamic

I told her that I want our relationship to be slow so, it felt like I was going backwards when saying, ""I love you"" that day because deep down I am not at the level to say, ""I love you"" at least not yet. I have love for her, but in the way where I am in love. 

She won't be back in town for another week. Should I communicate this with her once she returns? Any criticism or advice is accepted. I just want to be honest and communicative. 

TD;LR: I was so wrapped up in the moment with my girlfriend when she was leaving to go on her vacation and said ""I love you"" but did not fully mean it.",2024-11-11 16:58:44

just a little update here, didn’t mention anything and i’m just gonna forget about the whole messages thing. 

1 interesting thing though, i noticed he’s had dating apps installed on his phone from earlier this year, they’ve been deleted since but he’s only just cancelled his sub to a dating app a few months ago too 

this can’t be innocent right?



ORIGINAL POST 

for a little context, me and my husband have been together for 7 years and got married a few months ago. 

we’re happy and are looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together and i honestly haven’t felt happiness like this in a longgggg time. 

i recently had some weird feeling and decided to snoop through his phone, i know this was wrong but it’s done now 

anyway, come to find that he was messaging a girl in the first couple months of us dating - it’s important to note that he used to see this girl before we started dating - and the messages were along the lines of missing her, wanting to meet up but not being able to, and telling her how good she looked. 

now i know this happened 7 years ago and there’s only been a happy birthday text since, we’ve come so far since then and literally fought tooth and nail to be able to get married and we are genuinely so in love and so happy, do i even mention this or forget about it completely?  

TL;DR feeling a bit at a loss here, when i saw these messages my heart actually broke but we’ve been through everything together and i don’t know if it’s worth mentioning something that happened 7 years ago when we’ve gotten through so much to be where we are now ",2024-11-12 02:24:05
relationships,1gow7pm,How do I continue to show up as caregiver when I’m at my wits end? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gow7pm/how_do_i_continue_to_show_up_as_caregiver_when_im/,8,"I (f27) have been acting as a caregiver for my boyfriend (m26) and I don’t know how to continue without it causing more harm to the relationship. 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend has been sick for months and we don’t know what it is. I moved in temporarily to help take care of him so he can focus on work and school. But I’ve been losing so much sleep because of this. 

To give more context we moved to a new city for both of our jobs. I moved first and got settled in, and he came up second and he got settled in his own place. During this we noticed that he seemed to be getting sucked but not the cold/flu way. Every week since September there’s been 1-2 doctor’s appointments or tests so we can figure it out. 

It made sense for me to move in with him to help take care of household things since he is still in school. The hope was that this would help him to get some rest. Instead he is putting in more effort for school (which isn’t a bad thing but not what was intended). 

The thing is, for the past 2.5 months I have been sleeping on the couch. And then he wakes me up if he stays up too late gaming, or if he needs a snack (he’s in a studio) or lately it’s been that he needs comfort. I suggested me sharing his bed to help with some of this but he says it’s get too hot otherwise. 

My body is so sore from the stupid couch. Just last night we switched because he wanted the windows by the couch open so I finally got to sleep in a bed. My body hurts so much today. And the switch happened at 2am so I am exhausted. 

To top it all off we are in a new city and we’ve only explored the five blocks right by his place. He hasn’t even seen where I live. There’s so many things I wanted to do but they keep getting put off. 

I don’t know how we can continue like this without causing harm to the relationship. It feels like when I bring it up he half listens and picks out the small things (like sharing a bed) and says how it will affect him rather than listening to how it affects me first. How do I navigate this?

Edit to add: we've been datong a year and a half at this point. And no he isnt death's door sick but it also is just a lot little things that makes life harder",2024-11-11 16:27:21
relationships,1gp1t2u,I (22M) feel like my girlfriend (22F) may be straying away from our relationship through the disguise of an “individual growth journey”,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp1t2u/i_22m_feel_like_my_girlfriend_22f_may_be_straying/,12,"My girlfriend and I recently had a disagreement that pushed her to feel even more disconnected from herself. She’s spiritual and usually feels in tune with her thoughts and emotions but she’s recently felt out of touch and with the recent tension between us she’s began questioning if she can keep working on herself while staying in the relationship or if she needs to leave. I’d expressed things that had been bothering me, and although her actions weren’t meant to hurt me, they still affected my feelings.


We decided to stay together but take some time to focus on individual growth, committing to a few priorities that we’d both work on. For instance, we agreed to stay off social media, especially because although I love when she posts herself, she made men feel enabled by reacting and commenting back which I found disrespectful because if it was the other way around she would. We also agreed to prioritize financial stability, and to focus on healthier habits. I’ve been sticking to these priorities, using this time to also focus on my own self-love, consistency and my anger. But when we talk (I allow her to reach out to respect her space), I notice she’s not putting the same effort into those goals we discussed, and I’ve found that she’s back on social media. I know everyone grows at their own pace, but it’s confusing to feel like I’m putting in so much effort when she seems less consistent.


So I’m coming here for advice on a couple things:

How can I tell if I’m setting healthy boundaries with the social media qualm (and in general) or acting out of anxious attachment?

Is there a way I can approach my individual journey without allowing her inconsistency to impact me as much? 

Is there something I’m not seeing by her being less consistent with me even before the break and her being more consistent on social media? 



TL;DR: My girlfriend has been feeling disconnected from herself, and this amplified because of comments I made of how certain things she did that may have been unintentional on her end still hurt me. Over time this constantly led her to question if she could continue her growth while staying in the relationship without causing me pain or if she needed to break up. because she kept hurting me. We agreed to stay together and work on ourselves individually, setting goals to prioritize during this time. However, I’m noticing that she hasn’t been following through on the priorities we both agreed upon. While I understand growth happens at different paces, it’s been confusing for me as I’ve committed to these goals while she seems less consistent.",2024-11-11 20:10:51
relationships,1goik4m,break up? or no? ,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goik4m/break_up_or_no/,11,"so me f(17) and my bf m(16) have been dating for a year and a half. lately, things have been weird. his parents have always been weird (specifically his mom). i’ve already decided that i’m not attracted to him, but i choose to make it work. i’ve set boundaries, which he constantly ignores. such as not being in my personal space all the time, or how i don’t want to PDA all the time. we’ve had an issue a few weeks ago(MAYBE about a month ago) where i found out he was sending (?) nudes of another girl to another guy. i knew he was catfishing, but i thought it was a joke like teenage boys to. obviously, i was upset. at that moment was when everyone told me to leave him since he’s already shown a bunch of red flags. but, today was different. we were sitting there at brunch with his parents and his grandmother, who is usually tolerable sometimes. but i was talking about how i was excited to get a tattoo, since i have multiple piercings and i wanted to try something new. she doesn’t even try to joke with me, but says the typical “you can take piercings out but not tattoos” so i told her it’s been something i’ve been thinking about for a while, and the design had  changed once before. she proceeded to say “if you get a tattoo you must hate your life”. but i brushed it off. my mother and i have been through a lot. her more so me. i told her that she went with me to get a another nose piercing since it was the first one we did together.  what was her response? “she must hate her life”. NOBODY stuck up for me or tried to make light of it. i was expecting him to say something since i ALWAYS stuck up for him and dropped friends for him. i’ll list off some red flags incase you guys are curious:

he’s a complete mamas boy, which is fine when you treat her right, not when you’re nearly 17, still having your mom wash and fold your laundry. 

his grandma cleans his bathroom, to the point where he doesn’t know that you’re supposed to USUALLY use a toilet scrubber thing. 

i have made my points about personal space, and not wanting to.. yk all the time. which at first he respected, but then began to not respect it. 

he likes to apologize, but not know for what. when the whole catfishing thing happened, he was apologizing. but it was clear he didn’t know what he did was wrong. even when i tried to put it in my perspective for him. 

he knows that i’m a people pleaser, which is why i give in easily when it comes to stuff. and he takes advantage of that. 

i told him that i feel like his mom is pulling us apart (she claims they struggled so bad in cali, but moved here to tx. and now that he has friends and a gf, she wants to move back to cali and expects me to go with them even though she knows i can’t/wont)

i’m FORCED to go to church with them every sunday. and if i don’t he makes me feel terrible. 

i’m trying to figure out what i’m supposed to do. everyone sees all of these other red flags that i’m missing. i need some advice??

relationships,1gov8t0,How do I (24M) tell my fiancé (35M) I'm worried he's not as excited about our wedding as I am?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gov8t0/how_do_i_24m_tell_my_fiancé_35m_im_worried_hes/,150,"Hey Reddit, this feels super weird to type out, but I’ve been reading a lot here lately and really need some perspective. I, 24F, just got engaged to my fiancé “James” (35M), who I’ve known since I was 17.

A bit of background: we met through family friends. His mom and mine are super close, so he was around a lot growing up. At the time, I thought he was just this cool older guy – he was 28, I was 17, and I honestly thought I was just lucky to be around someone as “mature” as him.

He used to tease me a lot back then, saying things like, “You’re just a kid,” or, “Maybe when you grow up, you’ll know how to keep up with me.” That kind of stuff. My parents used to laugh it off, thinking it was funny, but I guess it really stuck with me. I always felt like I had to prove myself to him, and it didn’t change much when we started dating for real when I was 20. He’s got this way of making you feel like you’re lucky he’s giving you attention, you know?

So, in total, we've been together for almost four years now.

At first, he was super charming. He’d buy me gifts, take me out, and he even got me into drinking. I’d never really been into alcohol before, but he’d make fun of me if I didn’t drink with him. He’d say stuff like, “Come on, are you really that innocent?” or, “Stop acting like a little girl.” One night, I got really drunk and things went further than I’d planned. I wanted to talk about it afterward, but he brushed it off, saying I was “just playing hard to get.” That situation partly made me second-guess our relationship for a while since I'd never seen myself as the type of girl who'd do things like that. I felt kind of disgusted and honestly unsettled after that experience, but I didn't want to bother him anymore, so I decided to not say anything else.

Whenever I'm upset, though, I always make it a point to talk it out with my mom so I get a second perspective. And she admitted that she always felt off about our relationship from the start, but she never wanted to judge my choices. That sent even more alarms off in my head, but when I asked him about it, he said, ""Yeah, it's normal for girls like you to feel like that about your first relationship. If you're trying to start an argument again, I'm not interested."" And I… stayed quiet, too.

Now, fast forward to last month, and he proposed. It wasn’t super romantic – we were on a weekend trip with some friends, and he just kind of did it over dinner. I was honestly surprised, but I said yes because… I don’t know, I thought this is what we both wanted? I was really excited and started talking about wedding plans, but as soon as I did, he started acting weird.

I brought up looking at venues, and he straight-up laughed. He said I was being “overly dramatic” and that there’s “no need to go overboard.” When I mentioned a guest list, he told me I was “jumping the gun” and even called me “clingy.” It stung, but I tried to brush it off. I thought maybe he just needed time to warm up to the idea, but every time I mention anything about the wedding, he just shuts me down or changes the subject.

Last week, I got emotional about it, and he actually said I have “anger issues” for getting so worked up. He even joked that maybe I should “cool it with the wedding planning” and think about “working on myself first.” I’m starting to feel like maybe he proposed because he felt pressured or like I’ve done something wrong by even talking about a future together.

I guess what really threw me was something he said the other night. I was talking about how I was thinking of inviting my cousin to help me look at dresses, and he just kind of laughed again and said, “Maybe you should make sure you don’t look too… desperate.” I asked him what he meant, and he told me I’m “trying too hard” to be a perfect fiancée. I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean, but it just made me feel awful.

I’m so confused. I keep wondering if I did something to make him think I forced him into this, or if I’m wrong for even wanting to plan a wedding in the first place. I’m starting to feel like I should just drop it all and let him handle it when he’s ready, but my family’s excited, and I am too.

I posted about this in another subreddit, and my advice was to run. I understand that people might see our relationship as ""toxic"" or even ""abusive,"" but... I'm scared, in a way. He is the one who always handled our finances, bills, etc. I barely finished college, and I don't have any work experience. I also hate being a burden on people, whether it’d be my family or my friends. It’s just… a really scary situation for me. I want our relationship to work out, I really do. But I’m starting to realize that we might not be the ""dream team"" I always wanted us to be. 

What do I tell him? 

TL;DR =
My Fiance feels like this is moving too fast, and I'm being overly dramatic. I think that he felt pressured into this engagement (Due to our Family's heavy, but not so heavy, Mormon beliefs), and I think he might be misunderstood. ",2024-11-11 15:47:02

It's easier if it's something he needs to do like work rather than just something he wants to do like a hobby. I get an intense feeling of rejection no matter how many times he tells me he loves me and how much he cares about me. After he leaves I usually have some kind of meltdown or anxiety attack where my brain is telling me he doesn't care about me anymore and he's never coming back. I believe the trigger of leaving stems from childhood as I used to quite frequently get flashbacks when watching someone leave of my father speeding off leaving me and my mum when I was 7 and of him leaving our house for the last time before he would take his own life when I was 11. 
I know this isn't a healthy way to have a relationship but I'm not sure what I can do to fix it.

I’m usually not a jealous person so I didn’t think much of it. On the new iPad I saw an insta alert from this ex because she follows him. My curiosity got the best of me and I checked the messages. He was at the very top and had messaged in the last 2 days. The chat is on vanish mode. 

I’m not sure where to go from here but we’re usually very open with each other and this feels like something she’s trying to keep a secret. I feel like I violated her privacy looking at her messages but now I can’t get over what I saw. 

Could use some advice.

Edit: thanks all for the advice. For the time being I’m going to sit tight and observe. I have pictures of what I found in case it goes ‘missing’. 

Edit 2: I found some nude pictures in her hidden library. Some had been sent to me before and others I had never seen. The ones I had not seen before were far more provacative than the ones she sent me in the past. Last night I told her she could go through my hidden library if there was anything she didn't want me to keep, she left them all.  A bit later I asked if she had anything cool in hers I hadn't seen and she didn't really answer. Almost acted like she didn't hear me.  

This morning I asked her about the vanish chat with her ex while we were walkikng the dogs.  She said he must have put that on and she didn't know how to turn it off.  This is potentially true as she isn't great with apps and tech in general, but I still feel like she could have asked him not to hide it. She said they rarely exchange messages but he messaged her recently sharing his halloween costume since he is a school teacher in Korea (we live in the US).  She acknowledged my feelings and didn't try to minimize them.  She said she's never stepped out of line and hopes I can believe her.  

After we got back she started packing for a work trip that she's leaving on.  Meanwhile I went down to air up the tires in the car and looked at the ipad again.  All of the hidden images were gone except for the ones she sent me in the past.  At this point I'm pretty confident something happened.  The deleting of the images sealed that notion for me.  I took pictures of the ipad last night and emailed them to myself.  I have all the information I need, now I just have to decide what to do with it.",2024-11-10 20:22:19
relationships,1gp02g4,Am I wasting my time in this marriage ?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp02g4/am_i_wasting_my_time_in_this_marriage/,8,"So me(M46) and my wife(F44) has been married for 25years. We move in together about 2 weeks after we met. Her father hated me from the start and her mother did not dislike me, but grew to love me over the years. We got married about a year after we moved in together, we had our first child within the first year of marriage. My firstborn was 8 months old when my wife admitted to me one night out of the blue that she had developed feelings for her boss at the time. I then Left my wife everything we had at that point and ghosted her. After about 6 months she tracked me down through my family(Due to the money I was send her through them) We chatted for about 2 months. Then she brought my first born to come visit me.  



One thing led to another and we ended up getting back together. We had another child 1 year after that.  We had a tough life getting back on to our feet and just as we started getting to a place where we could say we were stable, my wife started nagging to move back to the town where her family was. We gave up everything and moved back to her home town. 

Shortly after arriving back in her home town. I got a job again and we agreed she would be a house wife. About 6 months after we got back to her home town, her parents moved to the other side of the country(about 18 hours Drive or 2 hours flight). We stayed in her home town for another 3 years and then she started the whole thing about missing her parents(even though I sent her to go visit them for 2 months every Dec to Jan), so we ended up selling everything again and moving to the same city her parents stayed in. 



I got a job there and we started over again.  After some time in this new city, she started to become very daring with clothing and very clingy with her phone. Long story short, I caught her having steamy chats with one guy, lots of explicit photo was shared with him and allot steamy chat. When I confronted her, she denied it, I then showed her the evedince and she came clean. Lots of sob stories, promise not to do it again. I ended up forgiving her for this. But made it clear I will not forget it.



Fast forward some years and I start seeing the same changes as the first time. This time I left it and just monitored chats without her knowledge. Turns out she and one of my so called friends, was meeting up and having dates during the day when I was working.

 

She claims nothing happened except them kissing once in his car in a parking lot. But I do not believe her. Once again I confronted her. Lots of Sobbing and promises I made peace with it again and left it. The last time when  I caught her talking to other men and sharing steam chats and explicit photos, I told her I do not mind her doing it. But she must not hide it from me. Thus giving her free rain to do this. I even told her, if she want to be with another man. She can do this. Just do not hide it from me, Since I flt trust is important. She promissed not to do it anymore. Claiming she does not know what is wrong with her. 



Fast forward quite a few years of being faithful(at least I believe she was) and we have another child. Now the age difference between my youngest and second youngest is 18 years. 

One day I come into the house and randomly take her phone to make a call. Guess what I find her having steam chats again. I confront her and ask her why she deleted the old chats and how long this has been going on. At first she denied it, then I bluffed her and Told I could retrieve the chats from her phone backups. She came clean and once again made the promise not to do it again. So I stayed. 



Now fast forward 6 years, My wife suddenly found religion. Bearing in mind I am not an atheist, I am just not very religious. She is trying to get me to be more religious by subtly asking me to pray before we eat, Getting me to read Bible to my son.  Since I do not want to force my beliefs or lack there of on to her, I do this. 

Then she started complaining about my smoking(i have smoked since the day we met. She quite smoking when she fell pregnant with our last child) and demanded I do not smoke in our room. This never used to be a problem. We make a compromise that her (7) cats stays out the room and I would not smoke in the room. 

Now she is starting to become very prudish. What I mean by this, if I make steamy jokes with her, or ask her for sexy pics or try to chat to her explicitly she gets very annoyed and stops me dead in my tracks. The intimacy level has dropped to once maybe twice a month(It used to be 3 to 4 times a week). And when this happens it is always the same. If I try and spice it up, I am told no she has back pain, or a head ache, or .....



\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My question is. To me it feels like we are drifting apart and that maybe there maybe someone else. I mean if you look at the times between her lapsing, the time sort of fits. Problem is I have tried everything to try and talk to her about it. But every time I do there is sobs, and I get told she is sorry for what she has done to me, and she understand I would never trust her again, and … 

I then get pissed of and just tell her to leave it.  



Am I wasting my time staying and hoping that she will change back to the same fun loving person I fell in love with or should I accept this is the way it would be  going forward. 



Sorry for the long rant. Any help or advise is appreciated.

relationships,1gou23q,I’m not good enough,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gou23q/im_not_good_enough/,6,"As mentioned in the title, I (22M), feel like I’m not good enough in my relationship with my fiancé (23F). We’ve been together since May 2022. 

I don’t know why I feel this way because she always says how good I am to & for her, how lucky she is, etc, but I always have thoughts at the back of my mind that maybe that isn’t true. I try my best to do everything to make her happy, like fuck. Yesterday, I wanted to surprise her, so I got her shoes that she really wanted, flowers, neckless, press on nails despite the fact that I don’t have a job at the moment. There were loads of other things I wanted to get but time was super limited due to a tradition in the UK where stores close early on a Sunday for some reason..? But something just felt off. I’m scared to think that me and her lost that spark we once had. She didn’t come across as excited & as enthusiastic as she once was when me and her first started talking. I’m starting to believe that I am boring her & that maybe she deserves someone else that can treat her the way she wants to be treated. (I also realised that I’m probably going to contradict myself a lot here in this post).

It has been digging into my soul recently because I always compare myself to others. Whether it’s from those TikToks where X surprises Y with loads of things & they’re so happy, etc, or just seeing how people are. I also noticed a few things that have changed over the months that feeds even more into why I feel like I’m not good enough. (I keep repeating myself, I do apologise, it just hurts a lot).

I also know that this is a reach & I know I’m overthinking / overwhelming myself loads here, but what if someone else is giving her the needs she wants because she might think that i’m not trying to give it to her.. or that I’m not giving her enough? I know it’s such a reach & I’m not trying to imply anything, but I get scared. I have absolutely no family anymore due to no contact & as much as she says she will never leave me, I don’t know that. Someone can probably easily come across her & take her away from me because of how much of a better job they have at doing certain things. I’m not saying that’s going to happen, but It’s hard not thinking that when I feel like a disappointment & just a waste of space around her when she deserves so much more. 

I don’t know anymore. I just want her to be happy & I don’t want her to be with me if she feels as if i’m holding her back in any way. 

Does anyone else feel like this in their relationship? I’m looking for advice, maybe on how to overcome these emotions?

*TL;DR: I (22M) don’t feel like i’m doing a good job in my relationship with my fiancé (23F) & how I believe i’m not doing enough to satisfy her needs as much as I am trying to do everything in my power to meet them & it’s starting to drive me crazy.*",2024-11-11 14:56:50

",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp21se/i_28f_dont_know_if_i_should_marry_the_father_29m/,21,"throwaway account bc of personal details

I‘ve been going out with a man for the last couple months, we met about one year ago.  
we get along great. We have great sex.

well I got pregnant pretty unexpectedly. he proposed a couple days afterwards. The thing is, I do not feel like I know enough about him to marry him. I think I love him, but I’ve never been in love before. I’ve been single nearly my whole life, I slept with only about two or three men before him, my longest relationship was four months. I would have been ready to marry him after a year or two, just so I can be sure he won’t switch up on me, but life happened.

Although I am just starting my career, I am okay keeping this child and raising it by myself without any help from him. He is who I would choose as a sperm donor anyway. Attractive, tall, college educated, great personality, no family history of cancer etc etc (I am a physician)

We had many discussions on child rearing the past couple of weeks. I am in the army reserves but never deployed, he will be getting out of the airforce soon. I want to do more army stuff by volunteering, if I can. He says he is okay with this, and can look after my baby.

we have some things to work through in lifestyle etc, I like traveling more than him, where will we live, so many logistics etc . But he is a good roommate, doesn’t make me do his chores so I really appreciate that. I’ll know for sure he’s a good man if he helps me in labor.

my biggest concern with us marrying is that we will have a significant income disparity from next year. We used to make about the same. I got a massive raise in September. I will make a lot more than him. He is great about this, not insecure at all, but we‘ve all heard how men change when the baby is here.

I have this vision of my baby being at our wedding, it’s weird. Like a flower girl, or my son can walk me down the aisle. This solidifies I want to marry my boyfriend, but I am not sure when, or if I’m being stupid marrying a man less than a year after we went exclusive.

tldr; I‘m pregnant, baby daddy seems too good to be true. So much to figure out before the baby’s birth, I don’t think I can plan a wedding. I don’t know if I should marry him because I will soon make a lot more than him and this could cause him to hate or resent me. ",2024-11-11 20:20:27

We both communicated about the ""purpose"" of a future relationship between us, And it seemed that it was something ""concrete"" and long term, Take into account that this would be her first relationship, We are also virgins too (lol this could be kinda unnecessary but ykyk haha), So, Thats why we are taking it with its proper seriousness.

However, Due that shes a girl who is a really good student, and also career-focused, She mentioned that its probable for her to move to another city to study in june of the next year, I am also going to travel for 4 months to the US from May to September of the next year, But in my case, It is only temporary.

This is making me overthink a lot, I am already starting to fall in love with her, Our ""Knowing phase"" is going well, and we are calmly escalating our trust, But the fact that she will probably move away is making me feel like everything is just going to straight up end there, I already communicated this thought to her, And she told me that i shouldnt overthink, or project it too much, Hell, She even said that we arent even engaged yet so that is why i should not have to ""worry"" that much about it.

At first, She understood that if i wanted to leave everything there due to her possible decision, Then it could be ""understandable"" since she doesn't want to make me feel bad in the future, She has also thought a lot about the situation too, But i decided to keep everything as how it was already going, But even then, I still overthink about the future, I am really in love with her and i dont want to hop in a different relationship or straight breaking up with her, Remember that she has never stated about breaking up with me, or any related decision due to her studies, I am the one who is thinking about this.

What should i decide to do? And which advice could you give about my situation?

TL;DR: Im 18 and recently started talking to a 16-year-old girl you really like when we met, and after she asked for my number. After confessing our feelings, we both agreed to take things slowly and seriously, aiming for a long-term relationship. However, she may need to move to another city for college next June, and you’ll be away in the U.S. from May to September. This distance is causing you anxiety, even though she has reassured you to not worry prematurely. She’d understand if you wanted to end things, but you decided to keep going. Despite this, you’re still worried about the future and don’t want to lose her.",2024-11-11 13:30:22

My boyfriend & I have been dating a year & a half now and he told me that he’s not comfortable with coming to talk to me or trust me with certain things because he doesn’t like the way I think and I’m emotional,irrational and insecure. 
He says he’s not comfortable with coming to be and giving me honest feedback,he wants me to be a better woman for him. 

I understand I have some insecurities from past traumas or need to work on making decisions based on emotions. I just don’t know where to start or how to fix it. I want to be a better person in my relationship so we don’t have our problems anymore & don’t want my man to leave.  

I think also I let my insecurities come out sometimes because of certain things he told me from his past, with his ex and other females and makes me hard to believe someone can completely change and be 100% good and faithful because of what I’ve experienced & saw in the past with men, which was traumatizing. 
Also 80% of his friends are a bad influence & are cheaters & the rest are not. Also has a lot of female friends & some had history with. 
He doesn’t give me any reasons that he’s unfaithful or is a liar. But it makes me have my guard up. 

I think I’m being a little overprotective of myself & my heart which is making insecurities come out and I really don’t know how to fix it. 
And how do I change my way of thinking when I’ve been like this for so long.",2024-11-11 12:55:32

She comes from a very conservative family, small village (Eastern Europe), we are ethnically same. She has an abusive father but she left the village 4 years ago and now lives far from her family.  
I love her and she loves me as she says, but her actions talk the other way, at least that's how i see it.  
I am a type of person that wants to spend every important moment with the girl i love. But she is different on that, she was hiding me from her coworkers, she does not want her relatives to know about me (she just told her mother and brother). we just meet and have fun, explore new places, i try to make her days very special but she is not much into that, she is happy if we just cuddle and have in bed (she is a virgin).

This last one has really made me upset, it's her baptism ceremony in a few days and she does not even consider me around her on that day, she wants to do it all alone.  
I am going to talk her about that tomorrow because I feel she is disrespectful to me, I am serious about this relationship and i expect the same from her, My guess is that she is afraid if our relationship fails, her family and relatives will judge her, I am afraid the age difference just adds to all this. I am really worried about this, there are a lot of men out there who will want.

Resubmitted as I called my demented grandma a naughty word according to the bot. I am an androgynous queer person, 32 years old. Despite being in what appears to be a hetero relationship, as I present mostly femme and my husband is masc, everyone always figures out that I am gay anyways, so I don't bother hiding it. Even before the dyed hair and cuffed jeans, people were pegging me (lol) before I came out so I gave up on being in the closet entirely. My husband, 31, cis bisexual, and I have been married for 5 years, dating for 9. I have a visible disability, which will sadly be relevant in a minute. We were travelling with our toy poodle, who is well trained to just hang out whenever we go somewhere dog friendly. I told my husband if I'm having a tiny dog, then they will be polite. Also relevant, in a minute. 

This past week we were on a long road trip where we were crashing at various friend's houses on our way up to nowhere Wisconsin, where we were going to attend a mutual friend's wedding. My husband was in the bachelors party (he and the groom were closer than I and the groom), so we were attending the rehearsal dinner and the post-rehearsal hang out at the groom's parents. 

The road trip was one bungled up issue after another (finding bedbugs in the one hotel we were going to stay in, stray cat charged our poodle, just every day something went wrong), so I wanted to go home and skip the wedding. But my husband talked me down and I listened and decided I was going to look forward to having a good time. 

Well apparently the groom's father had other ideas. At the post-rehearsal hangout, we had been told we could bring our Poods (our poodle) to meet people. At one point, Poods is laying on my lap as he was trained to do, and the groom's father (who was very drunk at this point) gets up in my face and starts going off at me about I'm a bad dog owner, Poods obviously isn't socialized or trained, that it's my fault if something happens to him, etc etc. Just really weird off the wall stuff, that made zero sense. The other groomsman is also looking over like ""what is happening?"" As this goes round and round. I ask if he wants me to leave, he says no, but then begins the cycle again.  

It's not the first time some someone has yelled at me over something nonsensical, as my grandma had dementia (rest in peace you whacky sack of potatoes, love you). So that wasn't bothering me - however, I am not very tall (5'9"") or strong, and this drunk guy is leering over me screaming in my face, and I had just been talking about being openly queer - you get where I'm coming from I'm sure. After it becomes clear the groom's father can't be talked down (I kept offering solutions to try and calm him, I stayed chill and he just kept getting more riled up) the other groomsman left to grab the groom, who immediately walked between us and told his dad to leave. 

During the initial event my husband was next to me, and once he ""realized he was just yelling to yell at you"" was also trying to diffuse the situation. He said he ""Was trying to catch up and figure out the context."" I know logically he did the smart thing, but part of me keeps wondering what ""context"" was needed - the groom didn't have any context and still got right between us. Wasn't it enough to see me getting yelled at by a drunk dude in my face?

 After that everyone pretty much left, including my husband and I. While I held it all together while there, the second we were off the property I broke down crying in the car. All I wanted was to go home. But my husband talked me into staying for the ceremony at least, so we did and just avoided the grooms dad. 

I keep trying to move past it, and I've let him know I'm still hurt, but I don't know what to do. In the moment while I stood my ground, I also felt so alone and vulnerable, and not like I had my life partner at my side. I feel betrayed letting him talk me into staying for the wedding and wish we had never gone on the trip. 

I thought I could work past this on my own, but right when we got back, not even 24 hours later, he wanted to get intimate. And I just felt betrayed even more, as he knew how upset I had been, and when we had similar issues with me feeling safe around his family (who are mostly cut off now), I told him how difficult it was for me to want to get intimate when I didn't feel safe. I pointed this out to him and he feels awful, but I'm just so frustrated with him. He said he just wanted us to get back to normal, but I don't feel normal. 


How do I move past this? What can I do to regain trust that if things had continued to escalate that he would stand up for me when I can't stand up for myself? It's not like I wanted him to get physical but it took him so long to even try to help diffuse the situation and I didn't feel safe until the groom stepped in - and I feel like I should have felt safe having my husband right next to me. What do we do now? 

TL;Dr - Drunk guy got in my face yelling obsuridites at me, my husband ""waited to figure out the context"" before assisting, I am feeling upset that he didn't do more to help me feel safe. How do we rebuild trust and move forward? ",2024-11-11 23:48:33

I grew up in a household where if my dad ever got angry something very bad would end up going down so I have developed a panic disorder and when my boyfriend gets extremely upset it’s not unheard of for him to take it out on me a little by saying hurtful things or he would act out physically on things around him like he would kick his phone into the wall or scream in my face. This triggers me and leads me into a panic attack most the time and I would break down and tell him what hurt me and it wouldn’t go well. I learned if he does something to scare me or says something very hurtful I should just keep my mouth shut and distance myself or else he would lose all empathy for me and continue to be hurtful and aggressive during my panic episodes. This is a big toll on me mentally especially since I live with him and sometimes it’s hard to deal with day to day life with my level of anxiety. So I decided to confide in my best friend of around 9 years about our problems just to get it off my chest and feel some sort of support while I continue to try to make it work. Well yesterday my boyfriend eavesdropped into my conversation regarding what state I would be in if me and him wouldn’t work out and I assured my friend I would be okay and try to move on and focus more on loving myself. He didn’t take this well and stated I shouldn’t be talking to her about me and his business. It’s hard to keep all of the stress and turmoil inside and my best friend truly takes a weight off my shoulders when speaking to her. I feel like I should have someone to talk to and I shouldn’t be spied on and scolded for getting advice and comfort from a third party. Should I not be open about my relationship with my close friend? 

TLDR; My boyfriend(M20) and I(F18) live together and our relationship problems seem to get worse and worse. My boyfriend has bad anger issues which trigger my panic attacks and it’s exhausting for me daily to sit through his outbursts and attempt to compress my emotions for him. I decided to open up about my struggles to my childhood friend of 9 years and my boyfriend ease-dropped on us and scolded me for “letting other people in our business” although it’s taking a toll on me emotionally.

relationships,1gp33uf,"[24F/24M] Boyfriend might think I stopped seeing my ex-FWB earlier than I actually did, how to clarify with him? ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gp33uf/24f24m_boyfriend_might_think_i_stopped_seeing_my/,25,"Hey Reddit,

I am seeking advice on how to have a clarifying conversation with my boyfriend about our exclusivity timeline. I am of an anxious disposition and struggle with understanding what is and isn't private and worth sharing. I have previously been in an abusive relationship where I was actively punished for my sexual past, which has made discussing sex with lovers very taboo. I am seeking outside opinion to best understand how to navigate this. 

When my partner and I met a few years ago, I had just begun exploring open relationships. I let him know I was interested in exploring that model. He agreed to it. I also made it relatively clear that given our circumstances (he was moving far away permanently), a serious relationship wouldn't really be possible.

We decided to take a trip together to see each other one last time before he left (it is worth noting he wasn't even living in my city at the time and was just briefly visiting, which is when we met). I imagined that what we would have would be a nice, short fling. 

During the trip, I fell in love and realized that 1. I didn't want to do an open relationship with him/that that model didn't suit me, 2. That I wanted to have a long distance relationship with him.  I initiated both conversations (the first that I didn't want to pursue an open relationship with him and only wanted to see him, the second, that I was willing to have a long distance relationship with him and would figure out a way on my end to close the gap). 

At the time, I did not disclose I was seeing other people, partially out of clumsiness, thinking that saying I was interested in (and actively exploring) open relationships was enough, and also because when my partner and I met, he was moving permanently on the other end of the country, and I didn't imagine we would have a future. The entirety of my past relationships had been long distance and I wasn't interested in having another long distance long term relationship. 

Up until the moment we had these conversations, I was still actively involved with my FWB at the time. Again, I have to reiterate that I had absolutely no vision of a future with my boyfriend until we went on that trip - I imagined I was going to come back to my life in my city and continue on with what I had left there. I saw my ex-FWB one last time shortly before the trip and started realizing that this whole open relationship model maybe wasn't for me as I couldn't stop thinking about my to-be-boyfriend and that I was starting to like my FWB less and less but I continued seeing him, to ensure some form of stability/security. 

I was in a period of big change and was maximizing stability in my life (a fact brought to my attention by my therapist). It's worth noting that I have a fairly extensive history of trauma and often feel unsafe - I was unaware at the time that I was operating under this need for stability and how deeply out of touch I was with what I actually wanted. I was acting out of automatism and obligation. That entire part of my life feels very violating in some ways. 

It is worth noting that the first thing I did upon coming home from that trip was letting my FWB know we couldn't continue on with the benefits. I tried to be friends with him (which I have historically done with other FWB) but when that failed, I let it be. In other words, from the moment my boyfriend and I committed to exclusivity and then having a relationship (against all odds), I took all necessary measures in my life to align my life circumstances with this new reality. 

What I feel at grips with today is the following: a few months ago, my partner and I discussed exclusivity and I let him know that at the time when we first met, I was still seeing my ex-FWB and that I cut things off when I came back from the trip we had taken. I had felt unsure about sharing this in the past (viewing this as past, private info from before we were officially together). My partner was understandably hurt by this new information but has moved on for the most part, though it remains a bit of a sore spot. 

Now, to my dilemma: I know now that my partner fell hard and fast for me. On my end, it took us travelling together to 1. Really fall in love, and 2. Open up to the idea of a long term, long distance, exclusive relationship. I am concerned that he is projecting some of his feelings onto me and that he thinks I saw my ex-FWB less and less as the trip approached/had perhaps stopped a few weeks prior, when in truth, I continued seeing him at a similar frequency until the trip, and only when we decided to make our relationship a possibility, took all necessary measures in my private life to change this. 

In short, I'm concerned that he thinks I was less involved with my FWB during that initial time than I actually was. I don't know how to clarify this info without hurting his feelings. I don't even know if I should or if he already has all info he needs to have in hand (i.e. I was still seeing my ex-FWB when we met, I wanted an open relationship, I didn't want to do long distance --> I discovered open relationships didn't work for me, I initiated exclusivity and relationship talks, I broke things off with my ex-FWB as soon as I came back home). 

How to broach this topic with him?

TLDR: was still seeing my ex-FWB when I first met my BF and was interested in open relationships, which I let my to be boyfriend know. Future BF and I weren't meant to have a future and become a thing as he was moving away, but here we are now. I think my BF thinks I stopped seeing my ex-FWB earlier than I actually did in our period of pre-exclusivity. How do I clarify this? Do I need to?

relationships,1goztgx,My boyfriend hasn’t let me meet his friends or invited me to anything for 2 years,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goztgx/my_boyfriend_hasnt_let_me_meet_his_friends_or/,42,"I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for 2 years and we moved cross country not long ago. I know that may seem drastic but we’ve dated on and off for 4 years. I’ll try to keep this short, I’m just really looking for advice here. Maybe some words of encouragement?

TLDR; my boyfriend has not invited me to anything the last two years of our relationship except for this current Thanksgiving. He has been around my friends for our entire relationship.

Before we moved, he ditched me several times and even after moving he still did. I chalked it up to, “he just wants to spend time with his friends before he moves 1300 miles away,” and didn’t let it bother me much. Even though he would straight up ditch plans we already had and only made time for me once-twice a week as opposed to the 5-6 days a week with his friends. He moved 2 months before I did because I just wanted to make sure this is what we both wanted and to give myself extra time to prepare. 

Once I got here, he went home for 7 days without me and was super shady about it. He didn’t even tell me he bought the flight until like a week or two out from it happening and didn’t think to invite me or anything which really bothered me because he could have done that while I was still home. We moved here for his job, I only moved here for him so it just felt selfish on his part because I didn’t know anyone here and it was really lonely and made me question why the hell I moved here in the first place. 

From that point on, he would invite me to things to uninvite me the day of or day before. Go as far as to tell me he won’t invite me to anything because it’ll be, “awkward.” Which, he’s since clarified he meant that he’s nervous his friends will embarrass him. I feel like I should note that he’s met all of my friends, gone on trips with us, they’ve stayed at our place, and they are even on each others social medias. He’s officially friends with my friends and I’m totally left out of his life. 

Fast forward to this past August, his friends came the week of my birthday. I just KNEW he would ditch me. Lo and behold, he went out and third wheeled with his best friend and best friends wife on my 25th birthday so I just went out with a friend I know here. Was I invited to his friend dinner? Nope. 😂 that was a BIZZARE day to say the least and I’m not even friends with the girl I went out with anymore because she stole something from me that night. In October, those friends got married an hour away from our place as a destination wedding. Was I invited? Nope. (which I get it, it’s their special day. it’s just the cherry on top of never being invited to anything in his life and he had a whole weekend of fun festivities with his friends which I was not apart of and it sucks because if the roles were reversed, OF COURSE he’d be invited). 

I have a wedding coming up that I’m a bridesmaid for and I requested a plus one to bring him. (I have since removed the plus one though and I know that’s petty but, it is what it is). I am going to his parents house for Thanksgiving (he asked me after he told me that his friends were coming for my birthday and we wouldn’t be hanging out for it which really felt like a pitty invite). He literally said, “while we’re on the topic of special days, why don’t you come home with me for Thanksgiving?” 🙃 I have a ton of anxiety surrounding it because of everything that’s happened. I told him I would leave and stay with my best friend for two of those days so he could see his friends. 🙃 (please don’t drag me for this). I just feel like I am at a loss. 

A lot of resentment has built up and I’m not sure how to handle the feelings. 

Yes, I have thought about leaving and have made arrangements to do so multiple times. It’s just not as easy as it is to say “just leave him.” I am not perfect either. I understand wholeheartedly that I haven’t done anything even remotely close to as messed up as some of the things he’s done. Our discussions now sound like him saying, “I know all of the problems in our relationship are caused by me. I hate that I make you feel that way.” 

I am extremely tired of hearing that and it makes me think, why am I still here? Then, I’ll tell him that I want to leave and our relationship sucks and this crap really hurts me. Then he’ll start hyperventilating crying. It’s like a circle we go around and around in for the past year. 

He told me that he’s going to start therapy and my therapist is going to send me a list of therapists with no waitlists so that he can start. He said he wants to go to learn how to talk without shutting down. I’m not sure how to navigate the friend situation. I feel like that’s more of a waiting game. 

I see effort on his part and see small efforts over time and I think that’s what keeps me here. 

(please no theorizing. no he is not secretly married, no he doesn’t have a secret family elsewhere, no he doesn’t have another girlfriend. yes, i am his profile picture on all social media platforms. his friends do know about me, they just haven’t met me. sure, he could be cheating. but i want to stick at the topic at hand here and not be bombarded with a bunch of theories to spiral about for the next month).",2024-11-11 18:50:28
relationships,1gog40r,I hate my brother and i don't know how to stop,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gog40r/i_hate_my_brother_and_i_dont_know_how_to_stop/,5,"English is not my first language, if i cause confusion because of it, please tell me so i can fix it. TRIGGER warning for CA.

Nowadays, my brother is 19 years old. I'm a 20 years old male. We suffered with the classic ""Golden child, loser child"" situation. I can say my mom CLEARLY had favoritism, was borderline cruel, unreasonable and egocentric, but i cannot tell if she has any mental issues as she was never - or even tried to be - diagnosed with something.

I don't remember my first years of life very well, but i can tell that it was probably the most peaceful moments of my life. I stayed with my grandma until i was four, due to my mom only leaving me there to adress ""issues"". I honestly never knew what those issues were. My quite happy life ended the moment my mother actually came back and made me move out to live with her.

She made me do chores around the house - it was very light at the start, but as months progressed it started to take a toll on me as they started to become progressively hard for a small boy to do. I didn't know how to do it? I was beaten. Asked her how to do it? Beaten. Tried to do it anyways and didn't do it right? Beaten and banned from playing with my toys... which weren't many, to be honest. But they were all i had. I couldn't watch TV, i couldn't read anything that wasn't a bible (with four years old, i could barely read children's texts... if i tried to, for example, read comics, i was also punished), nothing.

But my brother could watch the TV everytime and anytime he wanted. He had many, many toys. Could read anything and often did so in front of me. He was never punished severely, not even if he did something wrong, at max my mother banned him from playing for some hours. She showered him with praises while anything i did was a reason for her to berate me. Even so, i loved him. As an introverted awkward kid, i still saw them as the only people that i truly could count with.

This love disappeared by the time we were 6-7. And that's because, when comprehending that no matter what he did he would never get truly punished, he started to simply do any bad thing on his way and turning the blame on me. Like breaking things, getting the house dirty, just generally doing things that my mom strictly prohibited - no matter how much i cried and swore on my life i was innocent, i would be beaten. It reached to a point that all my love turned into full hatred, i felt utterly betrayed, like no one loved me, like everyone wanted to hurt me

It went on for years, only stopping when we were 14-15. He drank one of our mom's beer can, and of course, blamed me when she found out. This time, i had a very dangerous panic attack, couldn't breath and passed out for the first time. Passed a night on the hospital. It seems he got guilty, as he started to actually tell the truth about anything he did. As expected, my mother still didn't do much to actually punish him even if he did so.

Surprisingly he actually started to get closer to me after this incident, even becoming gentle. But i just couldn't. I can't. I really want to love him again, i really tried to understand his point of view and the way our mother's influence probably made him do all those things with me, how the fact that she was the ""perfect mother"" to him still blinds him to see her true colors. But i can't. I know it sounds cheesy, but it is like a wall - everytime i try to have some quality time with him it feels like i remember all those years and a feeling of utter anger flutters inside of me until i can't even stand seeing his face anymore. 

Right now, i'm living with my grandma as she needs support, but both my brother and mom always try to contact me. I always turn my mom down instantly, and sometimes my brother messages me saying that she changed, that i should give her a chance, that i'm being petty and unsensitive. Believe me, i really tried to reconnect with her. But the moment she opened her mouth to talk shit about me like she ALWAYS did, i gave up easily.

But i didn't give up on my brother yet. I've been doing therapy for one year and a half and i'm solving my low self-esteem and paranoid/lack of trust in other people issues quite well, but this wall is still something hard to overcome. If anyone that experienced this or just has any tip to overcome this feeling, please do tell me. Sorry for such a long text.

TL;DR: Mother physically abused me for years while treating my brother, who took advantage of her distaste for me and now is trying to be nice with me again, as her golden child.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TLLIHSAwb7

Update: Hello again it's been a couple months and there were a good amount of people wanting an update so I'll try my best. But before I start I wanna say thank you to everyone a lot of the comments helped me. 

So after I made my last post we had a talk and we (23m and 22f) decided to separate and try therapy. It went good for a little bit but after a while I realized that she wasn't going to change so I asked for a divorce. That part was pretty rough. She didn't try to stop me and agreed that it wouldn't work anymore. The divorce went as smooth as could be I guess, she kept the house and a good amount of our stuff. Hardest part was her keeping our dogs. But thankfully all of my friends from work helped me along even when it sucked the most. It's been a couple months now since it's been finalized and I've kind of just been vibing. Not to sure but anyways that's all I've got. I've been trying to make an update but really wasn't sure what to put so this'll do.

Recently, I found messages on his phone where he was sexting multiple girls on Instagram. One of them was a girl he previously had a thing with, and he texted her saying he remembered how good it was to have sex with her. There were also messages to other girls where he discussed sexual topics or reacted to their stories.

When I confronted him, he said he was very sorry, and begged for a second chance. It’s true that we haven’t had sex for a couple of weeks. I’ve been stressed due to university and dealing with a UTI, while he’s been under pressure because of his father’s medical issues.

Are these valid reasons for him to have sexted other women? Should I give him another chance?

It was going really well at first, only slight issue being that she is best friends with a guy (24 M) who she is in constant contact with, literally texting 24/7 and facetiming each other every day. She actually sat on some of our early dates regularly pulling out her phone to chat to him. I gave her the benefit of the doubt at the time as despite this she was really nice and fun, and we were still having a great time.

After a few weeks I did call her out on it and she basically apologised explaining that Matt has been her best friend for 9 years and they are extremely close, and then said if it upset me she would cut contact during our dates.

I appreciated this and the next month or so went well. Anyway, in August she introduced me to some of her girl friends, and one of them asked how I was getting on with Matt. I replied I hadn't met him yet, and the girl went on to tell me that he was actually her ex bf.

Apparently they actually were best friends for years, but last year they started dating each other and the relationship lasted for 10 months. They broke up in January of this year as they mutually decided they worked better as friends.

I was obviously shocked and kind of embarrassed to find this out like this, so later that day I took it up with my gf. She confirmed everything as true and went on to say that the romantic side of their relationship was over and that I had nothing to worry about. Explaining that he was her oldest friend and they had been through a lot together. She admitted she was going to tell me at some point but didn't know how to break it.

After a long chat in which she told me she dosen't think she could live without him, I agreed to keep going with the relationship as long as she at least limited contact with him some more and only hung out with him when other friends are around. She agreed and that was that.

Over the next two months she did as she said, and we have grown much closer. However, the past few weeks she seems to be back talking to him like she used to, and has been hanging out with him (in a group) multiple times a week. This week for example she was with him Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evening.

It's especially frustrating as I live an hour away from her and all her pals, who live in the same town. Also because of the distance and our schedules not lining up, I only get to see her once a week. She usually stays over at mine on a Friday night and then spend our Saturdays together. So really he see's her more than me and I'm always wondering what is going on down there 6 days of the week.

The whole situation is just so annoying as it is my first proper relationship after wanting one for so long. I've talked to some of their mutual friends about what to do and have basically been told ""Idk Matt has always been her number 1 and she would probs choose the friendship over any relationship"". So it's basically up to me to trust them both or lose my gf.

I've still not met him btw. She keeps saying we need to figure out a time for the two of us to meet to calm any nerves, but it hasn't lined up yet.

So just looking for any advise on how to handle this? I'm so annoyed I've been dragged into the middle of a strange situation

Tldr - My girlfriend just recently dated her long-term guy friend and wants to continue the friendship even though she is now dating me. What is the best way forward here?",2024-11-11 15:09:02
relationships,1govudd,How can I trust my (f33) ex bf (m55) will change and learn from his mistakes if we get back together? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1govudd/how_can_i_trust_my_f33_ex_bf_m55_will_change_and/,23,"I (f33) am wondering if I should get back with my ex bf (55m). He dumped me because of my emotional “outbursts” when I get would get randomly upset because of my mental health problems. We were together for 10 months.

We started seeing each other again and he said he felt like he was too hasty and wants to get back together. I am in a much better place now mentally, but I said to him that there were a lot of things in our relationship I wasn’t happy about. I wrote him a very long letter with all the stuff below in it, and we are going to discuss this on Friday. 

We didn’t have great communication. I like to just talk about things calmly and openly, but he often got very defensive and woouldnt listen. He did get much better at this towards the end, and actually initiated some conversations after we’d had an argument. 

He also was really bad at apologizing and taking ownership of his side of things. I could tell he was sorry sometimes but he would never come back to me and say sorry, I wasn’t listening, or sorry, I got wound up. He also refuses to consider that he might have issues with relationships and how to make them last. He has had loads of ex girlfriends and the longest one was for 8 years, so apparently he does know how to do it. He doesn’t seem to be comfortable with exploring his issues and admitting that he isn’t perfect. When I said to him there were a lot of things I wanted to discuss before we got back together, he said “well I’m the one that dumped you, I’ve got great mental health” or something like that. 

I’m not perfect either, I am terrified of being in a relationship, and I was definitely toxic etx when I was with him in lots of ways, especially when I was very depressed in the beginning after being made redundant. But I try really hard to say sorry and be aware of my problems and self reflect, as I know this is very important. 

I also worry that he can’t handle big emotions and he wasn’t really supportive or understanding when I was really depressed, becuase he has never experienced depression or anxiety (or so he says). I know it can be really hard supporting someone when they are depressed, but I have felt like I’ve got this support from elsewhere from people who are good at supporting others and are understanding and non judgmental. I don’t know if he’s capable of being that person for me.

Whenever i talk to anyone about this, they all say he sounds really immature. I have told him we should have couples councelling if we do get back together so I know he has taken it all on board. 

We really get on well and have a great time together, but I don’t know if he is ever going to be what I need. I don’t know if I can trust him to be a grownup and be able to have a healthy relationship and take ownership of his issues and explore them, rather than just being like NO IM FINE, I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. 

TLDR: My (f33) ex bf (m55) dumped me because of various reasons such as my mental health. He now wants to get back together but I am not happy with how emotionally immature he could be. Should I give him another chance? 


EDIT: if on Friday when I talk to him about all of this, he fully admits he has these problems and he’s willing to change, and he is sorry, should I believe him and give him another chance? I feel like I should make it a condition that he has therapy. People can change, but they have to be willing to, which is the issue here. My dad changed a lot between the ages of 60 and 84, he became a much better dad.

1. he got really upset over a picture that i posted with 2 of my friends because the male friend was standing ""too close"" to me. he was standing an appropriate picture length. and then later, he made me delete it from my instagram because he didnt like that 
2. he got really insecure over a friend of mine and made me unfollow him from all social media. he also hacked into my instagram and retrieved deleted texts between us because ""if i didnt do anything wrong, i have nothing to worry about"" 
3. there is an older dude that i am good friends with from a former internship that i did, and my boyf doesnt like the fact that i talk to him. he got really weirdly happy when the older dude lost his job. 
4. he hooked up w a girl during the time we were broken up. i also had a thing with a guy. but he acts like what i did was cheating because i deliberately did it while i was sober, but what he did was fine because he was drunk. WE WERE BROKEN UP FFS 
5. he made me get rid of two of my closest male best friends because well i was close to them. 
6. he makes me remove the pictures of myself that i have posted even though they are not explicit because ""they should only be for his eyes""

this is just a few of the things that have happened over the past 3 years. there is definitely more to this.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has shown some interesting behaviours, like making me delete photos, unfollow male friends, hacking into my social media, and getting upset about my friendships with other men. Even though we both dated others during our breakup, he treats my actions as worse than his own. He also insists I keep my social media pictures limited, saying they should be “only for his eyes.” Are these red flags enough for me to end this relationship?

I (M38) have been with my girlfriend (F37) for a year now. We are very compatible and love each other, and so far, we haven’t had any major issues. Though recently I’ve noticed something that I’m not comfortable with.

She has a best friend (F37) whom she’s been very close to for the past 15 years. Early in our relationship, she told me about this friendship - how much they love and care for each other. Her best friend lives in another country now. As our relationship has progressed I’ve started noticing things that make me uncomfortable and feel like they may root back to something deeper.

They’ve been involved in a few threesomes (two of them with a man) together - the last one occurring about six months before we started dating. During these experiences they’ve gone down on each other and ""played"" with one another. They also used to kiss each other on the lips as a “greeting game” when they were younger for years. They had been playing with each other's bodies in the back of the car multiple times. At first, I accepted this as part of her past exploration.

A few months into our relationship I realized they exchange nudes with each other. I told my girlfriend that I’m not comfortable with this—even if it’s with another woman who’s her best friend. I need exclusivity here. She agreed and stopped sharing nudes.

Later, I noticed other things that bothered me. Her best friend sometimes tells her how much she misses her ""taste"" or the sex they had together. They exchange clothes to keep each other’s scent close. These actions started forming a picture in my mind that felt wrong. Or when her best friend has a new friend she express some jealousy. 

The last straw was discovering that they have some kind of pact. Her best friend suggested that she would ""marry"" my girlfriend if my girlfriend couldn’t move to her country (my girlfriend and I are planning to move to another country together).

I wasn’t happy with this. I told her that all these things make their relationship seem romantic to me, and the fact that her best friend is a woman doesn’t change that. I asked, ""How can you even think about this wedding and moving without me? Is this a joke you guys play?"" She replied, ""No, it’s not a joke; it’s real. She makes me happy. But it has nothing to do with my relationship with you. I wouldn’t move anywhere without you, and this doesn’t overlap with my love for you—it’s just something between the two of us."" She insists they’ve never wanted to be partners and have always supported each other in their romantic relationships.

My girlfriend has a slight romantic tendency toward women and has had a few such experiences in the past (which I’m fine with), but it adds to this picture, as it feels like she’s acting on those tendencies here. I also pointed out a few instances where I felt she prioritized her best friend over me in matters exclusive to our relationship—like decisions about where to live and how to get there.

Another example was when they were planning a trip to catch up. I couldn’t join the trip for personal reasons, but her best friend joked, ""It’s okay, we’ll find someone for you like last time."" When my girlfriend said no, explaining she was in a relationship, her best friend suggested, ""Well, you can be with my brother during the trip!"". I found this unsettling and out of place for a friendship.

Despite all this, my girlfriend insists that their roles are completely separate. She believes this relationship doesn’t overlap with my place in her life. But my gut feeling tells me otherwise—that this dynamic does encroach on our relationship in some way.

 How should I navigate through this? To me that's a space that can't be shared.

I (36/F) have been noticing that my boyfriend (34/M) has become increasingly distant over the last couple of months. We've known each other as acquaintances for 6 years, got together 5.5 months ago, and have been taking things quite slow (by mutual agreement). We had quite a short honeymoon period, but things were wonderful for the first 2.5 months. Sunshine, daisies, honestly the happiest I've been in years. We were both making a lot of time for each other, hanging out 1-2 times a week both alone and with our mutual group of friends, and he was regularly staying at my place. However, around the 3 month point, it seemed to me that he was losing interest/making less effort.

Increasingly, I felt like it was always me making the effort to communicate and organise meetings. There have been some issues with communication from the start: he's never been great at replying to texts promptly. According to friends this is a universal issue, but I did bring it up in the early days. I've had bad experiences in the past with both friendships and relationships where I've been ghosted, and I told him that when he sometimes takes 24+ hours to reply to a simple text, it sets my insecurities off. Unfortunately this didn't resolve the issue, and indeed it has become worse - often it's not 24 hours, it's 48-72.

I also feel like I've become less of a priority for him. In the early days he was actually bailing on plans with friends to spend time with me, which is not something I'd ask him to continue doing, but in the last two months he's also bailed on plans with me on more than one occasion. He's become more likely to turn me down when I suggest social plans, and overall I've found it much harder to organise to spend time with him. We don't live far from each other (25 mins drive/15 mins on the train) and share a social circle, in my town, but there have been periods recently when we've gone 2+ weeks without seeing each other because he's bailed on something or not seemed interested in meeting up.

The upshot of all of this is that the last time we spent any significant time alone together or had the opportunity for an in-person conversation was *six weeks ago*. Two weeks after that, he bailed on plans at the last minute. A week later, we went to a local event together but he didn't stay the night with me because I was going on holiday the next day. I had a week away, he turned down a social event a few days after I got back, then I saw him last weekend (with friends). I suggested that he came out with me and our mutual group of friends this weekend, but he turned that down on account of the fact that he had a busy day the next day.

I've not had an easy couple of months. My mum passed away six weeks ago after a long illness. I've been her carer for the last couple of years and it's been the end of a hugely stressful, traumatic period in my life. I'm now living alone (previously she lived with me) and it's been a very isolated, lonely, strange six weeks. I have a wonderful supportive circle of friends, I'm used to looking after myself and coping alone, I'm generally alright, but I won't lie... it would have been nice to have some more support from him. But there hasn't been much. He spent the day/night with me the day after she died, he's asked me how I am a couple of times, but otherwise... I don't know, as I said earlier, it feels like I haven't been a priority. I've had more support/concern from friends. I've had to be very strong, alone, a lot.

I know what you're going to say at this point. Wow - this guy is not pulling his weight. Either I need to be firm with him and state some needs, see if he follows through, or gtfo.

There is an explanation, I think. He suffers badly from seasonal depression and he's been very low for the last month or two. The weather here in the UK has been particularly grim and grey as well, it's even getting to me. When I saw him last weekend, I asked him how he was (pretty low) and reminded him that he could talk to me, that I cared, and that he didn't have to feel like shit alone. He hasn't taken me up on that, and I've barely heard from him over the last week. Communicating has been like getting blood out of a stone.

A lot of this change in behaviour could certainly be explained by depression. He's not at a great stage in his own life - he's unemployed currently and feeling quite purposeless, his housing situation is a little unstable. None of that really lends itself to health, happiness, or energy to give to a relationship. He is making an effort to look after himself and maintain a healthy routine, but is clearly struggling a bit.

Which is why I'm a bit reticent to make any demands of him. I really do care about this person. I have a pretty high bar for relationships and this is the first time in a decade I've been in a serious relationship - I simply haven't found someone I give this much of a damn about. I'm happy to prioritise him over myself, and the last thing I want is to come in heavy, demand attention, and push him away. On balance, the relationship is still having more of a positive than negative effect on my life. But I won't lie: I'm running on fumes. There's only so long I can sustain myself on the *idea* of being in a relationship, and this situation is starting to bring me down. I've started to feel resentful. I've been stopping myself from thinking about him, stopping myself from having any happy feelings about us, just to protect myself in case everything is about to go south. That's pretty sad, innit. Just a gram of serotonin please? Just a crumb?

What should I do? What would you do in this situation? I'm going to try and organise some time alone with him (I've *been* trying, but last weekend he turned down the offer to stay at my place after an event with friends, so we didn't get any time to ourselves). I'd really like to tell him that I'm not satisfied, I'm not feeling secure, that I'm not even certain he even wants to *be with me* any more, but I honestly don't think he's got the bandwidth for that kind of conversation at the moment. Is there anything I can do, other than stick it out and hope that things improve when Spring arrives?

Any advice would be hot, thanks.

**TL;DR** \- after a wonderful start to this 5.5 month relationship, 34/M boyfriend has become increasingly distant and hard to communicate with/make plans with. I (36/F) am starting to feel lonely, insecure, resentful and uncertain about the status of the relationship. He suffers from seasonal depression and is very low at the moment so I'm reticent to make any demands of him. Should I state my needs and ask for a bit more effort from him? Or stick it out and hope he pulls his shit together/approach these issues at a better time?",2024-11-11 06:32:52

",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goou2t/am_little_confused_on_how_to_react_on_my_close/,12,"we've (both of us are 19 (f) and 20(m) respectively) been in long distance relationship for about an year, i know him for like 4 years now but got into relationship with him last year, he lives in different city right now. both of us are pretty secure and comfortable, we communicate about every possible things. we talk regularly too. it's a healthy relationship so far to sum up. but today i felt bit not at ease when i got to know my boyfriend and my close friend met up, and i got to know about it later that evening. and not beforehand from either of them. idk if i am thinking too much or it's actually alright (to tell you about the girl, we've been GREAT friends for like 7 years now but for past one year ever since both of us got in relationships, we are not really that ""great"" friends anymore due to some internal issues, some problems happened, but we still have more or less a good bond), my boyfriend mentioned about him willing to meet her cuz they are in same city and he wants to be friends with my friends once before as well, but i clearly said a no cuz i wanted them to meet via me cuz she is my friend and he should get to meet her as his girlfriend's friend. and not someone who is directly linked to him. idk if that makes sense. (too controlling? maybe). so i disagreed on the idea of them meeting up that too in a city i dont currently live in. i normally never had any problem with him meeting up with other females, i've never really cared and was all fine with them. but because she is my friend first. i know her better. it concerns me a little but. (yeah, maybe i am making a big deal out of it. ) i mean yes, they informed me (but later on), yes they talked a lot (am not yet aware of the conversation), they'll tell me about the conversation if i ask them to (but i feel they should've told me by themselves, and not when I ASK them to) also the fact, i haven't talked to anyone related to him, NEVER, he doesn't really have much friends on his side, and a few which he have, they are not aware of us. but him on the other hands know every person in my life. i have given too much of freedom to him to talk to people related to me. in beginning i never found it problematic, but these days i am not really that comfortable with him talking to everyone. my cousins, my bestfriends. my close ones.

i would love to get some views on it, am little confused on how to react, i haven't said anything in this regards yet. haven't raised the topic infront of anyone of them yet thinking it might create unwanted problems and this might affect our relations with each other. need some advice.

TL;DR : my boyfriend and my closefriend met up today (they know each other via me and have no direct friendship link), without telling me beforehand. they did tell me after they've met though but i really was not comfortable with the idea of them meeting for the first time that too in my absence. both of them are close to me and i have good bond with them. but i feel like they should've met for the first time in my presence, or atleast inform me/ ask me BEFORE they meet each other.",2024-11-11 10:01:29

Is this a sign I should back out lmao cuz--

So I (24F) am in this talking stage with this girl (25F). In the beginning of the talking stage a month ago she replied like every 10 minutes to an hour or so, now she sometimes forget to reply to me for the whole day even though she's active in socials.

I voiced out my concerns saying ""I understand if you want alone time, cuz I also need mine. But I'd appreciate it if you tell me beforehand, and not leave me hanging. Cuz I feel hurt when I see you post on IG and not reply to me""

And she said something along like ""thank you for voicing out your needs, I do see a point there. But I'm not emotionally invested yet so I can't provude the commitment you want. Sorry if my honesty hurts""

I told her it's fine and I'll match her energy.

Honestly, that stung. The conflict is resolved but that really got me thinking. Do I want to be in a relationship with someone who doesnt want to do a simple thing for me to not make me overthink?

Honestly I need advice!! She's really nice and mature, but her reply got me feeling sad. Do I stick to her or just cut it off before I get more emotionally invested?

TL:DR should I back out after she told basically told me that she wont make effort to reply to my chats?

He went on a trip with his friends abroad. He followed people but one person stood out to me. It was a girl from the club that he met that had liked all his posts.. when he got back we had a little argument and he deleted her. (At the beginning of our relationship we have BOTH agreed to not add people from the club, we have established this boundary before). He said and I quote “so what if she’s into me I’m not into her you’re overreacting”. Months later I was suggested that girls username on Snapchat where I found out he had her on Snapchat too. We had another argument where I was stressing because what was the need to add someone over two different social media apps? He says they never texted except when he thanked her for helping him and his friends out. (Also he deleted her from snap when I found out). Why would there be a need for him to keep in touch with her? I found out that when he was on that trip they were “friendly” but he said he didn’t cheat. He also told me that this girl helped them into clubs so that’s why he was “friends with her in the first place” but none of his friends had her added? 

It’s been 10 months since that trip and 6 months since I found out he still had her on snap. I can’t get over it. I don’t really think I can get over the fact that he was letting someone be interested in him and he was flirting with her? I’m just scared to throw away a relationship with someone I’m so comfortable with over something people would deem as “not cheating”. I’m driving myself crazy. It has made me so insecure and feel like I’m disrespecting myself by staying with a man that showed interest in someone else that way (he knows this is an obvious boundary that he would HATE for me to do as well). When I used to try to bring up how hurt I am he’d turn it into a fight to the point that I don’t talk about it ever but it crosses my mind every single day. Am I overreacting like he says? I know he wouldn’t like this to happen to him because he told me when we first started dating his boundaries and this was one of them. 

TLDR: fiance added a girl when he was on a trip abroad that he was a bit too friendly with. Says he didn’t physically cheat and I can’t get over it. Seriously thinking of breaking up but i feel horrible because i stayed with him an extra 10 months after finding out (as if i was leading him on i just didn’t know I wouldn’t get over it). Should I just continue staying in the relationship? I already stayed almost a year…and we're now engaged. I truly do love him.. I just believe this is actually cheating and I’ve been cheated on. Do you think so too?",2024-11-11 11:42:13

We used to argue a lot during our first year of dating, but over the years things have become better.

Recently, though, I started wondering if things have actually gotten better or if I just gave up on things and stopped standing up for myself. I find myself just agreeing to a lot of things or putting my needs aside for the sake of not upsetting my girlfriend.

One example is that we recently had an argument over whether or not phone calls use cellular data. She's overseas visiting her family right now and told me that we can't talk because of data usage. I told her international phone calls don't use data and she randomly exploded on me. I told her I'm sorry and she said that I'm a good person but she wishes I could be more humble at times.

Anyway I feel like I've become the shell of the person I used to be. Is this a normal thing or should I just break up with her? The thought of breaking up is honestly quite scary, as our lives are very closely intertwined that it almost feels like a divorce in some ways.

TL;DR GF and I have had so many arguments that I find myself always apologizing even when I'm right. It's gotten to the point that I'm considering going to therapy because I constantly feel anxiety and sadness. Wondering if I should break up or if this is normal.",2024-11-10 11:36:07

He says it’s about disrespect which I partly understand but the anger when I go on his phone just gives me a terrible feeling. We’ve also had some large fights in our relationship and I don’t entirely trust him and sometimes don’t feel secure. We do however have so much good and when we’re good we’re golden, it’s the most love i’ve ever felt and i feel so card about, however these times are not consistent and the lack of security is making me feel so replaceable and unloved despite our chemistry and good moments, i want us to work however I don’t see commitment from him especially over a prolonged period of time and the time I have felt this way. I don’t want us to end but I don’t believe he truly feels the same way about me and think it may be the time to call it quits despite me wanting us more than I thought I could. I have strong attachment issues and my love for him is still really strong, what do I do? Do I try to communicate? Do I let go? Do I disappear? I’ve never been in a situation like this and I feel like nothing I have done so far is working and I feel honestly lost. I know this is sort of vague but for someone with attachment issues is it worth trying to save this relationship or let go? We have been together for 7 months and I worry this isn’t worth the struggle anymore.

To give some context my girlfriend is on this community basketball team in our area and she's passionate about it she used to play it when she was younger and she enjoys being able to get back into it and get better. A friend of my girlfriends who I'll refer to as GF Friend mentioned to my girlfriend on how a guy who is friends with GF Friend was teasing GF Friend saying she couldn't beat him in basketball, someway or somewhere in the conversation my girlfriend is mentioned and now it's a 2v1 against this guy. 

 Really and truly its just a basketball game there is nothing wrong with that. But for me a guy, knowing how other guys are this feels a bit weird. Imaging my girl and this other girl fighting to steal a basketball from this guy as their all laughing I feel insecure and a bit jealous. A guy asking 2 girls to 2v1 him is generally the guy trying to get with those girls. Now my girl seems really excited to go play this match as.

""Hes not beating  the two of us.""

 I dont wanna be that insecure boyfriend who takes something away from her and i don't know if my feelings are justified because it's not like she actually doing anything. And she's loyal too, everything a guy does try and get with her she tells me and yeah. 

 How do I explain these feelings to my girlfriend without potentially sabotaging the relationship.

She moved back in with my (60F) mom shortly after having her (6mo/male) baby, who’s now six months old. Since then, things between us have become increasingly strained. I’ve known for a while that she has some emotional issues—she has a rocky relationship with our dad, cut him and our stepmom’s family off about six years ago, and has struggled to maintain friendships.

One recurring pattern is that she tends to pick on one person at a time, giving them the silent treatment until she feels she has control over the situation again. Her need for control has affected my mom, my sisters, and my social life as well. She often finds faults with each of our romantic partners and treats them with extreme rudeness and verbal aggression, even when they’re in our mom’s house—where she insists no one can stay. She’s also rearranged our mom’s belongings without permission, moving things to the garage. She’s even loud and disruptive while my mom tries to work, showing no regard for what others are doing around her. Yet, if someone she doesn’t want around is visiting, even quietly, it’s somehow unacceptable to her.

Each of us has chores around the house, and lately, I’ve struggled to keep up due to my job and exhaustion. I work full-time, while she doesn’t have a job. Recently, she’s become more aggressive and even violent with me because I haven’t been home as much to complete household tasks. For example, when I try to rest, she’ll bang on my door and tell me, “If you don’t get up right now, you might as well leave and never come back.” It’s really hurtful, especially since I just recovered from an illness and am still exhausted. She won’t let me rest, and every time she sees me, she tells me what I need to do and accuses me of not doing enough. When my (19F) younger sister got sick recently, she wouldn’t even allow her to step out of her room.

After all this, we got into an argument, and now she’s giving me the silent treatment. The argument was over something minor—I accidentally left some water on the bathroom floor after a shower. She sent a group message to me and our younger sister, saying, “F*** you for leaving water on the floor; learn to be a decent human being… maybe you should go back to church.” She went on to tell me how worthless I am and accused me of abandoning the family when it’s convenient. The most hurtful thing, though, was when she said, “I’m done letting you near my son.” She meant it, too—when I tried to say goodbye to him before work a few days later, she told me to “stay the f*** away from him.”

I’m heartbroken at the thought of losing my relationship with my nephew. I’m exhausted from being yelled at, called names, and constantly controlled. I’m feeling really lost and would be so grateful for any help.

TL;DR, Since my sister moved back in with my mom, she’s become controlling and aggressive, even stopping me from seeing my nephew. I’m exhausted and hurt, and I need advice on handling her behavior.",2024-11-11 04:04:02

I have been dealing with body image issues for as long as I remembered. Growing up a girl, there's always been immense pressure to be skinny. For most of my teen and adult life (I'm in my mid-20s), i've been 5'3"" and 115lbs - personally, for me this is pretty skinny. There's been a handful of times where my weight has fluctuate upwards to 125-130 lbs, but I always get it back down to 115-120lbs, mostly due to body image issues and pressure to ""be skinny"". I've had a ton of issues and always self-conscious as soon as i cross the 117lb threshold. I love food though so every time i have to go on a ""diet"" (though i know it's not healthy to go on a fast diet to get to a goal weight) it really crushes me. I have always been somewhat active through school, different sports casually, but i'm definitely not a gym rat, i usually was just able to get steps in with during school with an active/walkable schedule.

In the last year, I had an accident, have had multiple surgeries and have been on all sorts of meds (nothing crazy, just pain medication and antibiotics, but it's still more than the average person and more than I've ever taken in my life, at least consistently). In the past 6 months, I was able to get to a pretty healthy active lifestyle, doing yoga for an hour 4-5 times a week, and working out for an hour 1-2 a week, and eating 2 meals a day. I was feeling really good about myself, i did gain some weight but I've felt much happier about my body and healthier, especially because i have workout regiments in place, even though I'm at about 132lb right now, which is the heaviest i've ever been. I think the meds has also been affecting my metabolism so it isn't as easy for me to lose weight as much.

My boyfriend (we've been together for almost 5 years) texted me a couple of weeks ago (we are in a long distance relationship), saying that he's noticed that he is less attracted to me now because I've gained some weight. I was really upset by this. He knows how i've felt in the past about my body and he knows that recently is the first time i've felt positively about my body because of all of the exercises I've been able to implement. Though I can understand that that is his preference and that i've gained about 15 lbs so it might be different for him, it is still really hurtful, because i feel like i'm thrown back into the ring because i need to be skinny rather than being what I am now. I feel good about my body, because with the weight gain my boobs are also getting bigger and I like that I have curves. I'm sure i can lose a few pounds, but to drop so much weight and upholding it means i can't eat all the food i want anymore or always have to be in the gym. Now I'm starting to doubt myself and wanting to go on ""diets"" and counting calories again. I live in differrent cities with my family, and they haven't seen me since the accident, I'm visiting them soon and i know they will say the same thing as him. So it's adding fuel to the fire, with pressure on me to just drop weight to be ""skinny"".

I told him how much it bothers me and that I think it's so hurtful because even though he is not physically my type, I would never say that because I love him for more than that, and i would encourage him to be healthier not just tell him that he's too skinny or too fat just because it's an aesthetic preference. He has said sorry but he can't take it back because now i'll always know how he feels. It just kinda confirms to me that unless i'm 115lbs, i will be less attractive to him. Don't really know what to do in this situation. Should I take it as constructive criticism and try to lose weight while keeping up the exercising? Or should I try to forget his comment?

TLDR: I've been 5'3"" and 115lbs for most of my adult life, I'm 132 lbs now and my boyfriend said that he's less attractive to me since i've gained weight (we've been together for almost 5 years) even though this is the most consistent i've been with my exercising regiment and the first time in a while I've felt good about my body. I also had an accident a year ago and have been going through multiple surgeries and meds, which could be affecting my weight. He knows all of this. I'm starting to doubt myself and wanting to go on ""diets"" and counting calories again. What should I do?",2024-11-10 03:17:58

My boyfriend [M 17] and I [F 17] have been dating for 5-ish months now. We had our first big argument on Halloween. In a nutshell, he was getting ready for a night of trick-or-treating with his friends. Unfortunately, at the same time, I had gotten some bad news that ruined my night. I had told him, however he still ended up going out with his friends. I was bummed that he left when I needed his support, but I agreed with his decision - I still wanted him to go out and have fun. We didn't clear things up until about two days later. He stayed out for a while during Halloween and the day after that he had plans with one of his two sisters [F 24]. When we finally tried to reconcile, he yelled at me and cursed at me. Although I do admit some of the ways I treated the issue weren't the best, the way he treated it wasn't either. We both asked for some space from each other and we eventually got over it and promised to improve for each other and it's been going well ever since. Today, him and I were on call, he had asked for some alone time, I complied, and he came back to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said that when he was out with his sister, he had vented to her about what had happened. He explained what she had said about me; she was insulting me - cursing at me, calling me inconsiderate, needy - and he had told me that she had given him an ultimatum: ""break up with her or I'm not your sister anymore.""
Obviously, he chose me, but that's taken a toll on him. I realized that a lot of what his sister said was near-close to what he had insulted me with when we had tried to reconcile. I asked him if he said those things because of his sister and he shamefully admitted that he did. He said that not long after he told his sister, she had told their mom about him and I, ruining his plans on telling his mom about us once he turns 18 next January. His mom disapproves of our relationship, saying that he grew attitude problems ever since he started dating me. Two months prior to this, him and his other sister [F 28] had gotten into an argument as well. My boyfriend was planning to tell her about me, but before he could, she had stalked my instagram profile and had threatened to tell their mom. My boyfriend and her haven't talked ever since.  

He's lost his mom's approval and contact with both of his sisters. He told me to give him a week of space to think and act on the situation. He plans to talk to his family about us to hopefully change their minds, but if they still don't approve, then that's when he'll make his decision: either me or them. A little side note: he told me that him and his sisters argue a lot and they tend to ghost each other a lot as well. We had a conversation about this earlier, and he said that whether or not I'm present in his life, his family will still continue with their arguing/ghosting behavior. It isn't a matter of who's who - it's a matter of whoever he's more happy with keeping in his life; and he's leaning towards choosing me. He did say that his sister (the one who insulted me) wants what's best for him, but if she truly wanted the best for him, then she wouldn't have gave him an ultimatum, she would have gave him advice. As much as I want him to choose me, I also want him to choose his family; I'd feel so bad if he doesn't. 

Is his sister (the 24yo) right? Is this what's best for him? Who should he choose? Is this unfair or is it justified? I'm very conflicted. Input needed 😞

TLDR; My boyfriend and I (both 17) have been dating for 5 months, and recently had a big argument after Halloween when he went out with his friends while I was upset. After a couple of days, we reconciled, though the discussion was heated. Now, he’s facing a tough situation with his family. He vented to his sister (24), who insulted me and gave him an ultimatum: break up with me or she would sever ties with him. His mom disapproves of our relationship, and he's lost contact with both sisters, leaving him with a choice: his family or me. He’s leaning toward choosing me but has asked for a week of space to figure things out. He believes his family’s issues are unrelated to our relationship, but he’s still conflicted. I want him to choose me but I also feel bad if he loses his family, and I'm uncertain about what the best choice is.",2024-11-11 00:04:02
relationships,1gou39y,Can't cope with partner porn habit ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gou39y/cant_cope_with_partner_porn_habit/,50,"Hi everyone. I'm looking for some advice. I apologise in advance for the length of post.

I (36F) have been with my partner (33M) for almost 5 years. We've been living together for around 3.5 years. 

Throughout the early days of our relationship, I made it clear to him that I do not like porn. A previous long-term relationship of mine ended for a variety of a reasons, but one of the main issues was my ex partner's porn addiction. Although I have never outright stated that I don't want my current partner watching porn and he has never outright stated he doesn't, I feel I have made my feelings clear and he has definitely insinuated that he isn't a fan of porn and has very much slated my ex for his behaviour. 

We have always had a good sex life and I would say I'm quite adventurous (more so than my partner) and have a relatively high libido, however in recent months the frequency of our sex dropped to around once per week. I put this down to work and general life stressors. I wasn't really initiating often and neither was he. 

Last month we went on a holiday abroad for 6 days. Our sex life was better than it has ever been throughout this time. On the 5th evening, my phone stopped working entirely. Thankfully my partner had brought an old phone with him so I was able to put my SIM card in his current phone and he was able to use the old phone he had brought. The next day, I had to check the details for our airport transfer. We were in the hotel room whilst I done this. To get to the transport website, I typed in ""www."" and the first thing that came up was PornHub. I know I shouldn't have done this but I was panicking, so after seeing that I went into the history and searched for PornHub. It only went back a few months but it turns out he has been watching porn 3/4/5 times a week and it is whilst I'm at home. I can't lie; I completely overreacted. Tears and shouting, the works. He reacted angrily, was clearly embarrassed and tried to make me feel like I was being ridiculous. 

Since we returned home, we've had a small chat about it. He was slightly more understanding but there was still very much a sense of him downplaying how much he watches porn and making out like I'm being ridiculous.

Since then, I've tried to be ""cool"", but I just can't get over it. It's entirely eating me up inside and I can barely think about anything else. I'm looking into labiaplasty and lip filler and Botox and all manner of things because I just can't stop thinking that he watches porn because he isn't attracted to me. Any time he goes in the shower or I leave the house, my head tells me he is at home masturbating over other women. Whenever we have sex, I convince myself he is fantasising about someone else. I have previously suffered from severe Anorexia and I'm struggling to not convince myself that becoming seriously underweight will mean he is more attracted to me and will therefore not need porn. 

I should add that I do suffer from major depression, anxiety, PMDD and ADHD, however I am medicated for these things (minus the ADHD) and work hard to keep them under control. 

I know I'm overreacting massively, but please, what should I do? Talk to him about my feelings again? Ask him not to watch porn? Get therapy? Break up with him? I just feel so low and lost and my self-esteem is at absolute rock bottom. 

TLDR: Found out long-term partner of 5 years watches a lot of porn even whilst I am at home. He has insinuated for years he isn't into porn. I have previous trauma relating to this due to an ex's porn addiction and am struggling to cope. Should I break up with him?


ETA UPDATE; I just want to thank everyone for their comments and advice. It really made such a big difference to me. I actually had a very open and honest discussion with my partner today on the back of your comments and it has made things so much better. We have some boundaries in place in regard to porn and we are making changes where required. I am also going to go back into therapy for my difficulties with self-esteem and he is considering doing the same (for a variety of reasons). 

Thanks again, everyone  💗",2024-11-11 14:58:18

We took both girls because Girl A and girl B are best friends and we were trying to meet new people. Starting off the weekend, my friend ended up getting super fucked up to the point where he had to go to the hospital and he ended up having to go home early. Because of this, for the rest of the weekend I had to entertain both girl A and B (we were staying in a room together and had dinner and events we had to go to). Hanging out with both girl A and B, I had a great time, but started realizing I like girl B (my friends date) more than girl A (my date). So the weekend went on and that was that, but I feel like girl A was interested in me (she asked me if I wanted to leave the party early etc. like she wanted to hook up) and obviously I did nothing because I was feeling girl B.
After the weekend girl A was still acting interested and I completely ghosted her because I just wasn't interested. Now, it's been about 3 weeks since this away weekend and I have talked to girl A and B a little at the bars when we go out but don't snap or talk to either of them on a regular basis. We now have another date event coming up this week and I want to invite girl B because l've kinda been crushing on her, but I feel like it would be tucked up because girl A seemed interested in me and girl A & B are best friends. This is such a tricky situation and I feel like girl B might be interested, but am not sure. How do yall think I should handle this, move on and ask some random girl or approach in some way with girl B?

TL;DR I like this one girl whose friend seemingly liked me.",2024-11-11 02:40:37
relationships,1golq7r,25m Lost first and thought to be true love 24f. How do I cope and go about getting her back? If possible at all? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1golq7r/25m_lost_first_and_thought_to_be_true_love_24f/,6,"Title kinda. But towards the end of college (2020-2021 year) I hit a real low. Had to leave my frat, didn’t know where I was gonna live, etc. not the typical frat guy tho. Love metal music, I’d like to think I’m kind, patient, and I have a huge heart. Probably part of the reason that happened, I’m not necessarily fitting in.

Anyway that took a huge toll on me, feeling ousted, not good enough, and left out to dry. Also giving me huge social anxiety, afraid to show my face anywhere. I went to a hotel the night before and snapped a girl I was seeing something like “hey, not sure I’ll ever be back here but you’ve been so great, and thanks for being that”.

She came that night to console me. We weren’t together or anything yet. So she is just a kind a pure soul. Needless to say I fell very fast. I ended up finding an apartment, we hung out most everyday. I Eventually, we got together. However; due to past traumas and that experience, I started to drink heavily. And after graduating college, due to issues at home, I had to “move out” before I was ready and was financially struggling. As well as emotionally. 

Point is- even though there is a lack of detail, be assured there is a lot more nuance and context that led to my mental decline. Yet she stood by me for all of it. Needless to say, with life moving so fast for me like that, I had to keep my head down and work and make ends meet. I didn’t have a choice. Either that, or be homeless, or whatever. Leading to me ignoring my unresolved traumas and personal issues, developing unhealthy coping habits, and leaning on her too hard.

Anyway, I’ll try to keep this short. But over the 4 years we fell madly in love, despite my issues. However, it was clear that towards the end, my issues started to take a toll on her. She is a true angel, she tries to help and solve everyone’s problems. Mine, her friends, her family’s (which also her parents had a very toxic divorce, and her mother became an alcoholic that was hospitalized multiple times). So she took on so much, and stopped prioritizing herself as much. Which led to her lashing out more, having a short fuse, and arguing over little irrelevant things. And my problem was I got comfortable leaning. Stopped doing the little things as much, and didn’t clearly see the warning signs. Although, I love her more than life, I could have done more. 

Finally, we had just come back (about a month ago from me writing this) from a trip to her childhood friends wedding. Towards the end of the trip I could feel something was very wrong. She told me she needs space, and I could see the dead look in her eyes. She was tired. Broken. I was very scared. When we landed back, she told me she needed space. Like for “real”. I was decimated. As was she. She told me she loved me, kissed me, and to wait for her. Wait until she was healed.

Very hard, but I received a letter from her in the mail a few days later reiterating that fact. To wait for her. But wasn’t sure If that was healthy, but she knew she wanted me, yet knew she couldn’t support a relationship in the way and effort she should.

A few weeks later, we just stopped talking. And a few days after that, I tried to call a friend to vent but accidentally clicked her name. I quickly hung up. I woke up to something along the lines of “I saw your FT call. But I have to be honest. Idk what to say. It’s over. I’m not going back into a relationship, etc.” it’s so unlike her to be so cut and dry and bland. She is the sweetest person I know. Part of me thinks/hopes she kept it that way to avoid the extremely emotional stuff that comes with a “goodbye”. Because that is not her. 

Forgive the length here, but this is a vent as much as it is a request for tips. I am heartbroken. Destroyed. She was with me at my lowest. And that’s who they usually say is the “one”. The keeper. I’ve been through a lot but I’ve never felt a pain cut so deep. And what bothers me just as much in a matter of weeks it went from
“Wait for me. I’ll heal, I’ll grow, and we can do life together” with so much emotions and love
To
“Yeah, I don’t think so. Not gonna happen. This is it. Goodbye”. 
TL:DR- me very sad and need help to move forward or recover love",2024-11-11 06:16:11

So.. me (F32) and my fiance (F34) have been together for 8 years. We went to his work Christmas party and had a fair bit to drink and a large group ended up going to a night club after the event ended. We were all on the dance floor but I left for 10 minutes to go to the bathroom. Walking back I see him and one of his colleague dancing very close, basically grinding on each other. It really stood out as the rest of the group was dancing together, but more in the ""rubbing shoulder"" way. He finally spotted me and stopped and stepped away. Tbh, I felt quite humiliated and went home shortly after. 

We don't have any said rules about not dancing with other people and I am kind of stuck between feeling very betrayed but also thinking ""they were just dancing"" if that makes sense.. what would be your reaction to this?

He has another work even coming up soon, and I feel like I will be anxious about him going, and I really hate that feeling.. Before the ""dancing event"" I wouldn't have thought twice about it, and I don't want to tell him not to go.. does anyone have any good suggestions on how to handle this new feeling of anxiety/ jealousy?

**TL-DR** Fiance dancing/ grinding with colleague, is this OK and how can how to handle a new feeling of anxiety and jealousy about him going to work events",2024-11-09 23:58:52

My partner and I have been together for almost 7 years but this is the first time we've been long distance. Even before we were physically separated, we've always had issue about her not putting enough effort in the relationship but l've always stayed because I do love her. She is emotionally unavailable and always thinks logically. She doesn't have any history of infidelity and I do truly trust her in that part. But now that we're long distance, it's just been very hard communicating with her in terms of our feelings and our future. Whenever I try to bring up what I am feeling towards her actions, or lack thereof, she just stops talking to me unless I change the subject.
She keeps saying she's busy. I understand that since she has two jobs and managing a business, but sometimes, I just want her to be there for me and I am not getting that. I honestly dont know what to do. I love her and we've invested a lot of years together. I dont know if I am overreacting or overthinking all of it. It's reached a point where I dont know if she's just waiting for me to break up with her so that she could move forward. Do you have any advice for me?

My boyfriend and I are both 18, and lately, we’ve hit a bit of a weird spot. Life has gotten busy on my end, and I haven't been paying as much attention to him as usual. I'm not exactly sure why, maybe just stress or juggling a lot of things, but I know I’ve been more distant. He's been getting understandably frustrated and a bit angry about it. I know I could be doing more to show him he matters, but I'm not sure where to start to make it better without feeling forced or fake. I kinda consider myself a pessimistic person when it comes to relationships, despite my very extroverted personality. 

We have been dating for a little over 4 months, and it’s been pretty smooth. He gets angry and I don’t know what to say and he thinks thats concerning and showing that I don’t love him. 

I genuinely don’t know what to say because I feel like ill upset him or I can’t think of it and then I say the wrong thing and he gets upset. He’s a lot more communicative than me, not that I don’t want to be but I don’t know how. This is my first relationship, but this is his second or third. In general I just don’t know what to do, because part of me loves him and wants to stay but the other half is like.. idk. Is that a sign that if I even have any doubts its bad?

TLDR: My boyfriend thinks I don’t love him anymore because I don’t prioritize him enough and can’t explain how I feel well and it frustrates him.",2024-11-11 01:19:50

i don’t want to be rude, i have complained about a few other things they do that is annoying for me (not doing dishes, not doing laundry, having like 12 alarms when i am asleep and they don’t ever turn them off) so i feel like they are really gonna get pissed at me if i keep adding to the list

It was fun but I didn’t want to progress so we cut ties for a period of time. A few weeks ago she reached out to me on Snapchat seemingly to strike conversation of a relationship again, and I once again told her about how I wasn’t looking to move forward with her in that manner. To this she suggested we could have a connection “without expectations” which sounds similar to “friends with benefits” to me. (She admitted feeling horny and was looking for something casual) I was interested in this so I agreed and told her about my current schedule so she could reach out to me when available and we’d coordinate meeting up. This is where things got a little confusing: after agreeing to this plan, I then texted her something along the lines of “we’ll talk soon :)” to which she left me on delivered for 2 days, only to open it and respond with “aww ok :)”. This as you can imagine felt weird to me and left me feeling that she lost interest pretty suddenly. After a few weeks of her not texting I then initiated saying “someone wasn’t as interested as I thought they were huh” to which she replied with “I’ve just been so busy”. Of course I apologized here and gave her insight to my thinking saying I thought she might of got some sort of “post-horny clarity” to which she responded with “haha yeah just so so busy”.

This girl isn’t that interested in a casual relationship with me after all right? Second, since I’m sensing she isn’t interested it frustrates me deeply, especially since I gave her a chance to tell me how she truly feels and seems to be dodging that conversation. Not to mention the fact that she initiated this conversation with me in the first place. How can I approach these feelings and act on it? Personally I want to text her again about it or even do something extreme like cut her off entirely, while another side of me tells myself to let it be. It’s just frustrating.

I (21 F) and my boyfriend (22 M) have been together for 2 years now. When somethings wrong, he always says “it’s not like you would do it anyway” or “no point in talking about it. Won’t solve anything.” or “I was planning on organising dinner on Friday but there’s no point because you’ll probably be working anyway.” or if I ask him what’s wrong I get “nothing. Doesn’t matter.”



Most of the time he’s upset because we can’t have sex. Half of our relationship we could barely do it due to endometriosis and other medical problems, and once that got better everything was fine. Now that I’m a midwifery student my life is crazy, I’m always on call and I’m always either studying, on placement, or sleeping because I’ve been at the hospital for 11 hours. So our sex life isn’t very active but we are intimate about once a week, which isn’t bad considering we don’t live together and live with our families. I’m trying my best to find time but while I’m still studying it’s just too hard. 



He wanted to do it yesterday and I turned down his advances because I just had a horrible day (I helped a mother deliver her stillborn) and he just went all passive aggressive on me again. “It’s fine I’m used to it” and “I didn’t give myself high hopes anyway”. I just burst into tears because I had no idea how to feel. I felt guilty, but also confused because he tried to make moves on me 10 minutes after I told him about what happened at work. He said he just feels rejected and that I don’t want to have sex with him because I’m not attracted to him, which is completely false, I want to be intimate but it’s hard when he’s constantly pushing it at inappropriate times.




I try so hard to constantly reassure him and compromise, when I can, I try to organise times where we can get intimate but he hates when I do that because “it feels scheduled”. I have even tried surprising him with a romantic date night towards the end we went for a drive to a lookout and I went to make love to him but he pushed me away saying it felt forced and asked why it’s only okay if we do it on my terms.



This is just becoming a daily thing and idk if it’s actually his insecurities or if it’s manipulation. I don’t know how to explain it. It almost seems like he’s fishing for coddling. 



I have mild autism so I struggle with reading people and situations so I just genuinely don’t know. Please tell me if I’m the problem, i understand wouldn’t be easy to date someone who’s constantly busy.

So I (24M) was cheated on 8 months back by my girlfriend of 7 years. A lot of things went down with her where I gave her a second chance and everything. But she betrayed me and lied to me and I ended this thing. Throughout this phase a friend of mine (26F) she helped me a lot in this phase. She used to sit and listen to me, gave me advice and was genuinely concerned for me in this phase. We used to go out to places together to talk even after things ended. I was genuinely happy when we spent time together and soon realised I had fallen in love with her. 

I know it might sound like rebound or just being vulnerable but I went through my feelings for 3 months and realised that this was not the case. What I feel is genuine love which I felt for my Ex girlfriend. 

To give you a background Me and her are from same home country and we both are classmates in an International program in a different country where we met 1 year ago and became friends. 4 months into me moving here my Ex cheated on me. My classmate is in a relationship with her boyfriend for 2 years and out of which more than 1 year is long distance. But she genuinely loves him and also thinking of her future with him. 

Now my question is should I confess my feelings to her or continue staying good friends with her. Because I know once I confess she is going to reject me and there is a good chance it will ruin our friendship. Though I wont say that there is 0.0001% chance she will say yes. 

But thing is I dont want to ruin things for her and her boyfriend. They both are genuinely good people. And I dont want to do anything that will make her unhappy. By any chance if she says yes I dont want her to cheat on him. Because I know it first hand how painful it is. I want her to end things formally with him before starting a genuine relationship with me. But I will become the villain in front of her boyfriend how the guy who helped my gf in cheating was to me.

relationships,1go7lcu,Drinking Husband Gets Shifts Covered,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go7lcu/drinking_husband_gets_shifts_covered/,41,"Me (F26) have been in a relationship with (M31) for 10 years and recently married. We’ve had quite a few problems in our relationship but have managed to overcome it… except this. My husband suffers from extreme depression to a point he never keeps a job for more than a year; he has lost 5. He has refused to get up for work and would lay in bed and play video games while I work to keep us alive. Lately, he has got a new job he finds suitable for him and says he doesn’t want to ‘fuck this up for us’, and yet I’m seeing a repeated pattern. Me, him and another friend of ours manage the store. I find my husband telling me he wants to play video games and get drunk with his friends because he’s depressed and says it helps him; gives him relief. I cover him, even our friend covers him, but I’m seeing it’s becoming more and more. I should add, he has also been into drugs and heavy drinking. He keeps drink at work and has some off shift. Friends say I’m an enabler and help him way too much… saying normal people would just give up and leave. I just want to make my husband happy. I feel so useless. Friends say to get rid of the drink but I don’t think he’ll give it up. If I sent him to rehab, he’ll say I don’t understand him. Sometimes it feels like I’m married to someone who doesn’t want to grow up. I’m wanting to get pregnant soon and I do literally everything for him, like driving him, doing his bills and appointments. He doesn’t seem to fully enjoy anything of the outside world and just evolves around video games. We went for a hike not long ago and he was slightly mad he missed out video games for our time together. He also tends to get upset if I don’t last until the early mornings if we both decide to game together... if I go to bed he will stay up and try to milk the night. Any suggestions and thoughts on my situation? 

I should add he works 5 days a week across 39 hours. Recently covered this weekend to play video games and get drunk. Sometimes he can go for a span of 16 hours nonstop and drinking 2 litres of alcohol. He also likes to drink throughout the week, sometimes on a Monday which is considered his weekend off, he will play video games alone and get drunk. He is still sweet and will wake up hungover for me, offer me emotional support, compliments me and says I saved his life and he's nothing without me, but I’m finding it becoming tiring now and feel if I confront him, it will just ruin his mood.

TLDR: my depressed husband wants to drink and play video games while I cover for him.  Nothing is progressing with him growing up from this.

Edit: my husband has been on many medications before (would take them while drinking!!!) shrooms and acid to try and cure him. He says therapy is a waste of time and the actual therapists say he should take the job instead of them. He is a spiritual kind of guy who says he wants to help people but cannot help himself.

Edit 2: he has never covered for any of us. When our friend covers him, my husband gets upset that he takes the pay check than giving it to us and says our friend should give it over as a sacrifice on his part because they’re friends",2024-11-10 18:43:16

I personally thought things have been going well and I could genuinely see a future with her. Unfortunately, her ex (30M) recently came back into her life as her coworker. At first, I was a bit worried about her and that situation, but was reassured by her that she’s completely over that guy.   
  
However, lately she’s been spending more time at work and returning home later and later than usual. She started hiding her phone from me and insisting that I do things without her over the weekend.   
  
After finally having enough, I confronted her and asked her for clarity especially noticing her attitude change around me. She admitted that she’s confused and started having renewed feelings for her ex, but also values our relationship. She then proceeds to ask for a break while she figures this out and where her emotions are.  
  
I’m so torn.  I love this woman, but I don’t want to feel like the second option and especially to someone whom she had history with. What should I do?

Hi all, I've never posted on Reddit before so here goes nothing. (This is my second time trying to post this because the other paragraph was accidentally deleted.) 
For context, I'm (26/nb) and my partner is (26/m) and we have been together 5 years. A year ago we were having a conversation about relationships and whatnot. He revealed to me that while I was dating my ex, said ex tried to cheat on me with him. (We all knew eachother)
I was shocked to say the least. 
My ex wasn't a good person and I ended up having to leave him while he was at work because I feared for my safety. 
If my partner had of told me this while I was seeing my ex, I would have left him and have been free from heartache and trauma. 
I asked him why he didn't tell me and he said he didn't know and that he was sorry. 
I can't stop thinking about it a year later when he thinks it's over with and done.

Today I woke up in the middle of the night and hit a cockroach that was on my side table. This woke up my partner. He said to me why are you waking me up. I replied with Im sorry I woke you up I saw a cockroach and was killing it. He then said no there’s no cockroach you were obviously trying to wake me up, you were just trying to be mean. I then said no I wasn’t intentionally trying to wake you up I’m sorry I woke you up I shouldn’t have tried to kill the cockroach. He then replied basically the same saying no obviously it was your intention to wake me up you were trying to be mean and aggressive.

He then got upset at me for saying I don’t appreciate words being put in my mouth and that only I know my intentions. He told me it isn’t fair to say that because he’s the one that should be upset and to just drop it because I’m just obviously just annoyed at him and trying to be mean.

My question is, should I just accept I was trying to wake him/be mean and just not have an argument? He does this a lot where he will assume my intention even after I have clarified it and will often assume I meant something in a bad way when I didn’t. He thinks it’s unreasonable to clarify the situation and that any normal person would just accept they tried to wake the person up because it’s a logical conclusion of hitting a cockroach. But that wasn’t my intention, so it feels icky to apologise for an intention that wasn’t mine. 

I apologised for waking him up over and over and said I shouldn’t have hit the cockroach but that I wouldn’t apologise for intentionally and maliciously trying to wake him up.

Am I being unreasonable? I get really triggered by being told I did something or felt a certain way when I didn’t and I’m finding it really hard to find a middle ground on this.

relationships,1go0eor,Is my partner cheating?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go0eor/is_my_partner_cheating/,6,"Whether emotionally or physically I'm not too sure, but here goes. 

I (29M) think we've become distant recently, and I think it could be due to me being relatively needy and overbearing. Little things I do seem to set her off and then sometimes we don't communicate properly for a couple of days afterwards. This probably really started a couple of months ago. 

About a month ago she was on her phone infront of me showing me an IG message from someone and when she went back to her main messages there was a guys name in there. Because I am naturally paranoid and have been cheated on in the past, I went through some of her recent pictures and he's liked a large number of them. I didn't think too much of it, she's an incredibly beautiful woman (32F) and there are lots of guys that like her pictures, but the fact that he was in her messages has continued to play on my mind. I was able to dispel the thiughts in my head mostly because I'm oretty sure if someone reacts to your story it will come up in your messages (please correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not a prolific social media user). Recently she has been a lot more guarded with her phone than normal but still uses it infront of me from time to time. Fast forward to a few days ago and she was on her phone again on Instagram and she went to search for something and his name was there again as her most recent search. There was an instance a few weeks ago where we were having a discussion about our relationship (instigated by me cause she's not a grest communicator) and I asked her if there was anything else going on that she wanted to tell me and her immediate response was ""What? Like I have another boyfriend or something?""

I'm trying my hardest to assume that there's a good explanation but the paranoia is getting the better of me. I know her schedule pretty inside out and I cannot conceive of any time where she would have the time to physically meet up with someone else, but she could be emotionally cheating and given that I feel there's less intimacy and less romance in our relationship recently it stands that she could be satisfying that elsewhere.

TL;DR a guy's name has come up in multiple instances on my GF's Instagram and I think she might be communicating with him emotionally/romantically after I've pushed her away by being too overbearing. ",2024-11-10 13:14:51

He is a wonderful person & he treats me very well, we love each other very much. However, his family all got married very young (I'm talking 21/22) & he expressed that he wants to marry me. I'm still in school, and told him I'd want to be in a relationship for at least 5 years before even considering marriage. Is it bad that I get scared at the thought of marriage with him? I truly love him, I'm happy with him, but I have a fear of getting divorced and our relationship hasn't been perfect. He has done things in the past that I view as disloyal/immature, however I think we've both grown a lot together & he doesn't repeat his mistakes. I also had met a man before I met him that I thought would become a serious partner, however I met that person at a very low point in my life, & he ended up telling me he didn't want a relationship yet got into one with another woman shortly after. Although we didn't date, I think that man may have been my first love, & I still think of him from time to time. That person evoked feelings in me that no one else ever has, not even my current bf. All around, I just need some advice. I'm feeling guilty and naiive, can someone help me out with this?

TL;DR:
Is it normal to feel scared to get married, even if you love someone? Or does he deserve someone who’s as sure as him right now? How do you know if it’s the right person? (He respects my wishes btw, we are definitely waiting, I just don’t know 1000% that he’s “the one”)",2024-11-10 21:43:55

Been fighting a lot and today he told me to not go overboard with a bag of choc he bought me. Now I'm upset and resentful.

Husband and I (both in our early 30's) have been together 4 years now. For the most part he's great. Supports me, 50/50 household chores, picks up the slack when I have nothing in my tank and vice versa. He's started a new landscaping business about 1.5 years ago and it's going well. He's been completely inundated with work and has had to expand a bit so overheads are quite high and he's not paying himself properly.

I work FT office/home hybrid and make a good amount of money. I've fully paid for our 1 year anniversay holiday early next year (several k) and will be taking over the entire mortgage payment for the next couple of months while his business brings in better cash flow. I'm happy to do this because he's done the same for me before when I was in between jobs.

But good lord he comes home in the foulest of moods sometimes. He told me I'm too controlling because I make him 'fold the laundry' or ask him to do one thing or another. Ok I get it, give him some space when he comes home before I ask for anything. But he tells me he's so exhausted that he doesn't want to do anything. He prefers to clean the kitchen etc in the morning before work but this isn't consistent as he's running late sometimes. He made it clear when it all came to a few days ago where we had just the biggest fight (and he almost moved out) that if I wanted things done to do them myself or wait for him to do it in his time. But like... he goes to the gym and I don't get how one can have gym (specifically gymnastics) energy but not fold laundry energy.

For context, the fight started when he made a supposedly inadvertent sexist comment (I don't think he is though as he has a lot of female role models and goes out of his way to work with women because they're easier to work with or so he says) and I tried to educate him as to why that was wrong. He apologised and said he wouldn't do it again but like... it's been a tough week to be a woman and I wasn't going to let go so easily. I may have pushed by trying to explain why what he said was wrong and he ended up just losing it and yelling at me to stop.

We talked it out and spent several hours getting to the core of our issue, where he's promised he's going to seek professional help for stress management. Awesome.

Still a little sore from all the recent fighting (and here is where I need objective opinions) - he bought me a giant bag of Twix bars as a treat. When he gave them to me he said ""don't go overboard with these"". Oh man. I've had weight issues all my life and was subjected to my mum saying stuff like that all the time growing up, and he knows this. I'm actively working on my health and have been doing so well, I've lost so much weight and can almost outlift my PT. But I still have a long way to go. This comment hurt, it made me feel like a child. I'm starting to grow quite resentful again. No one told me marriage was going to be this hard.

If at all useful info we are both neurospicy.

We have been togheter for almost 1,5 years now. Overall we have healthy relationship. But we have to take long  distance for 1,5 years beacause of different majors. Seeing eachother 2-3 times a month

TLDR

I kinda worried because it seems she dosesnt want to meet my family ever again. Every time when smb has a birthday or invites me somewhere, she does not want to come.  Sometimes i get no reason or “Im afraid” “i dont even talk to my family” “ I just want to spend time with you” 

The point is that I really love my girlfriend and we talk every day about our future marriage etc. But my mind is not figuring out how to i tell my parents and friends that im married to woman if they have seen him only once? And how im gonna show our kids to my grandparents without mom? I would be greatly satisfied if she would be somewhat accommodating but none. She frankly says that no change. 

For me . At least 2-3 times a year would be totally fine for me. Im just very proud of my girlfriend and want introduce her more to my parents. She sings very well and performs in front of an audience sometimes. And I just feel that i wanna go deeper level on our relationship and 

I also see my fault. First thing is that first meetings with my mom I feel that it could have been introduced her better+(carry on a conversation at the dinner table) so that I wouldn’t not been that akward. And yeah the second thing is the last time she saw my family i was little bit busy grilling a steak and she was alone a little bit and my family was talking in the other room. I extremely regret my mistake for not being next to him every second because it was just third time being there. My mom is happy and overall kind person but yeah last time she was tired of work when my gf was last time there. She was asking questions mainly from me at the dinner table not about my gf.  I feel that I can't direct the conversation and make people communicate at that moment. And third thing is that i think i pressure her to much and making it even worse.


For more context

I get along with her parents and her young siblings. In fact. I really want to spend more time with them but she doesent want becasuse her younger siblings want to play with me and show everything and yes i undestand that our (limited time for two of us) passes. So my gf is the oldest in her family but im the youngest son and my sisters/ brothers are 30+ yr old.  She also said that its easier for me to meet her parents because young siblings less pressure. Okay its true but…


We have discussed this problem almost a year now and I listened her side. Sometimes she just tries redirect to new topic when im worried about this. 


What can i do in this situation? <——————-

Am i too intrusive with my family? Yeah i offer her to meet my family once a month in hope that on day she’ll change:(( Yeah i feel my mistakes but im worried that she doesn’t give me any change anymore. II m sure that more we spend time with my family. The easier it will become..


So i want to start the problem that he takes my plans on how to improve this situation seriously, not to cut himself out of it completely without giving me a any chance

Truth is, I don’t hate him - but I don’t love him either. Even before their divorce, he was not that present. Now that I had lost my dear mom, I wish not to have another parent and accepted that I will get by without one from then on. There’s also nothing to reconcile. I don’t hold any grudge. I also don’t have the emotional capacity to deal with another matter now that I’m still grieving over my mom’s passing.

He only admits to the full truth after I confront him repeatedly. He recently promised to be fully honest after I discovered their relationship was too close, but I caught him hiding interactions again. He says he hides things out of fear of losing me, but I’m at my breaking point. I love him and want to trust him, but I can’t shake the feeling there’s always more he’s not telling me. How do I move forward and believe him?

My husband and I have been together for 9 years (7 of those married). For the most part, he’s an amazing partner and dad, but there have been repeated issues with dishonesty throughout our relationship, first around hiding porn, and now an emotional affair with a younger female coworker.

The biggest problem for me isn’t necessarily what he does but that every single time, it takes days or weeks to pull the full truth out of him. He’s a terrible liar (I can tell when he’s lying), but he’s somehow great at hiding things and denying them until I corner him. For me, honesty is non-negotiable because of past trauma, but every time I find out something, it’s like peeling layers off an onion—there’s always more underneath.

The latest issue involves this younger coworker, “C”. They’ve gotten closer than what’s normal for other coworkers. I’ve found out bit by bit that he’s deleted messages, brought her coffee, shared personal details about our life, and been more willing to help her than anyone else in his office. He claims nothing physical has happened, and I really want to believe that, but it’s so hard when there’s always something he didn’t tell me until I pry it out.

We had a huge confrontation where he swore he would be fully honest and even had a conversation with her to set boundaries. Things were good for a few weeks, and I tried to trust him. But just last week, I found out they were alone together again—something he didn’t tell me despite promising he would.

He says he’s scared of losing me, which is why he hides things, but I feel like this is a never-ending cycle. I love him, he’s my best friend, and we were even going through fertility treatments for a second child, but this is breaking me. I’ve asked him for full transparency, but I feel like there’s always more he’s not telling me. He’s signed up for therapy and is trying, but I don’t know how to move on if I can’t trust him.

How do I know if he’s really being honest now? How do I rebuild trust when he has such a pattern of hiding things until he’s forced to admit them? I don’t want to constantly question him, but I’m exhausted and don’t know if I can do this anymore. Any advice on how to move forward and believe him would be greatly appreciated.

If I’m slacking with housework because I’ve been working late or life just happens, he moans at me that the house is a mess. Mess being a few dishes and two piles of clean laundry needing folded and put away.

For his birthday recently, he hadn’t asked for anything specific so I got a few bits and bobs he was needing and picked out some clothes from his favourite clothes shop and some more from another shop he doesn’t really shop in. It was inoffensive things that suited his general style and looked really good on him. He opened the presents and huffed and puffed saying “I could go nuts, I don’t know why you’ve bought this” as he was frustrated that it was not things he maybe would have picked for himself. One thing he opened he said “they’ll do”, another thing he said “I’ll think about it”. Once everything was opened he said “thanks” in an almost sarcastic tone. 

Maybe we’re just different people but if I knew someone had spent time, money and effort to get me something, I’d show a lot more appreciation and rightly or wrongly, even if I didn’t love it, probably wouldn’t tell them. Or would be very gentle in how I said it. 

Feeling unappreciated is just starting to get to me. How do other people react in these situations?

So going to be a long one so buckle up. Me and her me [M] have been together for about 8 years now. We connect great on a lot of things, a few things could be better but basic relationship stuff. So thing we're good the first 2 years id say, we were fun and flirty and messed around even with the roommates around. But then it just kinda stopped. To be fair my big reason for stopping was because she's a pillow princess. We are both over weight and she has horrible back issues due to an accident early in life. 
 
So basically the bed room was boring but she was my first relationship, not my first sexual encounter or anything but first real partner. So it's been tough and boring, not only that but I could use a lil extra help getting ""there"" but she never helps me. Every single time we have had sex I get myself there and then finish. And that just kinda sucks. Iv checked and she's happy, she's giggling and having a good time basking in the afternoon glow but I do all the work and my own reward ? So I stopped bringing it up but the thing is she never, never made a move for us to go to the bed room after I stopped.

 So flash forward 6 years, roommates come and go, moving, big life changes and tough times made it easy to just put that issue on the back burner and just think "" we just don't have time"". Don't get me wrong, got the last like 4 years every few months I brought up her going back on birth control and being intimate which usually ended in wierd fights. I have talked to her, my friends and some therapists, and I just feel like I'm not sexually satisfied. I ha r made changes in my life as the last few months, I have gotten in shape, dropped 50+ pounds and am at the gym, I do more around the home and try with her. We finally had a break through and had sex one evening a few weeks ago and I knew it was going to be rough. It's been years but I was happy it was happening. But during it I just remembered all the reasons I was unhappy with it before. She tried talking to me after and I didn't know what to say which want great and we argued about that later but got better. 

 Since then we haven't really talked about it or tried again, she says she doesn't like to do it when our roommates here so timing sucks and that pretty much only leaves weekends open if we are lucky. I'm at a point where I'm wondering if I'm way over reacting with being so unhappy with my partner I'm the bedroom, iv been transparent with her 100%, and she says she's willing to try what if like to, I have kinks I eould like to try, but the energy I get from her is more of someone there for a rife along then a actual interested individual. You know what I mean? Like I want a woman that hungers for me as much as I do her but I don't get that from her. 
 
I just feel lost in my life and feel like I'm looking at a grass is greener kinda situation. Please if love some feed back but no dead bedroom screaming nonsense or telling me to bail now. I love her and want things to work I just feel confused and need to sort things out.


TL;DR! Should I move on at this point t because sex and intimacy sucks with my partner or stay and continue after so long ?",2024-11-11 06:12:38
relationships,1gnzsza,My (19M) girlfriend (18F) told her friend things about our intimate life. How do I go on from now?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnzsza/my_19m_girlfriend_18f_told_her_friend_things/,30,"Hey everyone,

so a few days in a conversation we had my girlfriend of 3 years told me that she has told her friend things about our intimate life. While i per say dont really care if she tells her friend (18F) that we have an intimate life, i do kind of care what she tells her friends. In this particular case, she told her friend exact things about our intimate life, including things like my size.

I am a bit conflicted on how to feel. On one side, I dont want to care because i dont know her friend nor do I care that she talks about it to her friend. On the other side, I am a bit upset she told her friend such personal things like my size. (Im not embarrassed about my size, its quite the opposite)

I am unsure if i had mentioned that exact boundary to her before, tho I have mentioned that i didnt care if she talked about our intimate life as long as its not too detailed. I believe she told me before that she doesnt want me to talk about our intimate life at all, which i obviously respected.

TLDR: Girlfriend told her friend intimate things like my size and i am conflicted on how to feel.",2024-11-10 12:40:59

He started canceling plans we had together or canceling other plans when noticing that this new person was not attending, also, he stopped texting as we would every now and then just to check on each other. 
I’ve realized they might have more in common because they come from the same country but I feel like I’ve been ditched and all I can think about is to move on and stop trying to reach out. Should I just consider him as my friend any more?

relationships,1gn4zmn,I (41M) feel bad for lying to my wife (39F) about my sexual past. We've been married for 9 years and I don't know how to ever bring it up.,460,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gn4zmn/i_41m_feel_bad_for_lying_to_my_wife_39f_about_my/,138,"Our first date night was very drunken and stupid, and during so, I don't know why, but I told her that I had only slept with 3 people. 

This is a lie I have kept for our entire life together. Like, we met when I was 29 and she was 27. And she had thought this the entire time. We have four kids together now. 

And it would be one thing if I had slept with a normal amount of people, but I worked as a security guard at a club for maybe 15 months, and during that time I slept around a large amount. Probably like 30 women and I had 4 encounters with men (idk to call it sex, there was no penetration). 

Its always been something I've felt bad about but never actually found the right time to tell my wife about. We had discussed old ex-girlfriends, I had one when I was 12 (I know, weird) to 20 and then from 24 to 27, but she did not know about anything besides that. 

She recently had this weird rant about how she finds people who sleep around a lot in a short period of time to be insecure or/and sad. I was just sort of nodding along, and she said to me basically that we 'wouldnt know' what its like because its a whole lifestyle we never were exposed to. I basically agreed awkwardly.

It felt extraordinarily weird. You have to understand, I never lie to my wife, and so this lie weighs on me really heavily, and its one thing to KEEP it from her... but in that night where I had to react to her talking about it, it felt extra horrible. 

  
Its weird, because I don't often think about that very brief part of my life. It was a blur of drugs and partying and mindless sex. Its almost strange how well I was able to compartmentalize that aspect of my life into my past. But our conversation that night... that was the real first time I ever straight up lied to her face. I feel horrible about it. 

  
What do I do? How do I tell her the truth? I feel terrible. I have never had a situation like this. There's never been anything besides this that I have ever had to 'come clean' about. I don't even know where to begin. 

  
TL;DR - - wife said stuff about people who sleep around a lot being sad or insecure, and I nodded along. But secretly I slept around a ton when I worked as a security guard. I never lie to my wife, and I want to come clean about this, and I don't know how.

relationships,1go4xlw,Normal to feel anxiety early on in relationship?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go4xlw/normal_to_feel_anxiety_early_on_in_relationship/,5,"
TLDR: I (F 23) am now two months into my first real relationship (M 26). My boyfriend is an absolutely incredible person, and there is genuinely nothing I dislike about him so far. He is very emotionally stable and intelligent, and overall a very healthy person to be with. We’ve already admitted feeling deep love for each other, and at times, we have both admitted to seeing a future together. 
BUT I’ve been having really intense anxiety about the relationship for a couple of weeks now and I’m not exactly sure why. I think it’s partially because I have felt like there are more moments now that we don’t exactly “click”, but I don’t know if that’s a normal part of being in a relationship. Or if that’s just my anxiety preventing me from being able to “click” with him. Or maybe there’s something else going on. 
I’m looking to hear about other people’s experiences early on in their relationship and whether it is “normal” to feel the anxiety that I am feeling right now.

For more context:
Again, this is my first real relationship with someone (this is also his first real relationship with someone), and for the first six or seven weeks, it was going so amazingly well. I’ve dated around a little bit in the past, but no one ever felt quite “right”, or there were plenty of red flags that appeared after a few weeks of dating. When I ended it with the previous guys, I always felt confident in my decision, even if it still hurt quite a bit.
Now I am with my first boyfriend, and for the first month and a half, everything has been going so amazingly well. Our first two weeks were entirely over phone call as I was finishing up a seasonal position on the other side of the country, and then we met in person for the first time on my drive home. Now we live two hours away, and I have driven up to visit/stay with him in his city many times. In total, we’ve probably spent at least three weeks in person together. When we can’t be together in person, we call or face time at least once a day. 

For that first 1.5 months, everything felt so “right” with him. This was the first time I’ve ever felt that kind of “right-ness” about someone. I was still so cautious because of past dating experiences and in general, I am a very cautious person. But for the first time, I could see a potential future with someone.

He is an absolutely wonderful person (so kind, generous, emotionally intelligent, funny, etc.), and there is genuinely nothing bad about him that I can say. We have so many similar interests and experiences, and I have felt so compatible and comfortable with him. He is such a healthy person for me to be in a relationship with and I have been so happy to have him in my life for the past many months. We have both felt such genuine love for each other and told each other “I love you”, and we have both admitted to each other that this feels like a forever relationship. 

But in the past two weeks, I have felt intense anxiety about the relationship.  Maybe it’s because we (or maybe just me) are breaking out of the rose-colored glasses. honey-moon phase, but there have been more times recently that I feel like something just doesn’t click when we’re together, and I don’t feel that unwavering love for him and enthusiasm about our future that I felt earlier on. (I know that he still feels very strongly about me, us, and wanting a future together, and he is not at all hesitant to express his love and care for me.) 

The problem is, I don’t know if I am feeling these feelings because I am suddenly scared of how vulnerable I am becoming with somebody? Or maybe I am just an over-thinker (I definitely am) and my brain is searching for any tiny thing that could lead to hurt in the future? Or maybe the fact that my parents’ divorce completely wrecked their lives for decades? 
Or I’m wondering if maybe a little doubt is normal, and the anxiety I have about that doubt is what is preventing me from feeling other feelings, further spiraling me into more doubt and anxiety.

I’m also wondering if this disconnect/ anxiety I am feeling is a sign the relationship is not going to work or if it is something I should push to work through with him.

I know that relationships aren’t supposed to be perfect and that not every day will be amazing. It’s just hard because I do love him so much, and the thought of losing him from my life is heartbreaking. I genuinely love him and I want for things to work out with him. But the anxiety I’m feeling right now is crippling and preventing me from feeling much else right now.

Anyways I'm definitely still new to driving so I have made a couple mistakes, nothing major though. I started off driving with my dad which went fine, he can give good advice and doesn't scream at me very much. But it's completely different when I drive with my mom, she sometimes screams at me to stop like a while before stop lights and stop signs, or if I go very slightly too close to another lane and I mean literal scream which makes me panic. She also yells last minute directions and gets mad at me when it's too late for me to take them. This makes me not want to drive at all with her because it's dangerous and very stressful. So I've mostly resorted to driving with my dad but due to work reasons this is not often that I get to do it. The problem is, I want to drive, I love it, and I love my mom but it's nearly impossible to drive with my mom. And I need to log 50hrs and I need driving experience for when I test to get my license.

I (24M) am unsure if I can continue with a successful relationship.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go4pdm/my_longdistance_girlfriend_20f_had_an_emotional/,4,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Me and my current girlfriend had met on Tinder, and have been dating for 6 months now. I live in the US, and she lives in the Dominican Republic. Prior to this incident, we never had an argument or a reason to be distrustful of one another. She had suggested that we should be committed to one another after a week of talking. Normally, I wouldn't have trusted such a thing even in a close-distance relationship, but we instantly clicked. I felt as though a leap of faith wouldn't be such a bad thing for once.

About two months into our relationship, she had the idea of swapping Instagram passwords to ""post stories on each other's accounts"". I thought it was a cute idea; maybe a way to alleviate any negative thoughts that may have ever lingered due the distance. As soon as she had gotten into my account, she had commented on dm's with female friends and exes of mine dating years back; not in a negative way, but very tongue-in-cheek for lack of a better term. I never thought about going through her Instagram as soon I had it, but the first thing I noticed was that she only had dm's dating back to 2 weeks prior when we had been together for 2 months. Anything beyond 2 months is understandable. She had dated before me, and it'd be nasty for me to see a dm with a guy she's no longer with. I go to her most recent dm, which was a convo she had with her cousin.

For context: her cousin, (19F) is her best friend, and has known me for the entirety of our relationship. She had even begun referring to me as her brother-in-law. I found a voice note between the two that had shattered me.

GF: ""Girl, I think I'm just going to stay with LowerTheNoise at this point. (other guy) doesn't want a girlfriend, but I never wanted to be his girlfriend to begin with. But hey, we'll see. A gal has got to remain entertained!""

Cousin: ""Wow, quite a setup you've got for yourself there, haha!""

After seeing this, I felt betrayed. I told her over the phone what I had heard, and she had gone from being bubbly to the line going dead silent. She quickly deleted the convo she had with her cousin, and I promptly hung up. The rest of the afternoon was filled with incessant calls and texts. At one point, it even got to threats of self-harm. She even got her mother to call me, and lecture me about causing problems within the relationship. Any attempt to point to my GF's wrongdoing was then deflected. I felt dismissed.

She swore up and down that nothing ever happened between her and that guy. The thing that bothers me is: I don't know if I believe her. She lives in the same remote town as him in the DR. I've visited, and the place doesn't even span a square mile.

She stated that due to us having met on Tinder, she is used to disappointment, and being told sweet things only to be let down in the end. She somehow convinced me to take her back, and has since been very remorseful of the whole thing by deleting her Instagram and her Facebook, and makes it a point to send me videos of what she's doing at all times. She even began to stay in, stating that she prefers to talk to me instead of going out to parties.

It's sweet and all, but it's gotten to a point in the relationship where it feels as though I'm chaperoning her. Now, 6 months in, I feel as though every time she doesn't respond to my texts within the hour, or when she says she's going to run errands. there's always a sliver of doubt embedded in my mind; one that I've never experienced before in any relationship, but one that I feel like will stay with me, regardless of who i end up with.

We still have a strong affinity towards one another. I still feel happy, but sometimes, I also feel wronged. I don't want to build resentment over something like this, but I'm unsure of how I can shake this feeling. I have also verbalized that I don't want her building resentment, and have her feel as though I am robbing her of fun by her choosing to stay at home and talk with me every weekend. She still affirms that it's her own choosing, but I can't help but feel that it is due to guilt.

I've gone and made one trip so far to meet her family. She has also met my family virtually. What do I do?

I’m hoping for some advice because I’m feeling lost and don’t want to make the wrong move here. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost a year now and we are currently in a long-distance relationship for a couple of months now. Usually, we’re in touch daily, calling at least once a day, and he always calls before bed if we couldn’t chat much during the day.

A month ago, he suddenly went silent for three days—no texts, no calls. When we finally spoke, he said he’d been busy with assignments and a music club audition. I wanted to be understanding, but I noticed he was active on social media during that time, so I couldn’t shake the feeling he was avoiding me. He would unsend reels on instagram right after sending them, unlike my tiktok reposts right after liking them and delete his chats right after before I could read them. A day later, he confessed that he was struggling with depression, and the only reason why he was confessing was just because I wouldn’t get the wrong idea and that he wanted space. 

It’s been a month since then and we’ve barely talked. The only times we’ve connected were two brief calls when he asked me to wake him up—no real conversations, no check-ins. A few days ago, after having a few drinks, I asked him why he’s been so distant, even questioning if he was pushing me away or cheating. He told me he wasn’t cheating, that he’s been pushing his mom and grandma away too, and that he just wants to handle things on his own. He keeps saying he doesn’t want to be vulnerable with anyone and feels like he can’t give me what I deserve, and that if I wanted to break up, he’d understand, but I told him I’d wait, even though he said that it might take a while.

I feel like I’m selfish for wanting him to open up to me because I can’t tell if I’m offering just for my own peace of mind. But I genuinely want to support him—I don’t know what changed, because he was opening up to me before he left and even right after he first moved away. I feel hypocritical for saying that I wouldn’t wait for him but sending drunk text asking him not to push me away. Even more so when I see him online on discord playing games with his friends till 4am, or posting stories on his instagram of his life just here and there. I do want him to be happy, I want him to spend time with his friends, but why can’t I also be a part of his life right now? It’s also hard because this month is our anniversary, which just makes the silence hurt even more.

I want to respect his space, but this silence is really painful, and I’m unsure about where I stand.  For those who’ve been in similar situations, how do you handle wanting to support a partner who insists on dealing with things alone? What’s the best way to be there for him without feeling like I’m pressuring him to be vulnerable? And how can I manage my own feelings of hurt and frustration without making him feel guilty?

TL;DR: My (22F) boyfriend (23M) and I are in a long-distance relationship, and he’s barely talked to me in a month. He says he’s been busy and doesn’t want to be vulnerable with anyone, even telling me that if I wanted to break up, he’d understand. I want to support him, but his silence is painful, especially since this is our anniversary month. How can I respect his need for space without feeling hurt, and how do I balance wanting to be there for him without pressuring him to open up?",2024-11-10 12:50:02
relationships,1go3s13,My Mom's Boyfriend ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go3s13/my_moms_boyfriend/,3,"Hey reddit,

My [24M] mom [52F] has being dating her boyfriend [60M] for over a year now. Let's call him ""Ed"" 

I am genuinely happy for her and it's been warming my heart to see her in a seemingly happy relationship. I have met Ed on numerous occasions since I live with my Mom at the moment to kill off some student loans and save for an apartment/home. If I'm being brutally honest, the guy seems super nice and extremely considerate. From what I've seen, he seems like a great guy with good intentions. 


Although, last night the dynamic changed a bit. He got her a promise ring (not an engagement ring) to show his commitment to her. So, obviously things are getting more serious. The thing that makes me most worried the most about my mom's relationship is the possibility of her getting betrayed and hurt again. 

A couple years ago, my mom ended her 27 year marriage with my dad [54M]. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when my dad lied about working and stole some college funds from me to cover it up. She felt extremely betrayed and it clearly hurt her alot. I just don't want to see her go through that again. It also left some serious mental wounds to me and my sisters [27F] and [16F]. So, I'm definitely a little cautious about the possibility of something like this happening again. Ed has never given me that vibe, but my dad never did until he did the action. 

To make things even more awkward, My dad moved 1,000 miles away since he couldn't afford his apartment and the nearest family willing to support him lives that far. Since then, I felt like I've carried more of the responsibility for making sure my little sister has someone looking out for her emotionally since her worlds been turned so much these past few years.

My mom and Ed go out frequently and she works many hours as a teacher on week days. So she gets pretty busy. Not in any neglectful way, but it's definitely hard to be a parent, date, work, and cook. So I definitely try to make sure to include my little sister when I can. 

I'm conflicted if I should say anything about my anxiety over the situation. Personally, I feel like unless the guy is clearly bad news, I'm going to largely accept who she wants in her life. Because it's her life and I just want her to be happy as her son.

TDLR: My mom's boyfriend who has dated her for over a year gave her a promise ring. While I am happy for her, I'm just extremely cautious about it since I don't want to see her getting hurt in another relationship. Is this a normal feeling? and should I say something to my mom about my anxiety over this situation?

relationships,1gnyyoh,I (22F) want to move out of my flatshare with my other roommate because my friend is horribly unclean. How to do that without hurting her?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnyyoh/i_22f_want_to_move_out_of_my_flatshare_with_my/,4,"
I (22F) live in a flatshare with my best friend B (21F) and two other roommates, Q and T. B and I clicked right away when we met in college, so when we needed a place to stay, we decided to move in together. Q and I quickly became close friends, and we both share similar views on housework and creating a cozy home. T and I had issues in the beginning, especially with his loud girlfriend practically living with us, which caused sleepless nights. Things improved after a big talk, but it left some tension.

The Problem:
The main issue now is B’s messy habits. She often leaves dirty dishes and food out, which has caused a food moth and fly problem. I’ve tried to minimize it by buying cleaning supplies, but she doesn’t seem to care. We’ve spoken to her about cleaning up, but nothing has improved. On top of that, she lied to me about breaking the stovetop. I understand she might have been embarrassed, but I always try to create a safe space for open and honest communication, which makes the dishonesty harder to handle.

B does the bare minimum around the house, like vacuuming and cleaning our tiny bathroom, while Q and I end up doing most of the real work. B also complains about small things, like me not buying a more expensive brand of olive oil for us to share. She sometimes seems jealous of my friendship with Q, which adds to the tension.

While I’m friends with all my roommates, they aren’t friends with each other, so I feel like I’m the one holding everything together emotionally. I also manage the cleaning schedule and the flat’s overall organization. Most of the furniture and decor are mine or things I helped bring in.

My Dilemma:
I want to move to a more central part of the city because my commute is much longer than my roommates’. Q and I are planning to find a new flatshare together, where we can choose people who share our lifestyle. I still love B as a friend, and I love our hangout sessions in the evenings, but I don’t see us working as roommates anymore. Resentment is building up, and I worry it could damage our friendship if I stay.

At the same time, I’m concerned that B will feel betrayed if I move out, especially since Q is coming with me. However, I believe that moving out will ultimately help our friendship since the living situation is becoming a source of frustration.

What I Need Help With:
How can I move out with Q without hurting my relationship with B? I want to preserve our friendship, but I don’t think continuing to live together is sustainable.

**TL;DR: My friend never cleans up after herself and my whole flat relies on me to keep things together both emotionally and organizationally. I want to move out but I think she would be incredibly betrayed by that.**",2024-11-10 11:49:06
relationships,1go2r60,Can I make this argumentative relationship work?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1go2r60/can_i_make_this_argumentative_relationship_work/,2,"TLDR//: My boyfriend and I haven’t stopped arguing since we brought our house a year ago and now we’ve both lost feelings for each other, are never intimate and currently going through counselling but we just don’t feel the same. Is it fixable?

So I (24F) do love my boyfriend (29M) but I can’t lie, not as much as I used to. We used to absolutely adore each other, couldn’t see a future with anyone else and wanted to start that future by buying a house together after 2 years being together.

Honestly the first day of moving in is when the arguments started. He is so precious about the house being spic and span, spotless etc and because I have 2 large breed dogs and I’m not a clean freak he has found anything and everything to have a go at me for. He got into an awful row with me over me not opening letters the second they came through the door. I put them on the side for a couple of hours whilst I relaxed (I’d just got home from work) and he told me I’ve got nothing going for me because I can’t look after myself let alone a house, and that I’m a little girl not a woman etc which I thought was just so extreme I had to leave the house for a few hours and cried in my car with my dogs. He’s literally wiped his finger across the windowsill before and kicked off into a full blown argument because it was dusty and told me I was a liar for saying I’d cleaned the house, when I did actually spend 3 hours cleaning the house before he got home from work I just forgot to dust the windowsills :’).

We are currently going through couples counselling and to be honest we’re only 2 sessions in but I just don’t feel like complimenting him everyday like she’s told us to do, and I don’t want to be around him really. I don’t even want to sleep in the same bed as him and I really believe it’s because of how he’s made me feel during arguments. He will find any reason to argue with me and when he brings up something that’s bothering him, he gets so angry as he’s talking about it and starts swearing that he just naturally creates an argument. Both me and the counsellor have told him to stop being so direct and just talk but he can’t seem to do that. And I don’t like being spoken to like a child.

My parents hate him because of how he’s made me feel and the fact he doesn’t treat me how they believe I should be treated (which I believe the same way). My dad has always looked after my mom and could never do enough for her even tho she is awfully independent and has that “doesn’t need a man” vibe but he will always do everything he can for her. That’s how I believe my relationship should be too, and with previous boyfriends it has been but this one is super against doing anything for me if I can do it myself, which I can but that’s not the point. He brought himself a car and put £4000 deposit down when he knows I’ve been needing a van for my new job which is literally £4000. I get it’s his money etc, but I see it as we live together and we both have the same goals in life. Why hasn’t he seen that situation as “she needs a van for work and I don’t NEED to part X my car so I’ll buy her a van” you know? That’s exactly what I would do for him if I had the money.

Not sure what to do. I don’t like the idea of splitting up considering how in love we once were, but we’re not even sleeping together and I can’t even imagine kissing him anymore because whenever I’ve tried he’s always tightened his lips so tight that I feel he doesn’t even want to kiss me. He’s rejected me in bed on numerous occasions and told me he’s just tired so I’ve stopped trying and now he’s noticed I’ve stopped trying and is blaming me for not trying anymore even though he doesn’t? It’s so exhausting. I want a better life for me and my dogs but I don’t know if that can be with him?

relationships,1gnyh7s,"Found out my boyfriend lied about his breakup timeline, and now his ex and roommate are stirring up serious drama—Is this a setup or a red flag",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnyh7s/found_out_my_boyfriend_lied_about_his_breakup/,4,"**TL;DR**: My (21F)  boyfriend, Curt (24M) hid parts of his breakup timeline with his ex, Bella (26F), leading to some overlap when he and I started dating. Bella is in contact with his roommate, Eliot(25M), and posted anonymously about Curt cheating during their relationship. She provided me with screenshots suggesting he was seeing both of us briefly, while Curt’s friend Tina warned me Bella can be obsessive and vengeful. Eliot seems to be taking Bella’s side, and there’s drama on all sides. I’m ending things with Curt due to the lies, but I’m curious if Bella and Eliot are working together to get revenge on him, or if Curt’s really as bad as they claim.

My (21F) boyfriend Curt (24M) (names changed) and I have been together for a few months. Recently, we found out his ex, Bella(26F), is in contact with his roommate, Eliot(25M), and started to ask about Curt's life, the roommate gave away about our rp and my details and has started following me on social media. Though she didn’t reach out to me directly, I had a gut feeling and checked some local FB groups about unfaithful partners. I found an anonymous post about Curt, showing his Tinder profile (which I knew about, though he deleted the app), with claims that he’d cheated on Bella in the end of their 2.5-year relationship. Most comments dismissed it as a jealous ex’s revenge, though one person claimed to have met Curt on a Tinder date last month (no clear proof, so could be fake). A female colleague of Curt’s defended him in the comments anonymously, saying he’s a good guy and mentioned Bella had even contacted her too.

I ended up messaging Bella for more details. She admitted to making the post and sent me screenshots from girls who’d sent her proof of Curt’s past texts  from months before they broke up. She also shared some texts/gallery screenshots between her and Curt from around the time he and I started dating. Curt had originally told me he’d broken up with Bella a year ago, but he later admitted it was actually around May, with some contact until July. Bella’s screenshots suggest they were in touch into August-September, overlapping with when Curt and I first started seeing each other. This makes it seem like he was lying to both of us at first and only cut things off with her for good once he had me.

I talked to Eliot, who said he’d heard Curt and Bella fighting, and implied Curt hadn’t changed much since they were children. He also mentioned that Bella had stayed over just the day before I first came to Curt’s place in September. But there were no other girls after me. Eliot has since backed off, saying he doesn’t want to be involved in any drama, he deleted his texts “for privacy reasons.” He also didn't admitted about telling Curt about me and Bella being in contact. But Curt told that he knows.  Finally in the evening Bella contacted police to give them some information about Curt, as a psychological abuser. She sent me the screenshot of the message receives from police.   
Meanwhile, Curt asked me to speak with another girl, Tina, for “perspective on Bella.” Tina explained that Bella has stalked her for years since she also once dated one of Bella’s exes. Bella allegedly harassed Tina even after her breakup, coming to events Tina organized, to talk badly about her ex. Tina warned me to be cautious with Bella, but said it’s up to me to decide if I trust Curt.

So, here are my main takeaways:

* Curt definitely lied to me at the beginning of us dating and probably to Bella as well, overlapping us for a month or so.
* Bella and Eliot both paint Curt as aggressive and dishonest, but Curt and Tina describe Bella as obsessive and vengeful.
* Bella didn't provide some proof on the days she said she met Curt, allegedly she deleted all the chats with him. The alignment on Curt meeting her as well was mainly August. We became official with Curt on September, around the time Curt and Bella allegedly broke up.
* Curt has never shown aggression with me, and in recent months, we’ve been together almost every night, he is caring, attentive boyfriend to me. But I know it might turn worse over time.

**My main question is:** could Bella and Eliot be working together to get revenge on Curt or should I take it as true?  
It’s hard to know what’s true, and I plan to check Curt’s phone when I return to town soon, to get some closure. I’m at a point where I don’t want to continue this relationship given all the drama.",2024-11-10 11:16:16

The story begins like this: I left a relationship of 7 and a half years with a girl, let's call her D33, with whom I had a relationship with ups and downs, I went through 3 breaks and the 4th time I took a break but she decided that there was no point in continuing because it hurt me more from her perspective. It all started in the 3rd break when she put her password on the phone and won't let me see anything and I started to have insecurities about the relationship and she started going out more and etc., things I don't I was used to it because during the 2-week break I suffered quite a lot and then, noticing these things, I felt even more strange and confused about the relationship. It all started because I didn't ask her all this time and she doesn't know what I'm thinking. After the break I met G20, with whom I get along very well and she satisfies all my desires, she is beautiful, only she is very suffocating, if it were after her she would lock me in the house and I would stay with her all day. He gets angry if I want to spend time with my family or I want to go out without her with friends, etc., we don't argue, he accepts me as I am but the bad part is that I miss D33, then he sent me a message about how I am and if I wanted to go out for a coffee and since then he has turned me upside down. The point is that there have been times when I miss the D33, but why do I tend to leave the G20 for the D33? I don't know what to choose, I don't know what to do, I consume so much... If there is someone with experience and could give me some advice or an idea. I tend to go back to D33...

I was in a bad place with myself and didn't allow myself to move things forward with her or commit to her. She moved on and started seeing someone else. Totally my fault.

We still talk from time to time as friends, last night we spoke on the phone for half an hour and I told her how I'm working on myself and stuff like that. Nothing inappropriate and she isn't hiding the fact we talk from her new partner.

But I want her back In my life and I feel like an asshole and selfish for it, but we were really good together and it took her leaving for me to realize everything I did wrong and everything I gave up with her. What do I do. Can I try and get her back or at least tell her plainly, ""i want another chance with you, I want you in my life again""? Or do i just leave it alone and wait and see what happens.

relationships,1goc6t6,Why did my [36F] sister [32F] stop talking to me all together and block me?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goc6t6/why_did_my_36f_sister_32f_stop_talking_to_me_all/,34,"I am the second oldest of four in my family. I have two younger sisters. The third kid, my sister, and I never really got along great growing up but we were okay with each other. In fact, we even hung out at a bar or restaurant a few times during our 20s. She is about 4 years younger than me. She got married a little more than 7 years ago and is a mom now. She knew that I was desperate to have kids and marry, and I think she carried that pity for me with her. 

For a while, I avoided my family all together and ceased all contact with them. I will admit I was mad and disappointed in them because they excluded me from some family events, such as a few of my cousin's weddings where I was literally the only extended family member not invited. They claimed that they did not agree with our cousin's decision, didn't think it was right, but at the same time respected that it is my cousin's prerogative who they want to invite, and so my parents and siblings attended these cousins weddings anyway. Then my parents got mad at me when I dare tried to complain about it later, said to never bring it up again because they were tired of hearing me constantly complain about it and tried to start trouble with them. I was also kept out of the loop on baby news each time both of those female cousins each had their kids. I feel like my family did it because they pity me and feel sorry for me, since I have all kinds of health issues that makes it very difficult to have kids, and I haven't had a serious partner. A while ago, when I was still in my '20s, my parents also told me that they don't think I should have kids, I'm not ready, I shouldn't even think about it if I am nowhere near getting married, and all this other stuff that just made me feel bad about myself. So I stopped talking to my family for a good two or three years, then interacted with them politely and minimally, and at various points distance myself again

However, that is more with my parents than my siblings. When I did start interacting regularly with my family again, around 3 years ago, I will admit I did block everybody temporarily on social media when my parents still didn't seem to want me around at the holidays despite us all talking again, but I apologized to my siblings afterward, explained what happened, and unblocked them. I thought things were okay with my sister and I. When me and my sisters, my sister-in-law, and many others all gathered together at a wedding shower for one of our cousins, I express to my sister how I hope that when I get married or have a baby someday, that they all come to my shower too, that it would mean a lot to me. My sister acted supportive of this and said she would definitely be there for me. But then a few weeks later, I realized that I had been blocked by my sister. When I tried texting her, she flat out ignored me. When a siblings had a get together involving meeting for dinner at TGI Fridays, apparently my sister told my other siblings that she could not attend. I found out later that apparently she canceled because she found out I was going to be there. And then she met up with the other two siblings at the same restaurant a week later when I wouldn't be there. This almost has me feeling like kids of divorced parents, who have two separate holiday celebrations, one with each parent so the parents don't have to be around each other or interact. 


I don't know what I did wrong to my sister, especially since everything seemed so perfectly normal and great with us when I last hung out with her at our cousin's wedding shower 2 years ago. To this day she refuses to talk to me. When there are few family get togethers where we were both there, she literally did not say a single word to me. She acted as if I was completely invisible. When I tried to say hi to her or ask her a question, she literally acted like I was not even there. Totally ignored me. I have brought this up to each of our parents and they keep telling me to get over it, they can't force her to like someone or talk to someone, they don't know what happened, but to get over it. They have not been helpful at all. 


I wrote in another post about bad terrible stuff that was posted on me online by a toxic jerk guy M. Given how judgmental and snooty my sister has always been, do you think that maybe she found that stuff posted online about me and that's the real reason she hasn't wanted to talk to me? Do you think she is embarrassed of me being her sister because of the stuff she found online? I also question if a previous boss found it too and maybe that's a real reason I was one of three selected to be forced transferred to another branch in the company, even though I had stellar performance reviews before that. What do you think? 

Also, should I try to make amends one last time or should I not bother? 

TL/DR: My younger sister started ignoring me completely and blocking me on everything about 2 years ago and I have no idea why. Any attempt to talk to her at family functions has been met with her seeing straight through me and ignoring me as if I am not even there. When I ask my parents, they get hostile with me and tell me to get over it, that they can't force her to be friends with me. I question if bad stuff posted online about me by a toxic x is the real reason she wrote me off, because she is ashamed of me. What do you think? And what should I do?

relationships,1gnvqr4,I (F30) have an issue with my partner's (M35) actions involving me ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnvqr4/i_f30_have_an_issue_with_my_partners_m35_actions/,2,"
The reason I feel awful is because when I opened our tablet, the screen showed my boyfriend's Reddit inbox messages page. I never look at his account and we don't even know eachother usernames. I have a glimpse at the messages and at the top there was a reply to his comment to the post that was posted a week ago about a fight between two peopl.

He wrote in his comment:
""She (the woman from the post) definitely seems to have trust issues from her past relationships and find it difficult to trust you right now. My girlfriend had ugly relationships too before me and can behave the same way as yours. And although I love her, it's exhausting sometimes"".

What made me angry at first was that he speaks as if I had trust issues because of my past but actually he was the one in our relationship that was lying and cheating at the start till 5 months into it. That made it definitely difficult for me to trust him the same as before.

He mentioned also this was his first comment about me ever on Reddit. So he made something up about me specifically to get attention (I assume) and besides that it's very negative as a whole.

Yesterday I discussed this with him and asked for what reason. He said he doesn't know why he did it. But felt a need to feel a victim. Also he didn't read all the 4 screenshots of the post which sounds untrue. Unfortunately, he was very tired and laying in bed, gave a reply because he saw similarities between me and that woman. He never followed the sub Reddit before so he said that it was a coincidence it appeared on his feed. That same night he acted sweet and touchy. So I wasn't aware that he had these feelings at all.

On a last note I want to add that apparently my boyfriend have made up a big lie and told this to some of his close friends. We where only together for like 4-5 months and I hadn't met these friends yet. Almost 1,5 year ago, he ranted to his friends about breaking up with me but if he would do so then I would call the police and make up some shit about him.

One of his friends started me to tell about this situation and asked me if it was true. I'm glad to know the story but at the same time I feel an idiot to have loved him from the beginning and feeling in love while he talked this way to his friends for no reason. It's a long time ago and I've forgive him but because of this post and his reply I began to see ""his similarities"" from the past and the current.

Asking for advice: I'm curious to know how other people would handle these situations or what would feel as the right thing to do? Not just to vent. 

Should I speak up for myself and tell those friends I never had a part in that story about threating with police to him or let it be and don't dig it up?

TL;DR: questioning myself how to approach the situation where my partner tells lies about me towards his social circle.

Not sure where to really begin here. I have been with my fiancé for a little over 9 years now and I have been dealing with difficult feelings surrounding our relationship. After being together for so long, it’s become apparent that he has no real interest in progressing (as a person, in life, financially, physically, etc.) I met him when we were both much younger and stuck with him through the tough times. When we met, he had absolutely no goals or ambition. I had to teach him basic things like picking a career and taking care of himself hygiene wise. I saw his kind soul and fell in love with him despite all of these things. We worked together and built a decently comfortable life. I am nowhere near where I want to be financially, but he refuses to learn a new skill or up his game to help us. It seems that he is comfortable living exactly how we are now, and that scares me as I’m not yet 30 and would like to experience more out of life. He no longer puts effort into planning dates, surprising me with sweet gestures, or overall doing his share. I feel that I pull the weight in the relationship despite communicating this many times. I’m terrified to leave this relationship behind because I’ve invested so much time and energy into it. Our lives our so intertwined in every way. His family is amazing and treats me as one of them, something I have never had before. Our finances are totally combined as well, so if I were to leave I’m not sure how that would shake out. I guess my question is should I stay in hopes that things get better/I fall back in love with him, or should I end things and work on building the life I’ve always wanted? I have a huge fear that if I leave I will regret it and lose the person I love. But at the same time this deep feeling of dissatisfaction is eating away at me. Help please!

relationships,1gnmadf,Was I too insecure and jealous?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnmadf/was_i_too_insecure_and_jealous/,31,"My boyfriend 41-M and I 40-F dated for 9 months and broke up a month ago, but I keep reflecting on one issue that’s hard to let go of: his very close friendship with a female friend. I know we’re over, and there’s no going back, but I can’t shake the question of whether I was being too insecure or if my instincts were actually trying to tell me something important.

When my ex and I connected on Facebook, I noticed a few pictures of him with this friend 48-F. I asked if they were dating, and he replied, “Definitely not, she’s my best friend.” I trusted him and didn’t think much of it. But a few months into dating, I finally met her in person. He invited me, her, and her friend over for St. Patrick’s Day. By then, I knew they’d been friends for years, and he was close with her family and friends.

After the gathering, I asked how they met. That’s when he finally admitted they’d met on a dating app 18 years ago, when he first moved from the East Coast to California. They briefly dated but decided to stay friends. He said it had been platonic ever since. When I asked why he didn’t tell me this sooner, he admitted he was afraid I wouldn’t have dated him.

At that point, I told him I was uncomfortable with their history. I asked that they not meet alone or take trips together, as they used to go for romantic-seeming five-course dinners and even took a five-day trip with another friend just before I came into the picture. He agreed to go on one last dinner with her to discuss these boundaries, but he also insisted on an international trip with her and some friends that was coming up in June. Despite nearly ending things over this, he still insisted on going. 

To his credit, he respected my wishes and didn’t see her alone afterward, but he continued hanging out with her friend group regularly. I was invited to some of these gatherings but always felt like an outsider. He was part of her life to a degree that I couldn’t be—invited to all her family events, holiday parties, even her parents’ 50th anniversary. All his friends seemed to be her friends, and all of them were women. The friend has a live-in boyfriend of five years, though he never came to gatherings, and I never met him. 

This friend is very outgoing and loves taking and posting photos, while my ex and I are more introverted. There was one specific photo from New Year’s Eve five years ago (likely before she was with her current boyfriend) that looked particularly affectionate. They were sitting close, looking into each other’s eyes and laughing, with his hand wrapped around her waist. It looked more intimate than any picture I ever took with him, and it made me feel uncomfortable and, yes, jealous.

Looking back, I think I was more affected by their emotional closeness than anything physical. They were so entwined in each other’s lives and had such a deep history that I was never able to reach that level of intimacy with him during our nine months together—and I don’t think I ever could have.

So, Reddit, was I being too insecure and jealous, or were my feelings valid?

We've known each other for a few years, he has always been really sweet and nice towards me.

We got somewhat closer a few months ago, we are both single but we agreed from the get go it was strictly platonic between us.

A few months back we started hanging out more at either mine or his place, and it was really nice. We would talk, eat, watch movies or play games and I really enjoyed that time, and he seemed to do to since he would always find reasons to hang out. We hung out pretty much every weekend. 

We also never crossed any boundaries. Sometimes he would do stuff like pinch my cheek, tickle my ankles or feed me snacks (which aren't the things I'd normally do with an opposite gender friend, but since we agreed when we started hanging out more that it's all platonic, I didn't give it too much thought). I am also generally not a touchy person and don't let people physically close to me easily.

We never argued or anything, I never talked too much about my own problems, if anythinghe was always more talkative one, and enjoyed listening to him. He also never mentioned he was bothered by my topics or that he finds them boring.

Anyways, 2 months ago we hung out, it was a really great night, but towards the end a weird incident happened. Not to go into details, but he was jokingly chasing me around and at one point he got extremely close and well, it kinda shocked me and I said: ""What are you doing?"" Admittedly it sounded a tad more upset than the situation deserved. He backed away but things got kinda tense afterwards so I decided it might be best if I went home to calm down the tension. 

After a few days he texted me and asked to hang out the next day, and said after that he won't be available for the next couple of weeks. When I went there, everythimg seemed normal and we hung out as usual, he even mentioned movies we should watch next etc.

For the next few weeks we texted a bit (nothing more or less than the usual), and after around 3 weeks I asked him if he's free to hang out, but he said he was busy. Which was fine on its own, but I noticed he also started to leave me on seen, respond with dry texts etc, and just in general a lot less contact via texts. For the next two months he never suggested to meet, kept rejecting my invitations (it was maybe three in the dpan of two đonths, I tried not to be pushy), but I saw on his stories that he was hanging out and going out with other people all the time, but if I asked to hang out he would say he doesn't know when he'll be available. I asked him if he was okay and he said he was.

Then 10 days ago, I decided I was done with that behaviour and that I at least wanted to clear the air and know what's going on. So I first asked to see him, he again declined and said he is going out partying, but, unsurprisingly, never offered alternative time.

So I told him: Look, it's pretty obvious to me that you don't want to hang out anymore, but please I would at least like to be told why.

And well, he pretty much unleashed all of his anger at me. He started with: ""Fine! We won't hang out anymore then!"" And continued with telling me that it's my fault cause I'm always overthinking crap, he doesn't want to answer my questions, that he has a life and has better and more fun things to do. He also added that it's my fault that I wanted to hang out all the time before, which I found really hurtful and confusing since he initiated our meetups as often as I did, and would always find silly excuses to meet up, and it felt like shit to make me feel guilty for how much we hung out.

I was so upset after that and I blocked him everywhere for my own peace of mind. 

Yesterday a friend told me he asked a mutual friend about me.

I am so sad atm and I don't know what to do. I am confused because it was just such a shocking change. At some point I thought maybe he started to like me so he was distancing himself, but those last words from him seemed so hateful and purposefully hurtful.

And yeah, before anyone asks, I did like him a lot. But since we agreed initially it was all just friendly, I didn't want to cross any boundaries, hence my reaction that one day.

I'm not even sure if it's worth talking to him or I should just let it go. I'm really hurt because we have been friends for so long, and have always been there for each other. It didn't have to end in such an ugly way.

relationships,1gnlhmb,My(17) GF(18) thinks I don’t care about her because I took to long to eat,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnlhmb/my17_gf18_thinks_i_dont_care_about_her_because_i/,39,"So recently I told my girlfriend that my sister and her boyfriend who i’ve never met would come to our house and my dad would barbecue, she said “why are you telling me this”. I told her it’s because it will probably take a while and you’ve been asking me to tell you more stuff. Our day goes on and we don’t really touch on it anymore

Today (the day my sister was visiting) I told her again, I’ll be eating for a while since my dad is barbecuing, she said “alright”. Now we started at around 6 PM and ended at 11 PM, during that time we were texting and she didn’t seem okay so I was telling her that she can always tell me anything that’s bothering her, she found this weird and I just told her that I care about her and that I find it really important to know what is wrong so I can do my best to make you feel better. She again found this weird and said that I couldn’t do anything about it and that it’s not about me. When 11PM came around we finally stopped and I asked if she wanted to call (we’re long distance). She is insanely mad saying “f off”, “you’re the problem”, “i’ve been waiting 5 f-ing hours and now you’re finally trying to call me”, things like that. I found this weird because I told her a couple days ago that it would take a while? What should I do, I’m honestly baffled at her reaction?

EDIT: I would like to note that I don’t ban her from doing anything, i encourage her to go out because I know she feels better after, she regularly goes to parties. Recently I had a chance to go to a party for the first time in lets say about 1,5 years. My girlfriend was very opposed to this idea and i ended up not going because she doesn’t know the people i go out with, while i know who she goes out with (they were my previous friend group). I don’t think this is a bad argument but I don’t think I’ve left the house since about 8 months ago (excluding work and school)

UPDATE: I can’t say we’ve actually had a conversation but she’s saying she doesn’t think I care about her anymore just from that one barbecue taking too long. I asked her if she really thinks I don’t care about her and she said yes. considering breaking up because what’s the point if there’s no trust

TL;DR My girlfriend is insanely mad at me because I took too long to eat while I informed her it would take a while, what do i do?",2024-11-09 22:16:40
relationships,1gnrxef,I (22M) can’t connect or talk with my mom or her side of the family when I come home. ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnrxef/i_22m_cant_connect_or_talk_with_my_mom_or_her/,3,"Currently laying down in my old room writing this. So I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes. 

Background: To give some context to my life and general family situation. I am a 22 year old guy. My parents, who are both former military, divorced when I was young, probably 5-6ish I generally don’t know cause they’ve been divorced longer than I can remember them ever being together. I have one full sister who is older than me by a couple years and then on both sides of my family I am the middle child. 5 of us on my moms side and 3 of us on my dads side. I was generally left to do my own things growing up because I could handle my own things and was seen as “smart and mature”. I also was very introverted growing up and didn’t really have friends until highschool and only ever got into any kind of mischief then. My mom’s side is very much extroverts who love talking and drinking and smoking weed. My dad’s side is very much more chill and relaxed except for recent years where him and my stepmom became DINKS (Dual Income No Kids). 

My Problem?: I find it hard to connect and talk with my moms side of the family when I go home. I find myself reverting back to how I was when I was growing up, the quiet kid who listens to the rest of them go talk loudly to each other while just being off to the side. It’s weird because I have not nearly as many problems talking with my dad’s side or even talking with my friends/coworkers. I’m not the life of the party but I can carry a conversation. Here at my moms I don’t really like talking and I find myself answering questions they have of me and my job(military) short and to the point. I usually just wait until they go on talking with each other till I can just slip away to my old room and shut the door. The things they usually end up talking about are just about local drama or happenings between them and their friends and not anything I feel like I can contribute to with conversation. It feels like the only things I can say most of the time are “that’s cool” or “oh, wow”.  It’s not that I don’t like them, I love them a bunch even if I don’t really feel connected with them. 

How do I go about changing this to connect with them more?

TL;DR
When I go home I don’t feel like I can talk or connect with my mom’s side of the family. What can I do to keep a good relationship with them even if I can’t connect or relate. ",2024-11-10 03:50:25

can someone help me sort through my emotions? 

i started talking to this guy about a little over a month ago. it’s rare for me to find someone i genuinely like so i get inwardly excited about crushes and people i take interest in, because it’s very hard for me to come across. he has a hand in different business endeavors and steams of income so he’s very busy every day and so am i with my hectic and demanding work schedule but also trying to keep up with taking care of myself. i’m admittedly young minded when it comes to relationships and the concept of love because i’ve never had good examples in my own life when it comes to that. i can definitely be mature in handling situations and managing my emotions i just sometimes need help dissecting them and understanding myself. depending on how stressed out i am it can take me longer to sort through what im feeling which is why im making this post. he doesn’t do anything wrong. he’s a hardworking man. i’m aware that he’s busy and our schedules don’t exactly work the best but he talks to me often and tries to see me as much as he can. what pisses me off is him falling asleep on me all of the time. again, i’m not upset that he’s falling asleep if anything the source of my irritation is simply just the fact that i can’t see him. i think it’s kind of irrational but understandable. he’ll literally text me to come see him and then will fall asleep not even 5 minutes later. it takes a lot of moving things around, rushing, and planning accordingly for me to see him and i don’t think he realizes all of the efforts that i take in trying to spend time with him. i like him, and plan to keep seeing him im just tired of always trying so hard to make time especially when he initiates wanting to see me just for it to be casually dismissed because he falls asleep on me. how can i handle this without coming across as too overbearing or emotionally attached? i don’t want him to feel like im trying to control him or tell him what to do, i just want him to understand where im coming from. i’m 22F and he’s 27M. 

i just want to know how to go about communicating with a new guy i really like when it comes to our hectic schedules and what sometimes feels like him not meeting me halfway. ",2024-11-10 07:24:28

My boyfriend (34M) was in A&E last week. He told me (31F) not to come as there’s no point both of us sat there bored. I saw him the day after and he was telling me about this girl that he was sat with. She was frustrated at the wait and went with him to his scan. He said she would kick his leg to keep him awake so they could talk. She sounded a general nuisance to staff but he thought it was funny. 
They’re now friends on Facebook. She has a super generic name and no last name on there so they must have spoken enough to share those details or mobile number. He’s currently stopping with a family member because of his condition and she’s a local girl. 
Exposing myself here so please be gentle… it’s sent me spiralling. Socials are a bit of a trigger for me. I’ve been in situations where you get chatting but the interaction ends the moment I leave - I have no interest linking with that person again so wouldn’t think of finding a way to stay connected. It feels disrespectful. 
I guess I need some help on how to handle this. I don’t want to get emotional and just be told I’m insecure. We’ve been together a year now.

However both of us are committed to atleast trying our best to make it work and overall there has been good progress but there is one issue that is slowly driving me insane. Very impprtant context moving foward is in terms of selfawareness and social interaction in general im definitely more adapted at it than he is and hes been slowly getting better at it throughbslef reflection and help from me. He is a really silly and laid back person who is always cracking jokes which I really like about him however he can often times have the humor of a 14 yr old boy talking to his friends. he'll say something ik he doesn't mean in a hurtful manner however I cant help but take it as such. For example, we were jokingly saying ""oh u don't love bc of xyz (xyz being some random bs)"" and he saying something along the lines of "" oh u don't love me you won't shake ass"" now I'm fully aware he said this jokingly however as someone who used to be extremely hypersexual as a coping mechanism for the chaos of my life (he is to an extent aware of this)  it struck a chord w me, and when I said hey that's mean he took it as if I was joking and continued to reiterate it. Another example is earlier today he jokingly accused me of cheating and I said I don't think I have it in me to stress over 2 men. He said "" ofc that's what they all say"" once again obviously a joke but still made me feel something esp since thats a common phrase he'll use in similar coversations . Even more examples  include: saying I look like a stud/boy, jokingly implying id do sexual favors for little things (ex.a burger),etc. Now I am fully aware we are different people with different perspectives and whenever i have brought up a specific type of joke and explained why it hurt me he put the effort in to stop and went the extra mile. But at the same time im still left drained everyday bc of how often I have to play off his other jokes and remind myself he's joking. I def feel comfortable communicating with him on this however idk know how to explain "" hey can u just be super careful with everything u say bc I'm extremely sensitive and it's making me extremely upset that u aren't always babying me"" I don't want to make seem like an asshole he isn't, and neither am I completely a drama queen, it's just a point I run of energy to keep reminding myself we just have 2 different types of humor and that it's all a joke. 

Tldr: boyfriend jokingly says things that hurt my feelings and despite playing most of it off, it's starting to take a toll on me. Ik he's joking and he loves me i just want a break from it everyday. How do i tell him that?",2024-11-10 03:29:16

This girl now had enough told me she wanted to break up with me cause i called him i told him sorry for the action will not repeat and told her as well ill get better so please give me chance during which she had ‘slept’ with that guy and me like a fool was trying to everything to get her back and change myself for good.
i told her i would let it go since i was trying and it was one sided she agreed to try again but still denied to remove that person from her circle (not stay in touch) and asks me to trust her she changed her insta password idk what to do. 
Second during her internship when things started to get better she had my insta id and she saw that i had texted a girl things after which she slept again with another guy there denied to tell me but thankfully one day we had long discussion where she told me that she had given up and after two years when i go usa we will try again to get back but to that i had told her i cannot accept her when she has done these kinda things and i kept waiting for her all this time after which she revealed that she slept with second person and wants to keep their pics they took together for he is male best friend🤦. 
Third very recently this person at a party asked her if she has alc at home he comes over they drink to extreme and she cant remember what happened that night 🤡 she is still in touch with this person and wants to keep the pictures. 

Before she was going to USA we had planned to tell our parents about each other that we want to settle down together and now our parents got rings as well she says now i can trust her since she will not repeat these but what do i do i had true feelings which are hurt i feel cheated on and now i cant get myself to bring love back😭🙂. 

I have no clue what to do when she was doing all these things i was working on myself and trying to fix things. I had true feelings for her even in that phase and i knew we would be stronger but after getting to know these things i am very broken my last relationship i got cheated on and i feel the same way for this one as well 😭😭😭😭 ffs man i never thought i would come to reddit and put this story to get right opinion and advice. 

Please help me decide on how to go ahead with this rship cause i feel broken? 

TL;DR : LDR got messed up due to my insecurity and she slept with multiple guys after breaking up which i didnt agree with and our parents want us to get married since before she was leaving we had told our parents. she wants me to trust her back but she cant stop being in touch with those guys since they are her male best friends.

Is this timing weird or am I overthinking it?

He seems engaged in person and will usually call me for a bit if I don't have work during the day. I have struggled with being cheated on in the past as well as having generalized anxiety disorder that I am medicated for. I just don't know what the ""standard"" would be or if I'm crazy for even worrying about this. I'm afraid to bring it up and seem controlling or push him away because things are still new and I'm trying to work on not being so triggered.

I will reiterate that there are no issues with our communication in person and he is extremely affectionate and treats me well (dates, cooking for me, remembering my preferences, asking if I got in safe, etc). He generally makes plans for the next time I will see him…I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable or not.

We got engaged in March of 2024. I’ve been considering leaving due to a lack of intimacy. The first two years we were romantic with each other and had plenty of good sex. Then it started to gradually farther apart. The last 4 years we might have done it 15 times and it was never good. Since the engagement we haven’t had sex once. 

I have kinks and she’s vanilla. She will do what I like but calling half assed is even a stretch. I’ve offered for us to go to a therapist or sex therapist and see if we can work things out but she seems content with how things are and doesn’t want to go. I’m living with her because I was still in school when my parents moved states and if I wanted to stay with her I’d have to live with her. I have a friend I can stay with if I decide to leave. She doesn’t want romance or sex or intimacy she just likes to act cute and then (to me) it feels like she’s ignoring my concerns. Worst of all to her it seems like she’s happy to marry me while we continue on like this. I know I can’t live like this and marry her. 

 It’s been 4 years like this. I know I messed up with the engagement but I thought it would help bring us closer together. What do I do?

How do I stop disliking them?

For context me and my bf have been together for 8 months and we’re in our final year of highschool. His mom is Filipino and his stepdad is old and white and they’re super strict towards him and they have been pretty unfair towards me. 

They’ve done things such as grounding him for the most stupid reasons such as being too slow to cook rice or just because they’re in a bad mood. 

Theres been multiple times where we’ve had dates planned but then his mom decides to not let him go just because she’s in a bad mood. 

The thing is they’re nice to my face but I know they’re not so nice behind my back because my bf has told me. 

They make unfair assumptions about my family such as assuming my mom lets me do whatever i want and he’s not allowed to come over to my house because his mom assumes that my mom won’t be home. 

I know this is mean but I think my bf is too good for his family. 

Just recently there was an incident where my resentment had built up so bad and I was having a bad day so I accidentally spoke a little bit rude to his 8 year old sister which I feel horrible for. My bf told me that they lectured him about it and were like “How could she speak to my daughter like that” “She’s a bad person” When my bf told me all this it was Halloween and I locked myself in a washroom. 

I really wanted to apologize and explain myself to them but my bf said that would make it worse since I’m not supposed to know that. It doesn’t make sense to me that I can’t know cause don’t they want me to be the way they want. After I had a good cry about that it’s like all my feelings of hatred slipped away and all I felt was guilt. 

I thought I had finally gotten rid of my negative feelings. Until Wednesday which was our 8 month anniversary. 

We were supposed to go see Smile 2 in theatres and then once again his parents randomly decided to not let him do that or anything after school. My feelings of resentment towards them came back. 

As I’m writing this him and his family are staying in the fairmont hotel for one night and it makes me angry which I know is wrong. It’s because I don’t think they deserve to go on a vacation with him even though it’s one night and it’s not a big deal. I feel like a horrible person. How do I change my feelings?

relationships,1gnx8ad,TL;DR - I’ve (26f) discovered my boyfriend (31m) has lied about having an Instagram account and uses it to look at other women. Any advice on how to tackle this? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnx8ad/tldr_ive_26f_discovered_my_boyfriend_31m_has_lied/,2,"TL;DR - This is a long one - I found out my boyfriend lied about having Instagram, and has been looking at other girls Instagram accounts and clicking the links to their adult website (we all know which one).

I recently discovered (by it coming up as a suggested friend) that my boyfriend has a secret Instagram account. I also discovered that he has a few TikTok videos in his likes of girls posting 'thirst trap' videos.

I confronted him about both of these things, and he was very defensive at first, and wouldn't let me go on his phone. He eventually let me, and I discovered that he had been clicking on links on women's Tiktok accounts, which took him to their Instagram account. Most of these Insta accounts had links to the adult website, which he had also clicked on.

He was very embarrassed when I confronted him about this, but said that he doesn't go on Instagram (I do have proof of this, as his whole account is blank and he wouldn't have had time to delete anything), and only ever goes on Instagram when he clicks the links on the TikTok bios. He also told me that he does NOT have a subscription to the adult website, and showed me that if he clicks onto it, there is no login info, and his email address is not registered, and he uses the Instagram accounts as a way of 'free p*rn', and nothing more. Most of the girls he has clicked on do have an adult website account, but some are just girls normal Instagram accounts (even if they do post pictures of their bums). He said he doesn't know why he's clicked on their adult website account link, he said that 'he just did'.

However, I do know one girl who was on his search history (no adult website account) he actually knows, and goes to the same gym as we do (he doesn't know that I saw her name on his search history).

I don't know how to feel about this. I don't necessarily think I have a problem with men watching p*rn, so long as our sex life isn't affected. But this feels different, as these are Instagram accounts, not normal adult website accounts.

His response was that he was incredibly sorry that he hid that he had an Instagram, and he was sorry about how I found out, but he wasn't sure if he should be sorry about the 'prn'. I told him that the fact that it wasn't prnhub or an actual prn website, that it feels more personal and upsetting. He said that it is literally just for prn, and he doesn't go on it that often. He said he had a slight p*rn addiction when he was with his ex (they didn't sleep together often at all, and weren't compatible).

He said that he adores me and loves me and thinks I'm beautiful, and he said that he does use my pictures as a way to get off when he needs to. He says that sometimes he will come across as account and he will click on it and it'll go from there, but again, it's just p*rn. He told me that he would never do anything to jeopardise our relationship, as he is very happy and he's never felt more secure and happy in a relationship. I do believe him, he is incredibly affectionate and says that he loves to show me off when we go out anywhere.

I believe that he finds me attractive, as he will always make me feel good if I'm in my underwear, etc. He has also said he would never do anything to hurt me, and that he would never cheat on me as he has been cheated on before and knows how much it hurts a person, and he cares about me too much to put me through that.

He has since unliked the videos he had liked on tiktok, and is not secretive with his phone or anything, asking me who has text him if is phone goes off and it's not near to him.

I've never had a reason not to trust him, and I don't think I'm worried about him cheating. This situation has just made me feel so uncomfortable and disrespected to an extent, and I just want to know if I'm overreacting about the whole thing, or if I'm within my right to be hurt by this. I don't want to leave him over this, we are buying a campervan together and he talks about us getting a house when we are back from travelling. This just isn't sitting well with me.

The thing that is stressing me the most is the woman on his Instagram that I know goes to our gym. I have no proof that he's used this woman's images as a way to get off, or if he was just genuinely curious as this is someone he potentially knows.

I am unsure of my next move. I don't want this to keep weighing on me and I don't want to be bitter. Any advice on how best to proceed would be appreciated. I want to stay together, but I want to be respected, and I want to feel like I am enough. What should my next steps be?",2024-11-10 09:47:52
relationships,1gmuhjl,My (26M) girlfriend (26F) gave me an ultimatum regarding a group trip,355,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gmuhjl/my_26m_girlfriend_26f_gave_me_an_ultimatum/,117,"I (26M) really need an outside perspective on a situation with my girlfriend (26F).

For starters, my girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Throughout our relationship, things have been mostly good. Our schedules conflict a bit, and we’ve had our issues, but we make it work.

A big issue between us right now is over a good friend (28F) of mine. For clarity, I’ll refer to this friend as Violet.

For some context, me and Violet are part of a small friend group. There’s two other people in the group. We met while attending a film festival around two years ago now. We were all waiting in line to enter the theater. The line was long, and we all kind of naturally struck conversation and hit it off. We kept in contact afterwards.

Everyone in the group is mostly long distance. So we can’t hang out in person altogether too much, but we talk daily and have weekly group gaming sessions and anime/movie watchalongs. Violet lives the closest near me pretty much in the next town over, so we see each other in person the most outside of the group’s virtual meet-ups.

I do want to mention that I invited my girlfriend to each virtual and in-person meetups, and she turned me down every time. I try including her, but she doesn’t want anything to do with it in large part because she doesn’t particularly care for our interests. Stuff like anime, manga, or gaming is childish to her. The movies we watch are mostly older era films and films that were restored, but she’s not into those either.

This disconnect between us was an issue before I even made this group of friends. It’s not like she’ll engage in these things to spend time together. Like I grew up on game nights. I’m not even talking about video games necessarily. I’m talking board games, card games, etc…, but she doesn’t care for that.

She either shuts it down and goes off to do her own thing, or if she does actually watch something with me or play a game, then she makes it known that it’s a chore for her, and she belittles whatever it is increasingly throughout. She calls it joking, but it feels more like belittling. It gets to a point where I don’t even enjoy whatever we’re watching or playing.

I’m not particularly a huge fan of reality TV, but I still watch with her and try genuinely engaging because, for me, it’s not about the show so much as it’s about spending some quality time together.

So my friendship with the group has been a nice change of pace and has brought some balance, but it’s become an ongoing issue in my relationship. Recently, the group has been putting together a trip to this upcoming anime con. The event lasts for a weekend, so the plan was to stay together at an AirBNB and split the cost.

My girlfriend is outright against the trip because of Violet. She doesn’t like my friendship with her and doesn't really seem to like Violet at all. She has a general annoyance whenever Violet’s involved and gets upset whenever I talk or hang out with her. We could be having a disagreement about something entirely unrelated, and somehow it’ll circle around to Violet. She also calls Violet a “pick-me girl.”

When the trip was first being put together, I invited my girlfriend. She had no interest in coming and later expressed an issue with me going. She doesn’t like that I’d be staying in the same house as Violet during the trip. I offered a compromise of me just booking a hotel and meeting up with everyone, but that wasn’t an acceptable option for her either.

Nothing I propose she’s willing to hear me out on. It’s all on deaf ears because she knows Violet’s going. The trip has become a major point of contention between us. She now says that it’s proof that I have feelings for Violet because I keep defending her during arguments and because I won’t let the trip go.

I haven’t let the trip go because I would really like to attend the con, and it’s rare that everyone in the group’s schedules link up like this. My girlfriend views it as me taking a getaway with Violet.

She’s firm on her position on the trip and has given me an ultimatum. She said I could do whatever I wanted but know that if I went on the trip, then I'd be choosing Violet over her and that she'd act accordingly.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not saying her feelings are invalid. Her feelings are her feelings, but I feel that she’s being unreasonable and that her insecurity about my friendship with Violet is baseless.

I feel pulled in two different directions and now this ultimatum. All I do is compromise in our relationship, and it just feels one-sided. I don’t understand why this one thing would be a dealbreaker. How do I go about addressing this with her now?

TL;DR My girlfriend has given me an ultimatum regarding a friend group trip and I don’t know what to do. How do I go about addressing this with her now?",2024-11-08 22:06:33
relationships,1gntk13,What to do about sex drive incompatibility ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gntk13/what_to_do_about_sex_drive_incompatibility/,2,"Hello, I’m F23 and my partner M25 have been together for around 9 years. Everything is great! We have good communication and we are very much in love. I’m so fortunate to be able to say that I have fun with my partner every day. We’re always goofing around and we have a closeness that I think is really special. Aside from typical relationship ups and downs, I think we are pretty happy and healthy! All of that said, there is one issue that keeps coming back to the surface. We have pretty different sex drives. 

My partner has a much higher sex drive than me. I am satisfied with very little/occasional sexual contact and he’s more on a weekly/multiple times a week basis. I know this isn’t an uncommon problem but Im not sure how to handle this incompatibility. I often find myself rejecting my partner as gently as I can, the  reassuring him of my attraction to him, and sometimes even changing the subject when we approach intimacy territory. I know this is in a lot of ways cruel and unfair to him. 

I don’t want my partner to feel rejected any more, and I want to do what I can to be there physically for him. When he tells me how our sex life is effecting him, I usually hyper focus on sex for a few days/weeks and then start to forget to keep it up after we seem to be doing well again. I don’t stop intentionally, I usually just start feeling like we are happy and doing well and we usually are until he points out that we aren’t being intimate again. I don’t mean to forget, it just isn’t at the fore front of my mind and I often don’t even realize that days and weeks have gone by. 

I am on a medication that can hurt my sex drive but admittedly it was just as bad before this medication. I know that I have pretty intense body image problems as well as religious trauma that are effecting my interests in sex and I am trying to work through them. The medication helps me feel more present in my body and in my relationship so I wouldn’t want to stop taking it. Also I have never really had much of a sex drive, to the point that I never really had celebrity crushes growing up, or crushes past “he’s so cool”. 

I love my partner and I truly am attracted to him and enjoy our sex. I just can’t get into the mood much. I know I’m not alone but I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions? I have been considering setting timers to watch porn weekly hoping that will help me get to that mindset lol but I don’t know if that’s really a healthy thing to do. I have heard a lot of suggestions to open our relationship so that he can fulfill this portion of his desires and admittedly I am too insecure for that. I have brought this up to him to see what he thinks and he says that he wouldn’t want to do that any way. Just to be clear, I have asked him if this is a deal breaker to have a low sex relationship if I am not able to improve my sex drive and he says no, but I can’t help but feel like I am neglecting him. Anyone have any tips or suggestions? 

TLDR: I 23F have a much lower sex drive than partner 25M. How can I increase this or be there for him more often?

relationships,1gnkbpj,How do you know someone loves you back as much as you love them?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnkbpj/how_do_you_know_someone_loves_you_back_as_much_as/,1,"I (18F) and my girlfriend (18F) have been dating a month, I reaally like her alot and it feels so different to the past relationships ive had with men, but ive sort of felt anxious that she doesnt like me as much back, i mean ive known her for over a year but in year 1 of college we were both sort of trying to pretend we were into men as we were struggling a bit with accepting being gay ( i had a very shitty boyfriend and she had a twink she pretended to be in love with LOL)

When we started year 2 of college we started talking more and i realised how much we had in common, and realised she was into women- she told me she was talking to this girl and i felt a taaad jealous, she stopped talking to that girl so i sort of started trying to flirt my way towards her a bit more and it evidently worked, however, she told me the girl she was talking to she sort of just went along with it as the girl mistook her compliment for flirting, im scared she’s done the same with me except its just gone further? I dont knoooeew.. maybe i am just scared because she’s the first person ive truly and genuinely felt feelings for but that whole thing makes me scared.

I dont want to stress her with it because i dont want to seem emotionally attatched so soon into the relationship, and i dont let it actually effect our relationship- but i dont know how to communicate it or see the signs (i know it is quite a normal thing to feel just id love some advice)

TL;DR— im nervous my gf doesnt like me back as much as I like her because the last girl she was speaking to she was only going along with it as the she complimented the girl and the girl mistook it as flirting and started flirting (so she reciprocated) im scared its the same with me but has just gone further",2024-11-09 21:22:49
relationships,1gnnbsr,Do I need to break up with him?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnnbsr/do_i_need_to_break_up_with_him/,5,"Do I need to break up with him?

I (18)F have a boyfriend (19)M and have been with him for about 2 and a half years. I feel like the relationship is broken, his family have treated me like shit for years. His sister would follow me round the house calling me fat, starting arguments with me for no reason and getting me kicked out. His dad is nasty, not only does he abuse all the kids but he has been nothing but awful to me aswell. When we first got together, there was a lot of sexual chemistry. Fucking like rabbits as one would say, now it’s just that I simply don’t want to have sex with him. Whenever we argue, he ignores me, gives me the cold shoulder. He acts as though i don’t exist, and has been breaking up with me and getting back together with me for 2 and a half years. 
Whenever we are together, we have nothing to speak about. I don’t feel as though he is right for me, but I don’t know how to go with breaking up with him as I’m not sure if that’s even what I want to do. When we get on, we get on, but whenever we don’t it’s like we could light each others houses on fire.
 He lies about things, all the time. Which makes it hard for me to truly understand what happened in situations, as i know he isn’t going to tell me the truth regardless. 
I don’t know what to do, I need genuine advice.

relationships,1gnr8jz,"Young couple living together in new country. Issues with depression, finding work and financial differences. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gnr8jz/young_couple_living_together_in_new_country/,6,"My girlfriend (F 19) and I (M 24) have officially been in a relationship since 4 months. We met in her hometown while I was on en exchange in Latin America. I study at a university in Europe back in my home country. I decided to extend my stay with an internship so be both moved to a different country in Latin America, where I found a interesting offer. This means we are living together in a new city.

Currently, I have to provide for the both of us. The apartment is covered as part of the internship deal and I pay for our food, trips etc. For me providing for her felt like a big step considering we are in a young relationship. However, it is currently our only option for being together. She has no saving her parents don’t support her financially and she hasn’t found a job due to visa problems. My internship will finish in 3 months. Financially I can support the both of us during the time, but I would like to hear your opinion to what degree I should help her financially. For example, I thought about giving her a weekly allowance until she finds a job, buying her some new shoes and paying for a larger vacation during Christmas.
 
Currently the most challenging for her is that she had to spend so much time alone. It’s her first time in a really big city and she has not left our neighbourhood alone more than two times. While I go to work she stays at home with a lot of time being bored. I told her she could invest the time to study something related to her interests or leave her curriculum in more places to find a job. But she has problems with motivating herself and is falling into a depression. I myself have had depression so I can understand her to some degree. I can give her emotional support. But I don’t know what else to do and I am worried that things worsen, if she continues isolated like this. I thought it might be best for here to go back to live with her family some weeks, but she doesn’t want that. Do you have any suggestions what we can do to improve her situation and make her feel better? Are there other ways I can give her support with?

Furthermore, the both of us don’t have any friends here, so when I get off work it’s a given that we do things together all the time. I have been living solo my whole life so this is a huge contrast. Is it a lot to ask that I want to spend some time alone as well sometimes? In terms of humor, interests and activities we have a lot in common. But sometimes I feel overwhelmed with our current situation. For such a young relationship things got pretty serious quickly. Is this normal when two people from countries so far apart meet? 

TL;DR: we are a young couple living in an entirely new country. I have the provider role and she has no occupation. She struggles with depression and I feel a bit overwhelmed with the responsibility. 
I am looking for opinions on our situation, did we take to large steps? What can we do to improve her situation? ",2024-11-10 03:11:20
