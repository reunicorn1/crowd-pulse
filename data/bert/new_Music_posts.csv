Several years ago I saw Matisyahu at a small club. Of the 10 songs I liked, he played about one. He was also very standoffish on stage and so was the crowd. I would never see him again. 
The other example is Rob Zombie. I was a big fan of his early albums especially with White Zombie. I saw him last year on the Freaks on  Parade tour. He sounded so bad and the band was so lifeless and lame on stage that we left early. Very disappointing especially compared to the opening bands Alice Cooper and Ministry. It also made me realize that his voice is so processed and sounds the same in every song. Ruined my appreciation. ",2024-11-13 01:14:18

From the list my personal favourites were Donuts by J Dilla and The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails. I think what did it for J Dilla’s album was that it was absolutely not what i expected and i knew next to nothing about him! I was expecting a standard 00s hip hop album based on the cover and name and what I got instead just blew me away. The Downward Spiral is such a journey and I was simply lost for words.

I also fondly remember my first listen to Dark Side of the Moon several years ago when I was 18 and just discovering some of the best music history has to offer. Just wondering if anyone else had a first listen experience that just blew them away?

Edit: Another great first listen was Aquemini by Outkast. I’d already listened to Stankonia and wasn’t blown away by it, in fact i wasn’t even a huge fan of it really so when i reached Aquemini on my list I really wasn’t expecting much and then wow. Absolutely amazing",2024-11-12 20:00:38

And again I'm annoyed by the way things turned out. Again its general fields are only about popularity (sales, money). And the genre categories are very unevenly spread. Rap alone has as many categories as all rock genres for example. 
And the Grammy's, again, don't reflect the world of music. Although they claim to be the biggest night in music in the world and have some ""excuse"" awards for African and World music. 
How can the Grammy's become fairer and better reflect what's going on in music?
I'd like to see less categories (two per genre only, one album, one song) or the show being split up. I would like specialised voters, only voting for their fields of expertise (or at least voters that really listened to the work they vote for). And make up the general fields of work that has won the genre categories. And, most wanted: More work and artists from Asia, Australia, mainland Europe, Africa and Latin America in regular categories.

What is a song that makes you cry (or verging of crying) every time you hear it. Something that gives you a strong physical/emotional reaction almost immediately. Like within the first line/note/word etc. 

For me, it’s “leaves from the vine” the song, the words, the music behind it, the story for the character and the knowledge of the voice actor during the scene makes me have this strong, painful feeling in my chest and instantly brings tears upon the VERY first note. 

It seems to do the same for my kids as well. We all watched Avatar: The Last Airbender together. And it immediately became my daughter’s (8yo) favorite show. She’s watched nothing else for months. Knows every line. And I just recently learned that she has skipped this episode every. Single. Time. Since the first time she watched it with me. 

I learned this after I tried to play an instrumental version and she freaked and told me not to play it and was immediately crying! 

So I’m curious, what song invokes these feelings for you and why?",2024-11-12 07:33:48

Hardy is rumored to have guested on a bunch of Czarface songs, and the latest 'Knull & Void' was featured in the credits for Hardy's newest movie Venom: The Last Dance. Method Man is also on it. Tom's got the second verse.

Let me know what you think, thank you! Trying to have this complete by Christmas as a surprise to my family. ",2024-11-12 21:54:49

Music,1gq6amd,Who is the next David Bowie?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gq6amd/who_is_the_next_david_bowie/,8,"Are there any modern artists who could be considered the next David Bowie? Of course, no one could truly replace Bowie—he was a one-of-a-kind icon who reshaped music and pop culture with his constant reinvention. Bowie’s ability to change genres, personas, and aesthetics made him a true chameleon. It got me thinking if anyone today shares a similar approach. So far, the only artist who comes to mind is Tyler, the Creator. He's at the peak of his career and is incredibly influential, not just for his genre-defying music but for his dynamic personas that evolve with each album. Like Bowie, Tyler releases highly conceptual records, each with its own unique character. Plus, as a queer artist, he brings a new, complex layer to his music and identity, reminiscent of Bowie’s boundary-breaking spirit. Thoughts?",2024-11-13 06:00:28

Thinking back to the 80's (and late 70's) in Canada, we had a lot of fun, great music.   Of course, we had groups and artists that had a global audience, but there was just so much less widely known, fun music that just brings a sense of nostalgia for that time.  I did a deep dive on YouTube last night and found artists that I hadn't thought about in years - but would hear their music on the radio, in the dorms, or even at pit/bush parties.   Here are some of them - I'm wondering if people remember some great, fun 80's Canadian music that makes them feel like they are ""16 again"".

But, why is that? When I was a senior in high school 15 years ago, I bought their two most popular albums, *Highway to Hell* and *Back In Black*, and tired of them rather quickly.

It seems as though all they do is recycle the same sound on every album (metallic blues-rock). No matter what, I simply cannot get into them for an extended period of time. Recently, I added several rock artists to my library: Poison, Bon Jovi, Europe, Twisted Sister, Sublime, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Bullet for My Valentine, Styx, Helloween, My Chemical Romance, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Buffalo Springfield, Jackson Browne, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, The Velvet Underground, The Byrds, Exodus, Testament, Between the Buried and Me, The String Cheese Incident, Phish, Quiet Riot, and Kate Bush--all of whom, in my opinion, are far better than AC/DC.

Can someone help me understand the appeal that AC/DC has had? Because, I just, for the life of me, cannot figure it out.

Music,1gpei3p,Music took my life,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gpei3p/music_took_my_life/,5,"I realize that compared to other posts in this sub, this might not seem very relevant. But what I’m about to share has been weighing on me for far too long, and it troubles me deeply.

I’m 25 now, and for the past 10 years, I’ve dedicated nearly every waking moment of my life to expressing myself through art. I didn’t do this for the validation, the bohemian image, or because I come from privilege—I’m anything but that. I grew up in a broken home, and art was never something I could afford, either in time or money.

I used it as an outlet for my frustration and pain because it was the only way I could release those emotions. Whenever life didn’t work out, I would draw until my hand physically gave out, or I’d write obsessively, spending hours perfecting a single sentence until it flowed just the way it sounded in my head. Thousands of hours of this, and I didn’t feel the need to share it with anyone—I thought it was just something everyone did.


Growing up, my parents had hope I’d get into an art academy. They seemed confident I’d somehow figure it out. After a while, when my hand grew tired and my drive to write faded, there was one thing I couldn’t quite satisfy.


Music.


I never thought I’d be capable of making music, despite growing up surrounded by it. But just like with art, I turned to it as a coping mechanism. I poured my isolation and repressed feelings into it, sacrificing sleep and sanity to figure it out.

And I did.

I realized that the more unfulfilled I felt, the better the result. There was a connection. I had to fill this emptiness inside.

I spent hours studying different genres—learning their histories, how they evolved, how they influenced each other. I read books and scoured online forums from the '90s, hunting for answers to questions I hadn’t even formulated yet. I built a small collection of obscure records from around the world—Blues, Jazz, Soul, Rock, Psychedelic, Funk, Punk, New-Wave, Hip-Hop, Electronic—you name it. I started hearing the essence of what felt ""real"" to me in the music.


It was the pain that made it real.


Soon, I started fantasizing about making my own record. I wondered how it would sound, and it was almost absurd how clearly I could hear it in my head—songs that didn’t exist yet.



I began to understand frequencies, and how shaping them shapes sound. I started recording, deconstructing my recordings, rearranging them, and discovering the world of sampling. I developed an ear for texture and ambiance, for tension and release, and used these concepts to tell stories—sometimes without ever resolving them. I explored complex ideas like polyrhythms, polymetric modulations, syncopation, and scales from cultures far removed from my own.


I played with music, and it played with me.


I became obsessed. I would zone out when out with friends, or simply stay home. I lost jobs, grew resentful, and nearly hated myself.


But I care so much about my creations.
They are the only thing I have going for me.

Never mind relationships, trips, restaurants or the like. 


It’s funny—when you hear about musicians who are depressed or barely survive, you wonder, ""Why aren’t they just happy?""


But then, 20 years later, you find yourself alone in a cold, empty apartment with nothing but wires, blinking lights from cheap drum machines, missed calls from people who lent you money to buy synths and cables, and an ashtray full of shit clogging up the already dense and sleepless air.


I wonder what will happen to me.


But based on all of this, I doubled down. I started DJing, working in a club to make money, and became even more consumed by music. I met people who made and played music, and for the first time, I didn’t feel so alone.


Nothing really changed. Except the sound. It grew darker, more mature.


I can’t ""sell"" myself the way everyone suggests.

Not because I’m too ""authentic"" or anything like that. I can’t because what I do is priceless to me. It’s the only thing I have, and I don’t know how to commodify it. I’d let someone else handle that, but I don’t trust anybody around me.

I stopped seeing myself as an artist a long time ago. I understand now that creating is just my way of coping with something deeper—maybe something undiagnosed.
And the world today demands we all become entrepreneurs. Everything is broken down into numbers and metrics.


But it wasn’t always like this.


Some of us just need peace. Some of us just need the bare minimum to live comfortably so we can keep doing what we love.


I don’t know what will happen, but I want to share my work with the world. I’ve been lucky to experience so much beauty, and if it’s not too arrogant, I’d like to give some of that beauty back.

Currently there thousands of hours on my computer. I do not know what will happen if I die and it just disappears. This scares me the most.


If you feel the pain occasionally, make sure to give me a listen. It might help you, or me.

Sorry if this sounds pretentious.

My first concert I ever went to by myself though was The Lumineers in 2021. My favorite band period is Pink Floyd. I came to them at an emotional point (close family member passed unexpectedly in 2021), and their music just clicked with me. It was like finding “the one” but with music. But I knew I’d probably never see them together live. So I had to make do with their studio stuff or cover bands like Brit Floyd (who are tremendous btw). That was until I saw the legend himself, David Gilmour, was on tour this year and made his last stop on at the legendary Madison Square Garden. Seeing him the last night, only a few hundred feet from my seat…it meant the world to me. Words can’t describe. His music saved my life. 

But enough about me. I’m curious to hear from all of you what concerts you’ve been to that have a special meaning for you. ",2024-11-12 14:55:10

Music,1gpkb3p,Rap songs with interesting beats from 2024?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gpkb3p/rap_songs_with_interesting_beats_from_2024/,7,"Hi everyone,

for a while now, trap beats and 808s have been kind of the ""way to go"" for beatmakers in Hip Hop. While I really like what they did over the years, I feel like I've heard that enough, and I also feel like trap + 808 is not the ""fresh new thing"" any more.

While there are still artists putting out new music with the classic 808 + trap inspired sounds (like Doja Cat or Ice Spice), I just listened to the new Tylor the Creator album, and I really like how he's using a more ""analogue"" sound, with inspirations from 70s Motown and Rock (even with samples from classic Rock songs).

I think this is a very nice way of pushing the sound of Hip Hop forward. However, I wondered how other artists approach 808 + trap not being the ""fresh new thing"" any more.

Do you have any recommendations for tracks that try out alternative approaches to beat styles, preferably from this year? I'd also be intersted in tracks that do use 808s or trap elements, but use them in interesting new ways I haven't heard before.

Thanks a lot in advance.",2024-11-12 13:07:49

Known for his unique style, raw storytelling, and bold perspective, Priicy is making waves with his unfiltered take on life, struggle, and authenticity in today’s hip-hop landscape. His release marks a defining moment, bringing overdue representation and a new dimension to hip-hop culture.

With ""Poetic Frustration,"" Priicy sets the stage for what he hopes will be a lasting impact on the music industry, spotlighting his journey as a proud gay artist. He aims to shatter stereotypes, defy expectations, and, above all, showcase that versatility in hip-hop is not only possible but essential.

It’s a new lane in hip-hop, a testament to resilience and self-expression.

Anyway one thing I've noticed from Slim Shady LP onwards is how angry Em is at his critiques who are blaming him for violance and bad influence, which honestly is kinda deserved. Early Eminem is so edgy

I've read some articles on the topic  and most of the solutions implemented so far are a joke and seem to make it even harder for the fans. 
Is there anything that can make a difference to this problem? 
What if they made name change on tickets impossible and only offered refunds when someone can't make it? Could sell such tickets later at last minute or something. Would that stop the scalping industries?

Music,1gp8m7g,The First Album Released on Compact Cassette,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gp8m7g/the_first_album_released_on_compact_cassette/,2,"I was wondering what the first album to be released on the new compact cassette format was, so I did some searching.

The compact cassette format was 'invented' by the Dutch company Philips in 1962. Not an original invention but more an innovation based on older tape technologies.

It came in two forms: the 'musicassette' for pre-recorded music, and the 'blank' for making personal recordings.

Philips debuted the compact cassette in August 1963 at the Berlin Radio Show.

'Blank' cassette production began in Germany in 1964.  
'Musicassettes' were launched in Europe in late 1965.

Mercury Records (USA) were bought by Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp. (Conelco) in 1962, which was an affiliate of Philips.

Mercury Records (Germany) released the first 'musicassettes' in 1965 starting with a Fat Domino compilation with the catalogue number of 75001 CDE called 'Fats Domino !'.

'Musicassettes' were introduced to the US market by Mercury Records (USA) in July 1966 with an initial 49 titles.

So it could be either vibe, I really don't care as long as it sounds cool.

Lately I've grown to like the mix a rock and rap, just songs that bring out the best of both. Something loud to block out the insults when I'm trying to buy dinner.
Anything that gives a fuck the government vibe will do fine as well.

I like Jeris Johnson, zillakami, flux pavilion, kind of immortal technique, but over all I really like when there is a distinct uniqueness about the sound.

I read the Vinyl sales are back to a peak that was established in the early 90s, which is pretty crazy to me. From my understanding, it feels like people who were not traditional music-aficionados - those who chase after limited pressings or really value the difference in sound quality for certain kinds of music - are getting into it for 'the lifestyle' or because it's nostalgic in some way, and these are somewhat younger people.

The concept is somewhat the same, but more ergonomic-we use neural networks to convert any audio into this format :) This allows you to learn any piano piece. I suppose purists will debate the relevance of this type of learning, but a growing number of musicians today start learning on YouTube! So there is a real need...

You can add it as a web app on your portable device, and use it on android/ios tablet

Here is an exemple of a jazz piece automatically converted from YouTube : [https://studio.ivory-app.com/player?id=1519](https://studio.ivory-app.com/player?id=1519). We are using a combination of convolutional and transformer network to get to this results, we are also working on sheet generation.

Feel free to comment, and if you have any ideas for the evolution of the tool, features to add, I'd be curious to hear them!

Music,1gpg998,I don’t connect with music as others do?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gpg998/i_dont_connect_with_music_as_others_do/,4,"Hi all, I started listening to some music from the beginning of high school. I liked music that “sounded” good or things I tended to like, but didn’t pay attention to the lyrics all that much. I never obsessed with celebrities or their lives though.

I was in a relationship recently and my ex was a person who loved music and she related songs to everything in her life, all her difficulties. Music was there for her when she didn’t have support from people. She also was able to relate herself to the artists lives and similar things going on.

I feel weird and in-human that I don’t connect to music like my ex did or the way others do. I see people around me who enjoy music and they also feel the lyrics and all that. I understand that everyone is different but I’m wondering if there are people similar to me as well. 

—-

Now I don’t want to seem like I’m sexist, but women tend to like what they hear, so I guess that could be one reason why I don’t tend to be into music as deeply as others.

Another thing could be that I didn’t go through events or difficulties to be able to relate to music lyrics and really feel them.

—-

Some additional context about me is that I tend to like movies and shows since middle school, like action, fantasy, anime, teen drama, etc. I like music from movies and shows at times as well.",2024-11-12 08:34:02

I was wrong. I'm a rapper and singer who has immense struggles with my voice. However, I'm a great songwriter, lyricist and composer. People tell me I should explore producing, or even veer more into the business side of music. But i can't. For some reason there's an unshakeable voice inside me that tells me I need to perform, sing, rap my own songs. I've invested in years of vocal lessons, but my voice is just not pleasing. I've decided to ask Reddit because I'm not sure where else to go. It almost feels like when I'm recording songs, I'm not using my full voice, or I'm restricting myself subconsciously. I feel as though when I'm singing or rapping, it should feel intuitive, it should feel expressive, it should feel natural. But it doesn't feel like that for me. It feels forced. I've studied the greats for years, fallen asleep to music that I consider exceptional, even driven out of my house at night just so i can practice in my car. Yet nothing seems to help. One thing remains though, I still love it. I love writing, i love singing, and i love that i'm still trying. I simply love the entire music making process. REDDIT, PLEASE HELP IF YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE.

Don't ask me  
What you know is true

I love your precious heartI

You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apartWe could live  
For a thousand years

I'd make wine from your tears  
I told you  
That we could fly  
'Cause we all have wings  
But some of us don't know whyI was standing

And they could never ever tear us apartI (don't ask me)

Two worlds collided (we're shining through)

Like now most of rap songs are indistinguishable from some others because the beats and flows sound all the same. And don’t get me started on most of the auto tune rappers I means some of them can use it but most of them suck. Most of the songs are repeating what the other songs are about too all they talk about is “oh I have a lot of money”, “oh I get girls” and “oh I shoot people”. I’ve tried to listen to it and I could never get into it because they are all recycling the same beats flows and all the same topics of the song. 
So basically newer rap is usually 1. The same beats and flows 2. Bad auto tune 3. The same recycled topics of the songs.

I used to listen to it on my iPod shuffle. All I know is that it was upbeat-ish, sung by a woman, and sort of sounds like If You Seek Amy by Britney Spears (maybe?).

This is a real shot in the dark because I remember so little about it. I would’ve listened to it in between 2010-2014 but it was a song that likely came out within the 2000s. 

It most likely wasn’t a well known song and if there’s a chance it was sung by a big artist, it would’ve been a b side. It’s probably an impossible find with such little information but I figured I’d see if anyone could help.",2024-11-11 22:45:09

I'd love if y'all checked out the music that has been released thus far, Ethan Sak's ""BLUE"" concept album from 2022 (music only version). The original concept album accrued 1 million views over the last two years, telling a story on the beauty of grief, and the elegance of sadness (both are songs titles on the album. The music only version attempts to capture the ideas of each song one by one, where the concept album itself was a standalone story. Stream BLUE (Music Only) on all platforms today!

**Post:**

Alright, hear me out: imagine an album called *CYNICAL*. It's one of those rare gems that doesn't just give you music—it gives you a *lens* through which to see the world. It’s a brutal, in-your-face exploration of a truth we all know but rarely talk about: women, just like anyone, can be both victims *and* villains. And sometimes, the line between the two is razor-thin.

In *CYNICAL*, we’re taken on a journey that starts with heartbreak and betrayal but dives so much deeper. It’s about how the archetype of “the victim” isn’t always what it seems—and how, sometimes, it can be weaponized. The album questions: how much of what we see as “oppression” is genuinely that, and how much is a convenient mask for manipulation?

The lead single, **“Heartless Bitches”**, hits hard. It’s almost like the track looks you in the eye and dares you to judge these women. Some tracks like *""No Comment""* are hauntingly raw—like overhearing confessions whispered into the night. Others, like **“Daughter of the Devil,”** bring an almost dark, seductive energy, showcasing women embracing the ruthless sides of their personas, wielding pain like a weapon, turning victimhood on its head.

The whole album is like walking a tightrope between empathy and distrust. One minute, you’re completely siding with them; the next, you’re questioning everything they say. The final track, *""Smoke and Mirrors,""* hits like a plot twist, asking: *Is it the world that made them this way, or is it just easier to let everyone think so?*

*Of course, all this is fictional, but honestly?* If this album existed, it’d probably be the most talked-about release of the year.",2024-11-11 17:59:05

My partner (31F) likes Taylor Swift but otherwise doesn't know what she likes, she's mentioned that she hasn't had a previous partner that's taken in active interest in exploring what music she likes. Starting at Taylor Swift, what would be some appropriate/realistic artists/songs to test out with her next to get deeper into what she likes? Finding out what it is she does like exactly.

For full transparency, I'm into some fairly unusual genres like west african jazz, indian metal, didgeridoos, etc. I know I can't move her all the way to that, but I would like to expand the palate a bit so road trips are more enjoyable for both of us etc. I'd like to meet in the middle at something when we are together because I am eternally listening to music.

Thanks!",2024-11-11 18:35:13

* [Little Green Bag (George Baker Selection)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sobvrbX-_tM) - that intro! And then a complete change of mood into a very 60s sounding song.
* [50 Ways to Leave Your Lover (Paul Simon)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ABXtWqmArUU) - Steve Gadd's linear drumming creates a great atmosphere in the verse, only for the chorus to destroy it.
* [Merry Christmas Everyone (Shakin' Stevens)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N-PyWfVkjZc) - Beautifully simple and delightfully cheesy first verse, which then abruptly swerves into complete cheese in the second verse.

Jeff Buckley > Tim Buckley


-----------

More controversial... 

Sean Lennon > John Lennon. (Skill wise. Not fame or influence wise, but in ability and variety Sean surpasses his dad).

Edit: I'm not saying Sean is *better* than John. 

I'm simply saying his musical skill level has now surpassed his dad. Meaning his ability to play instruments. His musicianship. (He also makes much more varied and eclectic music than his dad. Though John of course has written better songs overall)

Check out Sean's guitar work in [The Claypool Lennon Delirium](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yUsje7CszKGu4g1f4ih3b?si=6uBWt4RZQayvRcYgJW0GfQ) super cool prog almost-supergroup project. 

And his latest instrumental ambient solo album [Asterisms](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ShpWpMEpCnFG7z7vcF4nN?si=FdII2K22QeGxkIHhmnj1ZA)



Edit 2: Let's say John is a more talented songwriter and lyricist (obvs), while Sean has become a more talented musician overall.

I like Sabrina, don't get me wrong, I just find it so unfair and strange that after releasing 6 albums in 10 years, she's still considered as a new artist. There are many other NEW singers who deserve the best new artist award more than her. Has this happened before?

Edit: THERE IS NO MAXIMUM also means artists who have released 20 albums (in a span of a decade or two most likely) can still be considered ""new"" as long as their breakthough hasn't been reached yet, since many of you are saying it's the artist's ""breakthrough"" that is being considered.",2024-11-09 10:16:21

And so a legends was born straight outta da womb

Little did they know he’d be more precious than cleo’s tomb

The struggles he must face has only just begun

The struggles keep arising like the setting of the sun

Mama has to work and needs ta leave him

The pain of that to him is like treason

Hearing these transformations makes me wonder how changing the key can affect the overall feel of a song, sometimes even [making it sound better in unexpected ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srd-NYIEJ2o).

I’m not actually making the key changes myself, but I’m looking for examples where others have done this brilliantly. I’d love to hear songs where the key shift genuinely enhances the experience, bringing out new dimensions or improving the feel of the original. Also, any thoughts on how these transformations impact a song’s emotional tone, or if there are particular genres or types of music that lend themselves to key inversions. Are there any examples or insights on how key changes shape our listening experience (other then minor is usually a sad mood and major an happy one)?

Music,1gojzzj,Music elitists in general are hilarious and wrong.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gojzzj/music_elitists_in_general_are_hilarious_and_wrong/,29,"I'd consider an ""elitist"" to be anyone who speaks negatively on things they don't listen to. And there are different degrees. 

From my point of view, I don't understand how anyone could call themselves a fan of music if they dismiss and insult styles outside of what they listen to. Metalheads are awful at this with their millions of subgenres and everyone claiming THEY have found ""true metal.""

But this goes for the metal haters too! Like, why shut yourself off from a genre that's so vast and diverse it would be literally impossible for you to not find something you loved if you looked hard enough? It's almost heinous the amount of people avoid metal due to their misunderstanding of the genre. That doesn't even get down to my main point, though.

Music was not created for you, necessarily. Maybe in contemporary pop, rap, country, etc. But that's another discussion, and this still applies there. I believe it is wholly unproductive to dismiss ANY music. That entails applying your own expectations about what music is or what it can be and putting limits on your own experience of the media in front of you. Therefore ""missing the point"" if you would. The listener is the only one that misses out.

Even if the song is lacking any quality whatsoever, usually you can laugh at it and so can the artists later on. Such as Rebecca Black. Ain't no one listening to that, but it still arguably brought people closer by giving us all something cheesy to laugh at. Therefore adding SOME value.

I've discovered so many new things about my taste through just shutting up and feeling the intention of the piece. I can confidently say that I listen to everything. And this doesn't mean there aren't going to be genres you like much better than others, but that nails on chalkboard feeling elitists get when they hear something different comes not from the music, but from themselves. And when you let the intention of the music form your expectations, you can find the purpose.
