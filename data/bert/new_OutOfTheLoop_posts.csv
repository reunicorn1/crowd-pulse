OutOfTheLoop,1gq3wqv,What's going on with Roblox?,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1gq3wqv/whats_going_on_with_roblox/,22,"This post was mostly in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gppsi3/how_can_i_undo_my_mistake_introducing_my_kids_to/), which I was recommended on Reddit. It implies that introducing children to the game is a grave mistake and does not elaborate on what exactly about Roblox makes it that way.

As far as I know:

* Roblox is an online multiplayer platform
* Roblox hosts a variety of different game types/genres
   * A lot of these can be seen as unoriginal or low-effort (Obbys, Tycoons, etc.)
* Roblox has some kind of system in place allowing a layman to develop an experience with it, through the Roblox Studio application, thus relies heavily on community contribution.
   * I don't know much about this at all.
* Roblox is known for its young audience
* Roblox is known for its microtransaction system that can give various benefits in games, much of which is cosmetic (""Robux"")
* Roblox has a chat message system and some pretty heavy censorship methods on it in an attempt to ensure safety.
* Some Roblox games have become somewhat popular (Garten of Banban, Dress to Impress, etc.)
* Roblox is somewhat associated with ""brainrot"" (I honestly don't know exactly what this means either, but something to do with short-form content and attention spans, I think).

Now, any one of these things might be enough to dislike the game or want your children away from it. However, the sentiments expressed in the linked post appear to go much further than any of this. They believe the platform is fundamentally harmful in some way, which is just confusing to me considering that Roblox has such variety in it. How does it all have the same basic flaw, whatever that is?

I also find it odd that one of the criteria is isolation from pop culture, yet Minecraft is seen as a viable alternative, despite it being arguably more pop-culture-ish (with a similar ""brainrot"" association), being similarly online, and having a similar microtransaction system (Minecoins, though not as prominent in-game).

I was perfectly content, and she seems to be as well.

It seems like I have missed something big here. Something that makes the game itself unsafe/predatory in a way that others aren't. What is this missing piece?",2024-11-13 03:39:33

Then this influencer saying Elon Musk used Starlink to hack the election seems to have gone viral: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFKU4KJ9/

I’ve seen the (unfinished) 15-20M voter turnout graph parroted on X, now being used to say there’s no way 15-20M people didn’t show up in swing states that won Trump the electoral college, but then voted in Democrat senators. I know the number is now closer to a 4M gap, which appears closer to swing voter estimates. The Morning Edition of NYT also came out with compelling reasons why Democrats won House and Senate seats in swing states due to messaging.

I can’t find any evidence to suggest Elon financially influenced voting machine hardware or software companies.

So, what’s pushing these rumors? Civil unrest? There’s usually *some*thing credible, even if it’s remote, that motivates the rumor mill.

**Marking this as Answered. Here’s the TL;DR for the curious:**

Links provided are screenshots of the comments I thought answered this.

Claims seem to be coming from the fact that Starlink was (allegedly?) used in certain counties as an ISP to collect votes. Special thanks to u/CapnDogWater for pointing that out:

Also, I'm gonna sound harsh here, but for a social media site that loves talking about how stupid people are in crowds, I'm surprised by how defensive people are of the American electorate on that subreddit as if there isn't some blame to be put on the lack of political education, considering a sudden surge in searches for policy AFTER the election ended.

Also I'm not Gen Z, but I've been seeing this sub on my main feed so much now that I had to check it out.

And based on what I've seen, and based what I've read in threads from other subreddits ... something feels seriously off. The amount of hateful rhetoric and divisive, emotionally charged dribble I've seen here is insane. Yes, I get the US had a terrible election result, and the voter turnout wasn't great. But it's not just Gen Z: Millions of people don't vote every election, which is mind boggling to me.

But compulsory vs non compulsory voting is another topic and I'm not quite here for that. What I am here for is to talk about the usual inflammatory themes I've seen on that subreddit which feel purposeful. I think they're being astroturfed.

Someone in an another discussion linked three very disturbing threads. There are several more but I'll dig into just these three for examples' sake.

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1glorvw/the\_solution\_for\_young\_men\_leaning\_to\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1glorvw/the_solution_for_young_men_leaning_to_right/)

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1gm7e55/what\_is\_wrong\_with\_this\_sub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1gm7e55/what_is_wrong_with_this_sub/)

Right off the bat, I see that these are very broad, vaguely worded posts, and I believe this is on purpose. The purpose is to illicit emotionally charged responses from the people here, irrespective of their ideological alignments. They rely on strawmen too.

* The first thread is literally only a screenshot of a twitter post. It's just a guy saying that Gen Z men need to die in the trenches. Now the guys will of course be offended at this bullshit. Why should they suffer because of someone else? You have to remember, this is Twitter.
   * It's a bumhole. This is just one troll saying something inflammatory to rile people up, then some other troll comes in and says ""see? this is what they want"". ""They"" being whoever in this case. This is disingenuous at the very least. But that's how trolling works.
* The second thread is overly simplistic. It tries to paint all Gen Z men being conservative. Well, Gen Z men where? Everywhere? The US only? Why? What could be the reasons?
   * nobody explores the what, where, who or why. All responses are generalising all Gen Z men. This is very much like the men vs women debacle I saw years ago during the GamerGate days, or the Anti-SJW dark ages of the mid 2000s.
   * I recognise the patterns. This is solely to pit men and women against each other.
* The third thread seems a bit more genuine, but it's very reactionary. It's looking at the world through the lens of what the people from the US are experiencing. That is, most likely an American person expressing their grief but blaming all groups equally, irrespective of their locations.
   * That is a very broad sweep.
   * Same concerns as above.

I have looked at the posting history of a a fair amount of accounts here. Only because I found them shady. I found that there were overlaps with shitposting subreddits, manosphere type bubbles and 4chan like trolling. I.E people who aren't being sincere to begin with.

I think they are being riled up to be divided further. After all, they already got the boomers and the Gen Xers, right? Now it's millennials and Gen Zers, because young people are the future. Young people are the last hope of any sort of unity, so these astroturfers will try to divide and conquer us.

That seems so weird to me. The election seemed like the most divisive it’s ever been, and either Republicans just voted for trump and then went blue for the senate? Or dems voted for trump, and went blue for the rest of their ticket?

In the past we even heard about there being a red mirage and a blue shift because of mail in ballots being counted later. 

I'm not saying that it would have been enough to change the course of the election but maybe enogh to change the demographic stats. Especially the young and latino votes.

I've tried to understand what's lead to these protests but I can't parse it.

I understand a train station awning collapsed and killed 14 but how did that spark mass protests? 

I read that some soccer holligans are involved but I don't know if they are supporting or opposing the protests. The protesters are also calling for arrests but who would you arrest in an accident like this?

How does this lead to mass mobilization but other infrastructure tragedies like the FIU bridge collapse kinda just happen.

So far there’s been no screenshots and evidence about this woman being the reporter. I’m still not sure why this specific woman was targeted. Any claims of evidence that I have seen have linked to fake accounts that popped up yesterday after the original woman shut down all her social media.

For those wondering why this has become so politicized here’s my take on what has happened:

1.	⁠A beloved TikTok squirrel and raccoon were revealed to be euthanized and taken away in the state of NY
2.	⁠MAGAs find out about this and make the jump that since NY is a blue state, this is proof that democrats are bad
3.	⁠An unsubstantiated rumor comes out that a female photographer from Texas is the one who called the NY Department of Environmental Conservation. Her name, address, and phone number are leaked and doxxed. She shuts down all her social media pages
4.	⁠MAGA supporters start spreading rumors that she’s a democract and a Harris supporter with no proof in order to further their agenda that democrats want to kill pet squirrels and raccoons. They start making fake Facebook and TikTok pages like the ones pictured here https://www.reddit.com/r/ParlerWatch/s/JPzPLUgDOH  further fuel this agenda. They posted fake posts under her name about supporting drag queens and Harris to make this issue political and fan the flames

What the fuck is going on here and why does it matter? How does everything tie together?

Is this actually true? It seems weird to me for these reasons:

What makes me think it's false:

1. If this is true, then why/how is this not the biggest news in the US right now?
2. The timing seems awfully convenient for transphobes; an employee of Mr. Beast comes out as trans, and he refuses to fire her, as some people demanded, and a few weeks later the accusations of this trans person being a pedophile come out.
3. Every single accusation about Mr. Beast that I have looked into previously (and there are a lot of them lately) turned out to be false.

What makes me think it's true:

1. Why/how are all these websites which are reporting this not being sued for defamation?
2. Supposedly this has been reported to the FBI. If it's not true, how does the person who reported this is not afraid to receive a felony for lying to the FBI?

I am not sure whether to trust the polls. Trump seems as unpopular as ever but that could be due to the circles of people I am around and not based on actual fact.

I remember back in 2020, seeing so many people vote for Biden in protest against Trump and because they wanted anyone else but him in office.

So if the same people who voted against in 2020 voted again, I would assume it'd be a similar result.

From what I've seen, it doesn't look like Trump has tried to reach out to voters outside of his base and has only doubled down on his partisanship so I am confused how the race is considered this close.

Were the polls and reports on the news saying that it was ""neck and neck"" or a tie back in 2020 as well?

I never played either of the games. I know some of the story from both, but I'm not a huge fan.

For some reason Reddit decided to show me posts from TLOU subreddits, and I see an incredible amount of people shitting in the game in the subreddits dedicated to the franchise, WITH HUNDREDS OF UPVOTES. So I thought, this is quite interesting...

Apparently, people are complaining about Neil Druckman and his alleged ""incompetence"" as a narrative lead. It looks the first game had another writer on, Bruce *Someonesson*, and they apparently unfollowed each other on twitter after the first game came out? So, a lot of users imply that the genius came from this other writer, and not from Bruce.

There seems to be a lot of consensus on what works in the game, and what doesn't. I'm just curious to know what that's all about, if there's any coherent info in the behind the scenes, or long form critique, and stuff like that. As an aspiring writer, I'm quite intersted in all this stuff more than I am about the story of the game.

There have been evil men in world history, but when 4-Star Generals -within two weeks of an election-compare him to the #1 evil man in world history in the last 200+ years, that should make you take fuckin' notice.

I'm not saying this isn't true or anything, but all I'm finding is that one of his former Chief of Staff is warning voters not to vote for him, and that he used to be a military general. Surely this isn't the whole story as that hardly counts as ""The Military"" so I'm just wondering; are there more notable people who are higher ups in the military who have also said not to vote for him?

\^ \^ \^ \^ \^ Trump rumored to have spoken over 7 times with Putin

Very general question. I keep hearing more articles, especially recently, of how much Donald Trump talked to Putin, and even in the past. So much news, in fact, you'd think they're besties or something.

So can someone explain the whole motivation of *why* he would talk to Putin? In my head, making him out as a bad guy seems like the most obvious thing to do. Russia provides nothing as far as I know to the US, and vise versa. If you have to, you can literally boil it down to ""Russia bad.""

I understand it's really bad if it is true. Confidential information being shared, secret world leader plans or something, etc., but what exactly is the theory everyone is getting at here..?",2024-10-13 11:17:18

While I admired the trailer, I never really planned on watching it, so therefore I haven't been keeping up with it. Well apparently the first two episodes were finally released, but while the first episode was critically acclaimed, the second one seems to be panned. I mean, just take a look at the official trailer from a month ago, and look at the difference between the positive comments from a month ago and the negative ones from a few days ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ivmweJQaco&ab\_channel=AdultSwim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ivmweJQaco&ab_channel=AdultSwim)

I’m out of the loop and genuinely want to know: what’s the reasoning for voting against the funding bill? 

And what’s really going on on the ground? Are sheriffs getting involved? Is FEMA withholding aid or stopping lay supporters from coming to help? I honestly don’t know, but i could understand if they did for, say, safety reasons etc?

I know these politicians don’t have a pathological desire to see Floridians die. There must be a reason for their votes against the funding, from their perspective? And to blame FEMA (and to say that HAARP is causing these larger hurricanes).

My Q-adjacent folks keep saying ‘extra fluff in the bills’. But i can’t seem to find specifics as to what that fluff might be? AND even if i could…is it better to not fund FEMA over them (especially if they appear to be so negligent as to be hard to find specifics!)? 

It seems similar to me to the immigration situation. GOP aren’t incentivized to fix the problem and vote against border bills etc “because of fluff” and because their master says to do so…but, presumably rationally by their own rhetoric, if immigration is what’s killing the country (which, to be clear, I’m not saying), would passing the bill not outweigh the fluff?

""I will never look at it the same way again, so I listen to it for the last time and remove it from all my playlists. As a country, we owe a life to Iqbal, Ayşenur and all other women.

Man and his wife go to Disney, wife has a severe allergy, they go to a restaurant that is on the Disney property (Disney is the landlord, from what I gathered and not affiliated with the restaurant), the couple informs the waiter of the severe allergy multiple times, waitress reassures them, wife unfortunately passes due to a severe allergic reaction. 


That’s the gist but I have one question that hasn’t been answered, and I can’t find the answer since it’s being buried by the Disney plus thing. 



Is the husband ONLY suing Disney? Or is he suing Disney as a liable party due to the restaurant on Disney’s property, but primarily suing the restaurant for negligence?

Tried looking here, but it doesn't mention the prevalence of the phrase or the change in how it's used in recent years: [https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/lets-go/](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/lets-go/)

I remember growing up that fans would cheer in stadiums singing ""Let's go, let's go, let's go \*clap clap\*"", or army officers in movies shouting, ""Let's go!"", or coaches rallying a bunch of guys to get them hyped up before a play shouting ""Let's go!"" This use of the phrase made sense to me because you're urging people to ""go"" towards a desired end result and spurring them on. Fans would also say this while their favorite team is winning and making plays, excited that they are ""going"" and driving towards a win.

However, at some point, I kept hearing people shouting ""Let's go"" at the END of a game, like after their team wins, or after they beat a final boss, or every time they finish a level. This is so confusing to me, because you've already ""gone"" and done what you wanted to do. There's nowhere left to ""go"" because you've finished, unless you're already looking ahead to doing something else after this, but I'm pretty sure that not what they're thinking about when they say, ""Let's go"".

Does anyone know when the trend started to change?",2024-10-07 20:44:50
