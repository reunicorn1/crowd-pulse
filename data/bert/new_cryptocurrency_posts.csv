For more information about Moons, please [see our wiki page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki). 

We are using Snapshot for voting directly with the Moon balance in your wallet, in a transparent and open manner. For now all Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Monday. You can [see our schedule here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i0e5as6q033nruqck5c9nfk24k%40group.calendar.google.com).**Please review the following important information first:**

* Successful polls are implemented whenever the responsible party has a chance to do it. Usually this is within days or weeks of the poll passing, but depends on workload, priorities, and complexity of implementation. You can look at implementation status on [the CCIP list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhhqB4UAezNMdAwjV3evFXPD2x1JFCFHdnm8rmyRqAE/edit?usp=sharing)
* In the event of incompatible polls passing, the poll with more Moons voting in favor will be considered the winner and the other will not be implemented.

The idea of timing the market of course is nothing short of ridiculous, and we all know that we want to sell the cringe alts and convert them to BTC when everything goes down, since BTC loses least value and is an absolute beast as we can already see from the charts and the adoption.

So, I'm even having second thoughts right now, I want to unstake everything so I can be ready to sell, December or March 2025 doesn't matter. I don't know about you guys but I won't lose more than 700-800USD from the APY for 4-5 months. Well unless of course the alts absolutely skyrocket, then these 7-8% APY are quite a loss, it may even cost me 2000 USD for 4 months if all the alts go beyond the previous ATH.

It's not always gonna follow tech.

It's not always gonna be about what project could solve the trilemma better, what is more decentralized, what has better smart contracts, etc...

# -The most significant factor as we get deeper into a bullrun will be hype and trend, the more the market gets emotional.

We're gonna see some great projects not get much love, and some flawed ones or even meme or shitcoins get more hype.

Bullruns are emotional and work more like Instagram trends than on technical merit. The deeper we get into them, the less they have rhyme or reason. 

# -Don't fight the trend.

Trends are your friend. Once they carry momentum, it's hard for them to stop.

When the market has its mind set on a narrative or a trend, it's hard to undo that.

# -There are times where tech and hype can overlap, if the narrative is right.

In the short run, when you're speculating on just a bullrun, better tech only works if there's some hot hype to go with it. Some bell and whistles, or something that can be marketed easily about that tech that will still catch the interest of the average person who is clueless about tech.

We've seen in past runs how tech like ALGO that was hyped as carbon neutral, Solana for its incredible speed, ADA as based on science, MATIC as something that can make Ethereum faster and cheaper, and many chains like AVAX hyped as ""Ethereum killers"", had simple digestible concepts to hype them.

Which is not to say that the hype didn't come from actual merit, but from something easily sellable to an average person.

It can take up to 30 days to unstake some cryptos before you can sell/ transfer it.

I'm not advising anyone to sell their assets during this period however consider when you need to do this prior to your target sell date/timeline. 

The last thing you want is to stare at your balance shoot down or up and be unable to utilize.

Please be aware of some of the most popular Scams:

# Youtube ads, most commonly about ""doubling your money"".

I have gotten tons of these on my mobile device in the past two weeks. Usually regarding XRP or Solana ""Giving back to the community"" - Send us your funds and we'll send you back double. It's literally a doubling money scam with a new face.

# MEV Bot Scams

This one gets advertised a lot on Youtube as well. Idea is to download a trading bot that will allow you to make money passively by sandwiching users with high Slippage. However you download the bot and then get drained, **seriously if you ever see something about this it's a scam, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT**. Nobody with a good sandwich bot will give it to you, or they would lose potential income from that bot by allowing other users to trade it.

# Stupidly high APR (commonly advertised on Instagram)

This one is targeted at greedy amateurs and offer stupidly high APR like 2-3% per day for staking ETH. However it's a scam and when you set it up they just drain your wallet.

# Reddit Chat Scams

Seriously if you get chat requests on Reddit about Crypto they're a scammer:

# Fake Exchange Email and Phone Call Scams

This one is just pure social engineering. Sending an Email or Phone Call pretending to be an exchange saying something is urgently wrong and trying to get you to provide 2fa information for the scammer to access your exchange account and drain you.

# Classic Pig Butchering

A long term scam where someone messages you in an unsolicited way then works to build report with the idea that you eventually invest in a Scam Crypto Exchange. This one never stopped and you should be aware of it, but the other scams above are on the uptick.",2024-11-11 18:07:40

With the recent launch of BlackRock's ETFs, I am considering pulling the trigger and moving away from self-custody. 

I am confident in my decision, but what I want to understand more is the downfalls of these ETFs in terms of what I want to be investing in. To elaborate, the IBIT and ETHA are both BlackRock's spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. From what I understand, a spot ETF is required to actually hold the cryptocurrency itself - that is, buying these ETFs is direct exposure to the Coin. 

From viewing comparison tools of BTC-USD vs IBIT and ETH-USD and ETHA these graphs are correlated, but it is not a perfect correlation (70-90%). I want to understand is why it's not a perfect correlation, is it because it's lagging? What else makes these spot ETFs not a perfect correlation that I need to consider in moving away from self-custody? 

In simpler terms, if one person held 1 BTC equivalent within IBIT, and another held 1 BTC as self-custody, who would make more money and why (exclude fees), or would any discrepancies be negligible? ",2024-11-11 21:42:43

This time i feel might be different. There's much bigger volumes and institutional players involved.

The trust appears to have a premium issue too, with people on the r/litecoin  group bringing up the fact the premium to NAV is almost 210% right now. So you have a very expensive product coupled with the fact it's down from $46 during the March FOMO peak to $13.99 now. It was also $400 in previous halving cycles.

If you are not shorting the Litecoin Trust you are basically missing out on free money here. It's laughable.",2024-11-12 14:35:55

Update: Friend confirmed he got the payments. First was in cash (a small amount) then the second payment was the transfer of BTC. I'm pretty sure, based on you guys' previous posts here, that my Friend received more than he initially told me. He lost 60+ btc at the time of Mt Gox crash. He might have gotten 10 btc from the settlement I read. That was a few months ago. 

I advised him not to sell when this was on the way.  He listened apparently. He sold a very small amount he said. To throw a party. It wasn't outrageous and he didn't advertise it was from his btc settlement. He kept it lowkey and just threw himself a bday celebration with a lot of his friends and their families. Modest food and drinks provided.  

I'm guessing he sold 1 or 2 btc, but maybe less. I'm guessing he's sitting on 8+ bitcoin right now. With the rate things are going post-election, that'll be worth $1M+ in a couple months potentially. He only works part-time now, he doesn't need the salary, but he does need the social interaction and community that it provides. He is independently wealthy, single, early 40s, and lives alone. Seems pretty happy but hasn't let it go to his head or changed his lifestyle in a big way. He loves playing sports. 

This guy is the only one I know IRL who had this happen to him, and who owns this much btc, and who does not need to work full-time and be in the rat race of life. It's an incredible story. The dude won. He's still winning. Obviously he needs to sell at the right time to officially have that money in the bank.  I'm glad that I know someone who beat the casino, even though he originally had 6x more, but he def woulda sold much earlier instead of this forced hodl strategy. Anyone else know someone who this happened to? What would you do if this was your life? I'd probably eff it all up",2024-11-11 02:13:41

In 2020 pre bull to 2021 Bull year BTC 2.37 X‚Äôd

Both Pre year Bull highs happened in December. Both were 30% and 75% higher than their November 2016 and 2020 monthly highs.

It will be very interesting to see what Novembers actual high will be in 2024. I‚Äôm conservatively thinking approximately 85,000 in November and approximately 20% increase in December to a 102,000. Based on that estimate and a 2 to 2.5X would be about 204,000 to 255,000.. just a guesstimate as we could also see some additional catalysts with the general favorable acceptance from the new presidency.

We‚Äôve jumped from $60k to $80k BTC quickly over the last few days but it is clear that the average retail person is not here yet.  I think it will take Bitcoin close to or above $100k for a week before retail investors start to pay attention.  So far this bull run I believe it‚Äôs mostly just been people here from last cycle and paying attention over the last couple of years.  WE‚ÄôRE STILL EARLY PEOPLE!

I have an Android phone, and I put the app in the secure folder (as you should, more locks wouldn't hurt), created a backup on the Google drive, which allows access to recovery phrase, etc and forgot about the wallet for a while.

Yesterday, I opened the app to make sure that I still got access to it, and I did. Everything looked fine, so I copied the address and send a bit of crypto first. Received, very well. Sent more. Finally, when I wanted to swap crypto to some tokens, it prompted a fingerprint, so I pressed it and the error popped up ""Face recognition is not available"" (even though it was a fingerprint prompt). I tried again, nothing. Well, it turns out that the app doesn't work in the secure folder. It has never been mentioned neither on the website nor on the app page in Google store. I couldn't access the seed phrase either, because it also prompts the fingerprint that doesn't work. I should have not relied on the app and tried it in the first place but you never assume something like that can happen with a renown wallet. The funny part is that the backup doesn't work properly, and it didn't save it at all 

So, I never lost access to my account, it was not stolen but the app was just straight up broken. Surely, not their fault since I should have written the seed phrase, but they should make the app work properly in the first place as well. Anyways, moving along, just letting you know that these guys won't take responsibility for anything and technically I was wrong for trusting the app. Beware, if you have a choice, choose something else.

TDLR Rainbow wallet turns out to be not working at all if you put in the Secure folder. I was blamed for not being more cautious.",2024-11-12 00:57:47

**What is ACP-125?**

ACP-125 proposes reducing the base transaction fee from 25 nAVAX to just 1 nAVAX (96% reduction).The reason for this is most blocks are being created at the base fee level. This indicates that users are paying the base price just because that is what it is set to but not necessarily what is needed. ACP-125 is going to dynamically adjust fees so users pay what is needed to process blocks.

**ACP-125 will do all of the following;**

\- Increase efficiency

\- Make AVAX more accessible globally

\- Rapidly grow the network- Increase competitiveness with other L1s

Take a look at how much I would have saved in gas using my own wallet

  
Since 2021 I have spent 92.16 AVAX in gas.  Once ACP-125 is introduced I would have only spent 40.5 AVAX.  This would have saved me over $1900 USD at today's prices.

I don't know about you, but that is a huge savings over time that I would like to put work elsewhere in the ecosystem.

[Potential gas savings in my own wallet](https://preview.redd.it/qj3770inq70e1.png?width=3398&format=png&auto=webp&s=576c13f0457aff09444c1b7af7ba1db8f0e81968)

  
**What happens when fees are reduced?**

When BASE reduced its fees by over 95% in the first week there was a rise in daily transactions by 82%!

The potential impact that could have on the AVAX ecosystem once ACP-125 is implemented are MASSIVE!

Some of the projections based on historical fee reductions show that there could be anywhere between 39-80% increase in daily transactions, along with daily address growth of up to 200%!

That certainly would help rapidly grow the Avalanche Ecosystem coming off the heels of major partnership announcements.

**Why is ACP-125 so important for AVAX?**

**Become the L1 of choice:** 

We have seen many L1s launching over the years and they all need a competitive edge. 

Having the lowest fees certainly puts AVAX as a top contender.

We have already seen partnership in many sectors such as the CA DMV and so many other pictured below.

The United States is going to crack down on government spending and efficiency with Trump and Elon at the helm.

If any blockchain was positioned to take advantage of this, AVAX has to be a frontrunner with partnerships already in line and soon with even lower fees.

This is only one part of the overall improvements coming to Avalanche as part of Avalanche 9000, and with the supercycle upon us, the timing could not have been better!

[Recent AVAX Partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/v3xryfc2r70e1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b88e0657bd65344871dd64c1619152bee004ac)

This is just part of the overall plan in Avalanche 9000 to improve the network on multiple fronts to capitalize on the numerous partnerships and growth opportunities that have developed overt he last year.

I think there is a significant repricing coming soon to AVAX in the upcoming months and a large part of it is due to these upgrades coming before the end of the year.

I guess it's safe to say we are in the bull market right now. Yet most altcoins holders are still far way from break even.

In my case I bought Polkadot in 2021 near ATH and dca until average price was 24$.

From what we learn all these years we slhoud DCA in during bears and dca out during bears.

But I still feel it's way to early to dca out. But the truth is nobody can predict the future. Nobody knows. What we know it's that there's no shame in selling in profit, and **everyone who HODL BITCOIN is in profit**. 

I still don't have an exit strategy but I'm pretty much conviced that I won't reach break even with Polkadot.",2024-11-11 19:36:04

cryptocurrency,1gozkne,How do you make money with crypto???,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gozkne/how_do_you_make_money_with_crypto/,47,"In the last year finance and investing got my attention and i informed myself, already also have my own investments. But i also am curious about investing in crypto, but i just dont see how you can predict to make money in crypto? So for assets like an ETF or some real estate i can understand, for example in the stock market you KNOW the stock market is probably going to rise like 10% every year as long as the US economy keeps up with the world economy, because (if i understood this correctly) a share is just the valuation of a company and every company wants to become more valuable and get more profit wich is why the stock market is going up like 10% every year. Real estate i can also understand, finding an undervalued property and renting it out, selling it because the prices get higher when its undervalued etc etc.

But i dont understand crypto. So if we look at the developement it went up and down and up and down then down for a long period and now really up again. But i dont see how it goes long-term-always-up like the stock market. How can you make long-term gains? (Im not interested in daytrading, i think its too stressfull, risky, time-consuming and barely has an impact without leverage)

So one pattern you could see here is that it always goes down and then up again. So logical would be to just wait until it goes down by much again and buy and when it goes up by like 50% sell, then wait for it to drop, repeat. Is this good? How do you make long-term profits? Cause for me idk how i should predict this. Especially with Ethereum the course seems like a giant roller coaster. Are meme coins worth to buy? They just seem like a gamble to me.",2024-11-11 18:40:58

My guess is they‚Äôll start with large corporations, businesses ‚Äî from the top all the way down so that citizens are then incentivized/forced to use them.


I for one do not believe in coincidences, especially considering how well BTC has quickly adapted.

I guess my question here is: 

Do you truly believe in your deep subconscious  the way that Bitcoin operates this well and how quickly it adapts, becomes more and more secure by the minute is a coincidence? How it goes up significantly every 4 years like clockwork is a coincidence?

Knowing what we know about the US government and considering how they are the largest holders of BTC is not on purpose?

I'm watching everyone make money in crypto, and here I am, broke and unable to do anything. As a blockchain/Web3 nerd, it hurts. Back in 2023, when prices were low, I was struggling to get a job as a content creator (my professional niche) until a local crypto exchange took a chance on me for a content writer role in October.

I thought back then that this was my chance to get in before the bull run starts in 2024. But unfortunately, I lost that job due to a personal incident at the end of March 2024. I had invested some of my savings from my salary payouts into crypto but had to liquidate my positions in April to repay some debts (I'm still not debt-free) and I needed cash.

Since then, I've landed a few interviews but didn't get past the final hurdle to bag an offer. Now, the bull run is in full swing with the Trump pump, but I cannot take advantage of it. I'm in talks with a couple of companies right now, and even if I get a job soon, crypto is too expensive to invest in and is only going to get more expensive as time goes by. It's safe to say that I've missed the boat.

Sorry, I had to get this off my chest. I hope you guys get rich and fulfill all your dreams and goals. I'll watch from the sidelines.",2024-11-11 09:39:54

The bull is returning and that means lots of newbies are being attracted. Here's some tips so that you dont make fatal mistakes and lose your money. Please feel free to contribute more!

1. Trust nothing and verifying everything. Everything is trying to scam you. Any DM, random tweet, text message, email..etc. They all need to be double and triple checked. When in doubt, dont interact. Check directly on said platform.
2. ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"". You didn't win anything, nothing is free, they are not gonna ""double your money""..etc. Its all a scam. Refer back to #1.
3. Never click random links. Refer back to #1.
4. **Never EVER** share your seed phrase. Refer back to #1.
5. Add 2FA to all your accounts. I like google authenticator.
6. DEFI/self custody is NOT beginner friendly and you can easily lose your money. Permanently.  There is no customer support.
7. If you choose to do self custody/defi - Make sure you save your seed phrases somewhere safe, go slow and refer back to #1.
8. It's okay to use mainstream platforms like Robinhood and coinbase. Just make sure you have all security functions turned on.
9. When using a mainstream CEX like coinbase, always use ""advanced trading"" and set limit orders. Exchanges make a ton of money off beginners using the basic ""buy crypto"" function.
10. When performing functions, never ""assume"" anything. For example: Always verify the network and wallet address you are sending and receiving money on. If you send money to wrong wallet or using wrong network - that money is **GONE**. Everything must be in alignment.
11. Beware of high APY offerings.  ""150%APY..etc"". Its never sustainable and often serves as bait for exit liquidity. Refer to #1 and #2.
12. Profit is nothing until its realized. Selling and re-entering at the next dip is a tremendous play.",2024-11-09 17:55:40

DCA on all positions regardless of the price, which right now is very high? Wait for the markets to settle and then take it from there?
