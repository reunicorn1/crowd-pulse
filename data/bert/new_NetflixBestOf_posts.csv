I am not incredibly familiar with a myriad of UFO cases, or up to date on it. As a viewer, I simply find it interesting. I liked that the focus of the first episode was different. Not the typical well, are they there or not. It’s a different approach. 

My belief is this…I don’t know if these things are connected to aliens or not. However, I believe the universe is too vast, and it would be arrogant to think we are the only intelligent beings living in it.

I see the Netflix search result, click it, and start watching.  
  
The episode was pretty good (of course, it's Kristen Bell!), but it felt like there was a lot of missing context/info, which we figured would get filled in as the show progressed. We get to the end of the episode, and as the credits roll, it says ""Season 2 is on the way!"" (or similar). WHAAAAAT???
   
Well, it turns out, Roku (or Netflix) search took us to the LAST episode of the series! And no, no one had watched any episodes -- there were clearly no completed episodes in the list (and it's not a shared profile, and there's no one else in our house). I've used search that way a million times and that has never happened to me. So weird.  
  
So, we decided we'll just have to treat the whole series as a flashback. 2 episodes in now, it doesn't feel like anything is too ruined. Very strange, has this ever happened to anyone? Will definitely watch out for this in the future.",2024-11-03 12:08:52

Are you team Carol or team Linda? 

Well, my stance on this has always been that this universe is too vast. So, surely we can’t be the only living intelligent beings in it.

More than that, I cannot tell you. I dont know anything with 100% certainty and I leave it at that. Im fine with it.

Linda certainly makes a captivating subject, as Carol originally thought. I dont really see what the motive would be for her to lie? But, people have done far worse for no reason.

Apparently she has sued Netflix recently for defaming her because she thought this would all be presented differently. Hmm, so🤔

We tend to like more thinky horror movies that are less super natural based and more real mental health based.   
  
An example because I probably explained that poorly or didn't use the exact right wording, we really like the babaadook- sorry spoilers- because of how it was a metaphor for mental health issues and how the horror came from seeing the mother slowly losing her sanity and stability and acting out in a more crazed way. Another example, we really like saw because of how, if your smart (Im not at all XD but they are so help me follow along), you can follow the plans and see how it fits together and whats going to happen. A final example being tarot, we liked it because the entire movie was kind spoiled through the tarot reading and if you paid attention to them you could predict what was going to happen and it was really cool seeing it come together like it was said to.

I hope I got the idea across, feel free to ask clarification if I didn't explain something well enough, but do you know any Netflix horror movies that would fit these criteria? Thanks for your time!",2024-10-30 18:49:40

I wasn’t sure that I was going to watch this true crime doc, even though I love true crime. I guess because a part of me felt that I got what I needed from the film, and I agreed with the film’s conclusion on who did it.

Then I told myself, ok, even if Ive never been that interested in the zodiac killings, let me give it a shot.

It was actually not bad. We get some new perspective and points of view on everyone’s favorite suspect for the case.

I have to say though…I knew after watching Fincher’s film that someone out there definitely knew more and one day that person would say something. Just a matter of time.

Just finished watching Kaos and it was excellent! It's been a while since. I watched a show that is so creative. Especially in the way Greek mythology is re-imagined for the present day. Every time a new character pops up you think ""Uuuu, I wonder how they will play with that god/human's myth"" and it's always cool. 

The cast was also amazing. Jeff Goldblum is a perfect Trump-esque Zeus, but he doesn't overpower the cast, all the rest of the cast were also great.

It opens up for a second season in a cool way but it is a worthwhile story in itself, give it a try! ",2024-10-23 18:24:08

Looking for seriously scary movie or show.
Don't like the sudden screams and such.

I watched the haunting of hill house, and it was meh. Give me something scary please.


Update: I have these streaming services: Netflix, Peacock, HBO with ad, and Amazon prime as well.

I want something close to real life, something to scare me so much to not be able to sleep with the lights off. I assume exorcist would be a good candidate, but I've watched most of them in the past. 

Watching Marianne right now. I'll update my opinion in here once finished.



Update2: watched Marianne, it definitely worth it! Has some real life concepts used in it, that I kinda could relate to the ghost stories of my childhood.



Update 3: watched the midnight mass. it is a horror genre, but not scary at all. Totally regret the time I spent.",2024-10-15 06:11:04

They have to have fantasy premises. For example:

*Lucifer.* Episodic detective show with supernatural elements (male lead is the devil).

*iZombie.* Episodic detective show with fantasy/sci-fi elements (female lead is a zombie).

*Continuum*. Mostly episodic cop show with sci-fi elements (female lead is a time traveller).

I know it's weirdly specific but these kinds of shows are hard to come by, do you have any suggestions? Preferably with a female lead.

Netflix is optimal but other platforms are okay.

  
Edit:

Thanks everyone for making suggestions. But there are few things to clarify. In my current state I can only watch epsodic shows, where each episode is just another crime that need to be solved, with a few main arc plot advancements. Serial shows that depict a integral story arc like Dark, Resident Alien and The Devil's Hour are not what I'm currenly looking for.

Also, since I'm looking for cop and detective show with a supernatual/sci-fi premise. Not purely supernatural/scifi show. By that I mean people using supernatrual or sci-fi ability or tools to solve mundane everyday cases in modern times, not those specialize on supernatrual cases or happens in sci-fi future/cyperpunk settings.

So far, the only ones that fits those criterias are Forever and The Dead Zone. I really liked Forever but too bad it got cancelled.

Koreans have very great concepts and they put great effort and budget to materialize and bring the concept to life. There are a couple of things I love about their reality shows. One is that there’s no unnecessary drama (unlike most of Filipino reality shows that we have 🙈). The challenges are well thought of. The production looks and sounds expensive. The research and the casting is on point. The judging is very objective and fair. The contestants are not sore losers. And they are all courteous and well-mannered.

I hope Season 2 comes soon!

P. S. My personal favorites are 1. Triple Star (super beautiful and talented guy!) 2. Edward Lee (he’s so cool like a senpai and very creative) 3. Cooking Maniac (i like his vibe) 4. Napoli Matfia (1st dish impressions lasts)

No other documentary or Law & Order episode I've seen, or article I've ever read, made this connection so evident - and Ryan Murphy didn't either, though he did narrativize this particular event:

Minutes before they killed their parents, the boys had a verbal fight with Kitty and José (when José told Lyle that Eric was ""his son, and \[he\] would do whatever he wanted with him"" or similar).

José then told Lyle to leave the house, and Eric to ""wait for him upstairs.""

So even if the argument can be made that Kitty and José were not, in fact, going to kill their sons then (and as I understand, this would be the argument for 'imperfect self-defense' and therefore a manslaughter conviction instead of Murder 1)...

I know that evil exists obviously, but I just can’t wrap my head around this entire story.

I’m in search of some fresh TV series to dive into and would love your recommendations. To give you an idea of my taste, here are some of my all-time favorites:

- The Americans
- La Casa de Papel
- Berlin 
- Breaking Bad (didn’t enjoy Better Call Saul as much)  
- The Diplomat
- Patriot
- Tokyo Vice
- Boardwalk Empire
- Ozark
- Mosquito Coast
- Narcos
- Peaky Blinders
- Black Sails
- For All Mankind
- Dark
- The Gentlemen
- Weeds
- Happy Valley
- The Wire

I also love documentaries, especially those by Mads Brügger that tackle contemporary societal issues.

I guess I’m into a mix of thrillers, crime dramas, historical series, and some lighter, more feel-good shows. I’m particularly drawn to well-crafted, intense narratives with great character development. However, I’m not really into sci-fi or true crime, so I’d prefer to avoid those genres.

Another (sort of) example is Kevin Can Fuck
Himself. Allison is a goody two shoes and Patty is a more hardened drug dealer. But there are instances throughout where Allison is able to carry out immoral tasks without them affecting her but they leave Patty traumatized.

There's also the Dragon Prince with Claudia and Viren. Claudia started off really bubbly and sweet. Viren is colder and has already delved into dark magic. But later Viren is shocked at Claudia's capability for evil and she surpasses him as a dark magician.

Most of them will be bad. 

But it isn’t like there’s one metric that can accurately filter all the bad movies out. Every high budget movie isn’t good, and although most low budget movies are bad, there’s always that gem in the pile of trash. 

And ratings are absolutely useless. A highly rated movie might still be trash. A low rated movie may be a cult classic, and the best movie you’ve ever seen. 

And there’s no telling if a newer movie would be better than an older movie. Usually, it’s the opposite or maybe that’s just survivorship bias. 

Actors and actresses often times is a good indicator but even that isn’t bullet proof. Case in point, Bryan Cranston in Your Honor. Absolute trash, but one of the best actors of a generation. 

So if you can’t use budget, ratings, movie release date or the actors/actresses in the movie, how do you predict if a movie or tv show will be good without wasting hundreds of hours watching bad movies and tv shows? ",2024-09-25 14:00:37
