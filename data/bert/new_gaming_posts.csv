Now that I've seen how the sausage is made and understand the motivations of its creators, I want them to avoid it like the plague. It's futile to articulate to them why it's bad and I clearly don't want them to resent me for taking away something they love, so I figured that the best strategy to go about it is to replace it with a novelty.

Roblox is the amalgamation of everything that's wrong with the gaming industry and our brain rotting ethos, but I really don't want to get into it. IYKYK, and if you don't know, I'm sure many others have talked about it before.

I'm looking for a game that's

* Easy to get-started and play
* Supports local co-play (no online play)
* Offers novelity in every playthrough (this is key) 
* No micro transactions
* Designed purely for enjoyment and not to make a quick buck by exploiting kids' attention and dopamine production 
* Isolated from our pop culture 
* Supported on Mac OS
* Something that can be enjoyable in 1 hour playthrough (their daily screen time allotment)

They have Minecraft and used to like it, but stopped playing it altogether since Roblox was introduced.

I’d like to get him a new one for Christmas! But I don’t know what to get. I’ve included a picture of his old one— I think it was a mid-range or maybe a cheaper keyboard. I know it was Bluetooth (it had a little Bluetooth USB chip that plugged into his PC), and that he got a real kick out of it being able to light up in different colors— though he didn’t use this function a lot.

I know some gamers are particular about the way their keyboard “clicks,” if that makes any sense. Just in case, I’d like to get him something with a similar click quality, but I’d also like to know what’s out there rather than just get him the exact same one.

Split screen gaming is almost totally absent in AAA titles in 2024. 

I got an Xbox Series X about this time last year. Generally, it has been great. I already have a PC which I use to work from home, so its nice to have a separate console to play games on. That being said, I was shocked to see how few games even have the capability of splitscreen. With game pass there's barely games that can handle splitscreen, the majority of them having been made in the past. Overall, with two people it wasn't a huge deal. My girlfriend and I have been able to find a game here or there to occupy our time. She's more of a watcher than a player anyways, so it all works out.

This weekend though, I had my friends over and we were hoping to play BO6 all together on the same screen. Though we've played plenty online, its a total different experience playing on the same screen hanging out together. We load up BO6 and are shocked to find you can only have 2 player split screen. Whatever, we all decided to just deal with it and do some 2 Player Zombies. Only to find out that split screen Zombies is incredibly buggy and only barely works. Constant bugs, rounds not passing, UI bugging out, etc. Apparently, the CoD franchise has been like this for a year or two now but seriously? I have always thought of games like CoD to be the ultimate choice for splitscreen multiplayer. Its not like it is difficult technology or expensive to implement, there is just no money to be made by putting splitscreen into your game I guess. With games like CoD beginning to phase out splitscreen functionalities, it feels like splitscreen gaming is just a thing of the past. Seems like Nintendo is the only real AAA company focusing on the social, splitscreen multiplayer aspect of gaming. Indie games like Plate Up! provide some great fun, but these split screen/cooperative gems seem harder and harder to come by. I got a console for the easier, splitscreen social gaming experience, but now I'm left wondering what the appeal of a console even is anymore if you already have a gaming PC. I remember when I was younger, it seemed like every single game had some split screen capabilities. Now its rare to find a game with any splitscreen at all, let alone a full part of 4 or more.",2024-11-11 21:49:26

I read that the AW had à fan on the back, how noisy is it ? Enough to be heard by the person working on the other side ?

And secondly, any enemy you see is inherently hostile. It doesn't matter if it are the Cleaners, the LMB, the Rikers, Hyenas, Outcasts, True Sons or local thugs, they all shoot at you without any provocation. There is no instance in the game were you can walk past them peacefully without getting attacked.

There were basically a half dozen playlists and a half dozen maps to play them on. Tons of content was missing and it was a slap in the face. 

Fast forward 3 years later…it’s a fun game! The gunplay has never been better. They have a match composer. Fun custom games if that’s what you’re in to. They added a “Delta Halo” playlist in honor of Halo 2’s
Twentieth Anniversary and it uses old school Halo movement (no sprint or jump) and they added a new gun. 

If you were ever a fan of the series or are looking for a casual FPS to play then Infinite is what’s up. It’s got a great gameplay loop and you should give it a shot!

gaming,1gpvxmq,All my games going weird on fullscreen - PC,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1gpvxmq/all_my_games_going_weird_on_fullscreen_pc/,14,"(PC Post)

I've got a really weird issue that's come up, and it's affecting **every single game** I have:

If I set a game to be Windowed, it runs in full screen (but it does run without going black).

If I set a game to Full Screen, the whole display goes black while there's any keyboard, mouse or controller input whatsoever. Changing menus? Black for 15-20 seconds. One mouse click? Black for another 15-20 seconds.  
However, if I alt-tab and have the game minimized in the background, I can preview what's happening by hovering over the tab to bring up that mini window, and everything is running normal - controller inputs are working, it's not going black. As soon as I open it back up again, black unless I do absolutely nothing for 15-20 seconds.

At first I thought it might be a game-specific bug - I was playing Ready or Not and it had recently installed a major update. But the super weird thing is it was exactly the same for every other game I tried as well - Planet Coaster, PUBG, TheHunter COTW, Arma3 - all of them, new and old. They all play full screen when it's supposed to be windowed, and they all go black on any input when it's set to full screen.

I've done the whole clean GPU driver install, it's not made a shred of difference. This is the weirdest glitch I've had, and it's just started now after running this computer for about 6 years. Has anyone else had this? I'm really confused.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for your suggestions, I am working through them. So far, it does not appear to be a monitor, V sync or DSC issue. I’ll continue trying fixes and will keep this thread updated.",2024-11-12 21:24:19

(examples include Halo, HalfLife 1, Starcraft, etc.)  I get it. These are good games, popular and highly respected, but they are not what I would call ""ahead of their time"". To be ahead of it's time, the game simply needs to introduce concepts or elements that are not imediately picked-up. It does not even need be good or remarkable - it just needs to have elements that are so new and unusual that it goes unappreciated and forgotten. Here are three examples of games that I consider ahead of their time...

The Outfoxies:  a totally different take on the arcade fighter game (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, etc.)  that became the inspiration for Super Smash Bros. many years later. The message at the start of each match ""Kill your oppenent by any means available"" meant the player could use whatever was lying around in the unusual and sometimes comical settings. A knife, a pipe, a gun, a grenade, frying pan,  a pot of hot soup,  or an electric eel tank (and so many more!) were all options! 

Warrior of Rome II: a pseudo RTS for the Sega Genesis that had a window interface and strong focus on unit management. Units got stronger and became specialized with experience, so the player needed to track unit progress and plan how to use them to be successful. I have never seen this feature fully re-implemted in any RTS I have played since.

Populous The Begining:  A 3D sequel to the original Populous with deformable terrain and a novel, intuitive order & message queue, way back in 1998! 

So, tell me what other forgotten (or soon to be forgotten) games that are out there that were so innovative that few people realize what they witnessed?

gaming,1go2po4,I wanna apologize to the entire gaming community for doubting that EA sucks.,2453,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1go2po4/i_wanna_apologize_to_the_entire_gaming_community/,382,"
All these years I've seen a plethora of posts, videos etc. online, either serious or humorous ones, about EA being greedy as hell while putting the lowest effort possible. I always thought that people were just being overdramatic or said all that so they can make their joke. But yesterday I realized that behind all the memes, articles there was truth to be found. And they weren't just true, they were VERY true.

I had bought Mass Effect Legendary Edition during the Steam Summer Sale for 6€, installed it, but didn't try it until yesterday (the same thing I do with most of my Steam games to be honest). The second I clicked ""play"" and realized I was being directed to the EA app, I didn't particularly like it but I didn't think much of it. I started to think much of it when my game turned out be unplayable though.

It just said ""preparing game"" on the EA app for a while and then shut down. No big deal, I'll just close Steam and the EA app and try again. Didn't work. Tried it many times, it just didn't work. I went ahead and restarted my PC, but it also didn't work. I verified integrity of the game files and there was no problem with them. I then tried to launch the game via the EA app, the same ""preparing game"" and shut down combo. Same thing happened when I tried to launch it directly via the Launcher in the game files.

Now it really started to piss me off. I just wanted to play the game I had already paid for, nothing more but also nothing less. I searched online for possible solutions. I deleted the registries of the game in Registry Editor, it didn't work, I used Task Manager to close any EA related app before launching the game, it didn't work. I went as far as installing the discontinued Origin with a patch called Fuck Off EA App (which I totally relate to) because it makes it actually usable and it doesn't force you to install the EA app as it would normally do. Then, I started the game using the Launcher found in the game files and I finally managed to launch it! But after closing the game I couldn't get it to work anymore, it was a one time thing. I was getting mad, it had been an hour and a half up until that point.

I decided to take a look at EA's forums but they didn't help me at all. Since I was already on EA's website though, I thought ""why not use their support page?"". So after some digging I managed to create a case about my problem (they even made it difficult for me to create a case compared to other game companies' support pages I had used in the past), with little faith in them helping me. After a few minutes, a ""specialist"" replied to me in the most generic way possible, even though I had explained what my problem was. I tried to write back to him but my case had been paused for some reason and it didn't allow me to resume it. When I pressed ""resume"" it redirected me to another page, where I received a notification about my current case, and when I clicked on it, it prompted me to resume the case, and it was just an infinite loop. I still haven't figured out what's wrong with the game.

All in all, 6€ isn't going to put a dent in my wallet. But I paid for Mass Effect and I can't even play it. It isn't even my fault, EA doesn't let me play a game on the platform I used to buy it, and instead they make me use their platform that isn't even half good, it's straight up terrible. That is 100% on them. Likewise, their support page is also really not user friendly. I never had problems with EA before, and other games like NFS Heat, which I own Steam, run properly on the EA app. That's why I always doubted the fact that EA sucks. I spent money and several hours of my life trying to figure out the problem they themselves have caused. I apologize for doubting you all.",2024-11-10 15:10:12

gaming,1goo1zx,I need recommendations for a city builder that's not overly complex and easy to enjoy!,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1goo1zx/i_need_recommendations_for_a_city_builder_thats/,120,"Good week everybody!

As the title suggests, I'm not very city builder-savvy, but I've been having an itch lately to play one.

The only colony sim/city builder games that I've ever played were Oxygen not Included, which I played only for 30 hours through the years of having it and basically never got really into it, exactly because of its overly complex nature.

The other one is Against the Storm which I actually played for like 70hrs in the span of two weeks and I loved it (nowhere near finishing the tech tree really) but to be honest it didn't scratch the itch for an actual city builder, the roguelike element is to blame here, although very enjoyable in it's own way. I loved the aesthetic and the ambience/music etc. It's also really hard to get back into after dropping because you'd have to scale it back in difficulty settings and it's kinda demoralising?! I dunno.

So basically what I want from the game is for it to be easy enough to understand in order to have fun without spending 100hours in just to get the jist of it. I want it to have either medieval realistic graphics/settings, or cute graphics, I think I don't care for space/futuristic settings or even present day settings as I find those bring me a ""down"" mood, especially the latter.. I also don't care about the warfare aspect of the games, I actually kind don't wanna have it because I believe it comes hand it hand with the game being very complex.

I think I've boiled it down to these options but I'm having trouble deciding really:

* The wandering village: The cute aesthetic is really winning me here and I think it's a very strong contender, it's still in EA but I think it's pretty much finished.
* Timberborn: Now this one's also cute, I believe it to be a bit more complex so I'm not sure.
* Farthest Frontier: This one is probably the hardest/most complex of the bunch, while also being the most traditional city builder, it's also the most expensive right now and it's not on sale.
* Banished: The fact that it is the oldest one throws me off but It's very traditional and it's like the ancestor of FF, graphics are not that bad so I guess it's okay, it's dirt-cheap and I hear it is not very complex so maybe it could be a good way to ease myself into these games if I'm really interested?!
* Kingdoms and Castles: Very cute graphics, medieval setting, I think it may even be the easiest of the bunch so I'm afraid of it being too shallow and getting bored fast?!
* Settlement Survival: I don't know much about it except that the aesthetic is on the cute side and that it is a decent game.

I would love to have you guys tell me what you think is the best of these choices for me. I'm really having trouble deciding here. I don't wanna buy one of these games and end up playing 5 hours and dropping it because of it's overwhelming complexity, but I also would dislike to get only 20-30 hours out of it.

If I don't answer all the comments, I would like to thank anyone who takes the time to reply to me :D

I read up on 'Cooking Simulator' as someone else had this question for that game, and a dev responded to say the recipes were mostly accurate, but certain measurements, such as time were changed to prevent players from having to sit there for 3 hours monitoring a digital oven.

We got a slew of videos and articles popping up claiming anything open world with guns, cars, and a story was a GTA clone, listing them one by one, as if just to fill a half hour video or a webpage.

Yeah, YouTube and site traffic it all gathered ""may have been"" some ""contributing factor"", granted... /Dr Evil air-quotes.

Regardless, suddenly it seemed there were a ton of games queueing up to be labelled as GTA clones, while trying to hide all their other real credentials behind their backs.

Saints Row, especially the latest one, is great, but it doesn't feel anything like playing GTA. There are bits of it that slightly ""echo"" GTA, mainly the driving which is quality, but it's great in it's own right.

I didn't feel at all like I was playing GTA with Saints Row, unless you only count the GTA ""Strangers and Freaks"" missions, with additional doses of freaky strangeness steroids.

It's more some strange futuristic psychedelia with guns and cars, and I didn't wish I was playing GTA again until the all too short game ended.

I have all of them on one Launcher or another, but the only one I put more than an hour into (completed) was the reboot, as I basically bought them all at the same time and that looked to be the best one.

Just Cause is even less like GTA in every way so not sure how that is even on the list, and I've not played Sleeping Dogs yet, despite owning it, or Total Overdose so can't comment.

Yakuza 0 I have played (completed), and that's another one that is very different from GTA but very fun. It's way more a beat em up than anything else, but it does have progression, and a very Japanese story that doesn't remind me of anything I've ever seen in GTA whatsoever.

Mafia, I don't know if it was trying to be like GTA, but I couldn't get into it as I didn't really enjoy the driving or gunplay as much as GTA over the maybe hour or so total I put into Mafia III.

That's another one I bought the whole series at once and only tried the newest one of it first. Apparently they are good if you stick with them.

The car in Mafia III felt like driving a truck to me, and the combat didn't have the polish or features I hoped for. Was that the one the gun jams constantly by any chance?

I will try III again, but not think of it as a substitute for GTA this time (I definitely bought it hoping it was...), so I will potentially enjoy it more as ""Mafia"" instead of ""So We Herd U Liek GTA"".

I assume it all get's better, but I literally was looking for something more like GTA at the time, ironically it's really just not particularly similar.

Admittedly, and now I think on it more, the main or maybe only reason I picked up most of those titles, WAS because they were on those videos and lists of ""10 GTA Clones TO Play While You Wait!""

The Android games (Gangstar?) that were supposedly GTA like, were so riddled with micro-transactions I just couldn't, but I like China Town Wars some as mobile games go.

I still have not personally found any game out of the ones I tried that really reminded me of any GTA particularly much, so just wondering if anyone thinks similarly or otherwise?",2024-11-11 22:28:46

In this age, its rare to find games that warrants multiple playthroughs, most these days are one playthrough and we move onto the next, Back in PS2, one game that got a shit load of playthroughs to the point i had to buy multiple copies of it, was Mercenaries: Playground Of Destruction.

Personally I think these new fidelity modes that run 30 fps on the PS5 pro will come and bite us all over again, just like they are now with this generation. There's a lack of future proofing for consoles, not even Remasters can save it. That's my biggest criticism, and it's not what I want to see going forward. We're repeating the cycle, and being at the mercy of the devs for a patch Everytime.




Edit: CLARIFICATION.


FUTURE PROOFING GAMES FOR THE NEXT HARDWARE.

If PC's have have the choice to settings, shouldn't that option also come to console? Like eventually? Maybe now! It's a repeating cycle once the PS6 comes out. We bought the PS5 PRO TO get rid of 30 FPS. 


PS5 PRO partially kept that promise, but also introduced more 30 FPS modes. So we're back to where we started. You see how that could be an issue that doesn't go away? ",2024-11-12 15:09:59

I was wondering, how many people from Switzerland there are here and if you know if there is a spot where you can meet and connect with other Gamers. I have discovered the Erupt Lounge in Bern HB and was wondering if anyone has been there before and could tell me what it is like there. Apparently you can Eat, play online and Tabletop games as well.
Thank you for your Time",2024-11-11 05:50:33

I feel like part of it is the predictability factor/lack of originality in gaming.  Just played the first 20 minutes of the Dead Space remake and although I could see the appeal I just didn't feel immersed in the game.  I just sat there thinking ""Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I'll think I'm safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is"".  And this didn't always happen for me.  Historically I've been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show.  I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play.  There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can't count how many games I've installed, played 30 minutes of and then just walked away.  I remember visceral feelings from running through Link To The Past, Gears of War 1 and Arkham Knight.  I miss that.

Anyone else have a similar experience?  Am I chasing the dragon of those old video game highs?

  
edit: thanks everyone. I have really heard the message about looking. I forgot to mention “Slay the Spire” in my list up top. For those who loved that game any other reccomedations would be appreciated. ",2024-11-08 19:23:28

Also generally as a gamer my fav experience is ""Random Surprise Bullshit Go!"".

I feel like Fallout is generally the best implementation of this experience. Some other games implement it to reduce the pain of a badly rolled RNG or just better rolls (like say DRG: Survivor).

I'm looking for more great implementations of luck. Any recommendations?",2024-11-10 04:05:48

I was looking to play it again, but I remembered a bizarre glitch from way back when.

I encountered the glitch twice. I gave a beggar (the term for homeless people in the game) a gold coin for charity. The beggar responded with a ""Thank you, kind lady!"" Then I was locked in the conversation and could not escape, only able to give another coin, followed by them repeating the phrase again. One coin at a time, both beggars took all my gold. 😑

Of course I reloaded the game both times. So... was this ever fixed for PC? Does it still pop up now and then?",2024-11-11 02:29:31
