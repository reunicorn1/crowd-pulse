I ended up in the hospital twice. My advisor and committee have tried to provide me with support and even gave me 2 months off. I've been in serious counseling twice a week. But I suck. I show up late and leave early now. Tasks that used to take me a few hours take a whole day to complete.  I've pulled out of conferences. I'm constantly behind on both my classwork and my research deliverables. For the first time ever I've absolutely bombed exams. I've had a history of depression but it's never gotten in the way of my work. I'm likely going to have to withdraw from one of my courses with a ""w"" this semester. I've become the kind of student that I hate dealing with. 

I know I'm a disappointment to my advisor. We were never super close ( My undergrad advisor was a bit over involved in my life so I made sure to keep clear professional boundaries this time around )

GradSchool,1gq5xf6,"""Technical Levels"" of Professoriate?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gq5xf6/technical_levels_of_professoriate/,1,"Hey Reddit/GradSchool,

Have any of you heard of different ""tiers"" of professor with the same title, distinguished by a number that's private and reminiscent of my career levelling from my time in tech? Do these levels have a meaning for career or pay beyond prestige, since I learned that research professors have to fund their own research and expenses via grant? If so, are they standardized across schools in the US, or regionally by accreditation bodies, or is there a ""somewhat standard"" for them? 

In this example, I was recently offered a (full) research professorship ""rank 5"" ([document describing the levelling](https://file.io/ssVFp0cNWhDD) system from the source attached), which seems pretty high at a top-5-in-all-engineering uni, widely noted (on Google and by ChatGPT; I was unaware they were any good and at first assumed they were not since they reached out to recruit me, and no place decent would ever have me...[talk about imposter syndrome]) as one of the best public unis in the US, so it's not as if they're at a shortage of talent or desparate for candidates to be research professors, which makes it more difficult to believe the Technical Rank has any meaning or reality.

I reached out to the few people I know in academia as faculty and they couldn't answer or answered with ""yeah that's normal negotiate for the highest one you can get"" without being told *what it means*.

Perhaps it's just imposter syndrome because I'm qualified as a ""professor of practice"" as it's called in Europe and honoraries, not based on advanced education but on technical accomplishment in my fields, and it's been a long-term dream of mine to retire even to be an adjunct prof, let alone faculty that can take research assistants and advise theses! (and I'm almost a decade short of the midpoint of the ""normal"" experience requirements: I'm only in my early, or perhaps mid, 30s.)

Perhaps this question should go in another sub; if so? please point me in that direction.",2024-11-13 05:36:19

GradSchool,1gpwo73,Nightmare PIs?  ,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gpwo73/nightmare_pis/,3,"Hey Folks,

I recently had a mid-life crisis (I'm 36) and decided to go back to school to get my PhD after a decade of research in industry.  Everyone in my cohort, including myself, entered the program with their PIs already selected.  I feel like I'm doing well in the program, but I feel like my PI is a megalomaniac.  My GA contract says I'm only required 20 hours per week in agreement for my stipend and I believe it's a hard requirement because it even stipulates deducting any hours over 20 from the following week, but my PI demands that we be in the lab from 8 am to 5 pm.  To be clear, I don't include anything related to the advancement of my PhD as part of my GA contract (school work, studying, my research project)-- that, I believe, is my own responsibility, but those tasks do not always require me to be in the lab.  Additionally, when I first started, because I had a background as a lab manager, I was charged with supervising the lab as my program is within a med school and we have med students, who are interested in research, rotate through the lab.  

After a disagreement which I felt was cordial and respectful, I had all my responsibilities and projects stripped from me.  After the disagreement, but before having my responsibilities stripped-- before I was aware that there was any bad blood, I retrieved my research notebook from their office.  Right after stripping me of my responsibilities, the retrieval of my notebook (which was a normal practice) was made to look like a code of ethics violation to launch a frivolous investigation against me.  Because of the timeline, the committee viewed it as retaliatory on the part of the PI and sided with me, but little is being done to dissuade their behavior.  It's as if the department and program chairs are trying to wag their finger at my PI while also attempting to appease them.  It can't be tenure because the PI is only an associate professor who has been there for 4 years.

To maybe give some insight about the PI, they are younger than I am and have no demonstrated history outside of academia.  They came to this university shortly after achieving their PhD.  They have mentioned that their practices are based on ""what has worked"" for them in the past, but they have yet to graduate a single PhD candidate.  They will be graduating one this year school year, but it will be their first and that student, as I just recently found out, went through many similar situations as me and absolutely hated their time in the program because of the PI.  The PI's only other student besides that one was one who chose to drop out of the program, accepting a masters instead of completing the PhD and that is rumored to be because of the PI as well.

I feel like I'm absolutely killing it in this program.  My grades are good and I feel like I am ahead on my research, but this stress that I'm experiencing is unlike any other.  It feels so unnecessary.  It's as if I wake up wondering if there will be a target on my back every day.  

I can only see this from my perspective.  I'm hoping you can offer me yours'.  Is this normal?  Has anyone been through this?  How did you handle it?  Should I be worried?   ",2024-11-12 21:55:27
GradSchool,1gq254m,Rethinking whether I should do a masters or PhD,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gq254m/rethinking_whether_i_should_do_a_masters_or_phd/,2,"Hi all.

Some context that I think is relevant here:

- I am hoping to do my PhD in comp chem for biochem applications. I don’t have any background in this field, but I do have experience in comp chem for materials (alloys, batteries, etc.). I mainly chose this branch of computational chemistry because I figured a biochem-oriented PhD would put me in a better position for a career in computational chemistry outside of academia. I think I would like researching this topic for 5 years but then again, it’s hard to know for sure.

- I just got rejected from a job with a high salary that I was really hoping to get. This company does research in exactly what I want to do for my PhD. It would’ve meant that I could save some money and learn about this field before jumping into my PhD.

- I am Canadian. I would do a MSc in Canada or a PhD in the US.

- My undergraduate degree was 5 years long because it’s a “co-op” program: it adds a year because it gives us an extra year of work experience 

Now onto my question:

After being rejected, I was beginning to wonder whether I should do a PhD or if I do a MSc. I’m leaning towards a MSc now because
- it would give me direct research experience in the field I’m interested in before I do my PhD 
- I could stay in Canada to do my MSc (which is mostly to avoid the uncertainty of being in the US while Trump is president)
- something I don’t want to admit but it does factor in: it would give me another chance to apply to the company that I got rejected from.

The main reason I’m against doing a MSc is the time lost. Even if I do a MSc, I would still do a PhD after (being a computational chemist in industry requires a PhD in most cases). The masters is just delaying that. My undergraduate degree is already 1 year longer than most, so I feel like a masters would put me behind compared to everyone else.

I’m not sure what to do and I can’t tell if these are valid reasons or if I’m not thinking straight after being rejected. Looking for some advice.",2024-11-13 02:08:44

Well, about a month into the semester, I started having severe depression/anxiety/executive dysfunction to the point where I started needing to miss classes because I wasn’t feeling well enough mentally to leave my apartment or take care of myself. It’s now November, and I think the last time I attended class was mid-October. 

At first I was providing drs notes for my absences but then it became too financially burdensome to go to the doctor every time I was feeling bad, plus a regular doctor can’t do much to help. 

I started really feeling pressure from my professors (two of which are my department chair AND my advisor) to get things turned in. I received a few very snarky emails from a prof in the dept as well as my dept chair. I had been trying to get official accommodations established with the university but due to delays with my doctors office I was unable to get them approved until recently.

Eventually my mental health got so bad that I am no longer taking care of myself. I have 5 bags of trash sitting in my kitchen, I can hardly eat or make myself food (and other times will binge), the thought of going back to classes makes me want to vomit. Not to mention I have made zero progress on my research and still don’t even have a clear topic/research question (I’m on the thesis option track). 

I really regret not dropping/withdrawing from the program while I could (pretty sure the deadline is passed), and I have a meeting with my advisor and department chair tomorrow. I’m worried I’m going to get kicked out of the program. 

If anyone has any advice, insight, words of support or comfort they can give me, please do. 

tl;dr my mental health is shot, I’m likely failing all my classes, and I wish id dropped out sooner",2024-11-12 15:32:36

Hey guys,

I have taken about five to six creative writing courses in Poetry, Fiction, Playwriting, Screenwriting...etc.

However, most of the classes I went in knowing little about writing came out knowing very little as well. As some people have said many classes are, ""peer lead"" these means most of the feedback is from other students, unfortunately most of them don't know much about writing either. 

The Guiding Philosophy of most classes is, ""Self-Expression."" The writing course is form of therapy to share how you feel.This idea means that most of the students write what they want/feel and the instructor tends to give some 'pointers' for improving. However, rarely does the instructors talk about what makes writing good or bad. Even if the instructor might know what makes a good metaphor he  or she won't even say it. And instead, tell the student of sharing their experiences. To me it the concept of craft is there but its not a priority. 

Again, to me this is fine, but there's been many questions that I've had about writing, form, and craft. Which I wanted to understand yet I never got any answers from any of these courses. Hence, I was happy when I discovered the writing better lyrics course. The course approaches creative writing differently.",2024-11-13 03:10:53

It's really discouraging for me. Some of it has been mental health issues and some of it has been rigor. (TLDR how do I cope with dropping courses and graduating late)

My grad school has a rule that more than 2 Cs in consecutive semesters and/or a failing class is grounds for academic remediation (step before probation)

I got 2 consecutive Cs (diff semesters, math classes) AND a failing grade (4 assigments graded type of class and I was deeply depressed and emotional unavailable and didnt do the final 2 assignments of this class)

So, I'm on academic remediation for the fall and retaking the class I failed. I was doing alright this semester but the program is very demanding and I'm falling behind. 

Basically, I'm in an intermediate biostats class with a nitpicky TA. I''m talking not labeling questions is 5 points off, if they ask for a contructed confidence interval but if standard deviation (that they didnt ask for) isnt included its points off. 

Majority of the class is failing, and the professor doesnt really care. They dont give rubrics for assignments and it just overall sucks because I feel like I cant keep up with the pace of the course anyways. So it feels pointless to try which is just making me really depressed and anxious, basically to the point I wont go to class and wont check grades or turn in work. Which I know is silly for a grad student but Im really struggling.

Basically, I would need high Bs or an A on the final exam (I got a 45 on the midterm)...

Anyways I used to be a good student. But now, I'm one of those ""I broke my foot"" ""my boyfriend broke up with me this week"" ""my car broke down and I had to move in with my parents"" so I cant do my work....all of those happened but I know how sucky and fake it sounds. 

I'm in a 2 year program and I'm in my 2nd year nowhere close to graduating. I have a couple of friends in the same position bc of this same course/life. But its so mind wrecking and hard to cope. My family keeps asking when I'll graduate and its really stressful because I have no idea. 

I'm going to drop the class and retake next semester but I feel defeated because I tried really hard. I went to office hours and studied for hours outside of class. I'm not stupid, but I can't keep up with the pace of the class (I am essentially like 2 weeks behind...It just takes me longer to understand). 

Does anyone have any advice or have experience with this? I am trying to be proactive and take responsibility for my courses and grades, but I am so discouraged. I dont really want pity because rigor is expected in grad school...just would like to see other perspectives... TIA.

I attend every lecture and engage while there (ask questions, work in groups, answer problems as best I can), I do all the assignments at least a week or more before the due date to be able to ask for help (frequently), go to TA office hours and tutorials weekly, study with classmates and ask them questions several times a week.

My path is not linear, and I have far more work experience than academic experience at this point in my life. If it’s helpful, i can share a redacted version for critique. 

The other is academic interests, specifically referenced within my personal statement. The prompt directs me to explain my background and academic interests, among other things. Academic interests was not a thing when I applied to undergrad in the dark ages of the early 1990s (or wasn’t in my circles/schools).

I got into a school that was very hard to get into. I'm not saying this to brag but because that's a huge reason why I feel terrible about it. Less than 10 people were accepted out of over 400, including me. When I first started, I was thrilled. However, I experienced something traumatic that has made my memory shot. The degree I wanted to go into essentially requires good memory. On top of that, I don't feel like working where the degree would enable me to work would be safest for me anymore given that those work areas tend to be highly political. People who work in the areas I want to work have left recently because of how little support they have and how political it is (it was like this well before the election, unfortunately it's just getting worse). In addition, I want to leave the states one day and the degree I plan on getting isn't wanted anywhere else. I've been thinking of transferring to social work just because it is transferable and in demand.

I know folks recognize my posts by now so I'm only going to have a semi proper introduction. I'm in my 5th year of my PhD program with an accepted MA in my field from a different program. I've had a LOT of support to get to this point (e.g., life coaches, someone to help with the graduate school application process). My older posts elaborate on this if anyone either to look, although it's not necessary.

Anyway, I've been thinking a lot lately about things and I truly do feel like the critics I've had over the past two or so years were right that I didn't earn my spot in graduate programs (even if the adult autistics sub would find that ableist). Even after my foot got in the door in graduate school, I had a hard time with it and that was represented by the following things:

1.) I had a 3.48 GPA upon graduation from my Master's program with one C+ in a core course (thankfully, it counted). I got that C+ since I was up all night studying and took the final with a dead tooth that I held off on treating until after finals. In hindsight, I should've gone to the dentist and taken an incomplete. I didn't even know incompletes were a thing though.

2.) I relied a LOT on my cohort as far as notes and studying for exams goes. One or two folks in my Master's program would share Powerpoint slides that address the exact content for study guides given for exams (if provided at all) and we would write mock answers that addressed the content on the study guide. It got to the point where faculty in my Master's program were concerned about codependency given that we all had a tendency to write similar answers on the exam to the study guides we shared with each other.

3.) When I decided to take my PhD program's equivalent of stats and cognitive psychology (my subfield), I heavily relied on someone who went straight to PhD in my program (stats mostly, cognitive psychology it was only for a few assignments) to help me out with assignments and whatnot (the one time they didn't help me, I got a low to mid B, idr the exact grade). I was also the one who wrote the post back in October-November 2021 that I used notes during exams taken during my last Master's semester (March 2020 when COVID hit up through next academic year) without accountability and felt guilty (in other words, I used notes when I wasn't allowed at all), which spread like crazy on here. Comments with 150+ upvotes told me not to worry about it, but I feel guilt nonetheless because I feel like I robbed myself. It's worth noting that just about everyone in both cohorts did some varation of studying with others. The biggest thing I did that everyone else openly said they did when we as a cohort met during Zoom meetings was that they also used notes during the exams too, despite the note saying it's closed note closed book. In case anyone's also wondering, lockdown browser wasn't used for those courses at all either. The only accountability was a sentence saying it was closed note closed book. I know everyone else cheated, but I felt like I should've been above that.

I realize this is a vent, but if anyone has insight to share I'd like to hear it for sure.",2024-11-12 15:20:19

I also submitted my final assignments a day late and got this email from my professor. 

“I did not respond at the time, as I was swamped with all the final grading. I did upload your assignments, though, which I’ve never done for anyone before and don’t expect to ever do again. I went the extra mile for you so you could pass the course, but I fear you missed so much of the value of what the course could have been for you. Previous work had been of a much higher standard.
Besides missing taking valuable time to reflect on what you’re learning as you do assignments, you missed all engagement with other students by not reading and replying to the outstanding ideas and examples of applications provided in their posts.
 
I hope you’ll make future courses a priority going forward so that you can get more value from the program.”

Because of this, I was thinking of emailing the team leader of this group to inquire about the possibility of an internship. Is this a good idea? Is there a ""good"" way to write an email like this?

GradSchool,1gob01h,Considerations for a research-based MSc in bio,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gob01h/considerations_for_a_researchbased_msc_in_bio/,2,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I hope this post is allowed but here's my situation: I have a secure offer from 2 labs, both of which offer different experiences, but I am so conflicted on which to choose. I want to make it clear, I'm not looking for anyone to tell me which lab to pick, but I thought I could maybe get some anecdotal experience based on some of the pros and cons I have for each lab, specifically from people who are in or have been through a research-based grad program (this would be for an MSc in bio). 

Lab 1: I did 2 undergrad projects in this lab, and I really enjoyed it. It's more benchwork and working with live animals. It is a more niche lab with less funding, but the PI is experienced.

Lab 2: This is a new lab in a bigger city and bigger institution. The work would involve a lot more bioinformatics than I have experience with, but I know my PI is eager to teach me. Since the lab is new, they have more funding, but I also don't know what life as a grad student would involve since it's a new university, etc.

Here are some of the main differences between the two labs:

* **Experience with the PI:** I have done 2 undergrad projects in Lab 1, so I have an established relationship with the PI. I have always loved how close knit he is with his grad students, and I really like how he runs his lab. Lab 2 would be a new experience - I've toured the lab and it seems really nice, but it seems a lot more impersonal and I couldn't really gauge the kind of relationship he has with his students.
* **Project:** Considering the previous work I've done in Lab 1, I know I'll enjoy my project there. The PI and I discussed some of the projects he has in the works and they are definitely up my alley. I would be more likely to pursue a PhD in this lab, which would be more in line with my future goals. Lab 2 however can help me expand some of my skills, particularly in bioinformatics. It would also give me a chance to branch out in my field to see if there may be more interesting projects out there, though I do think this lab would be a stepping stone to something in the future.
* **Industry Potential:** I know that industry positions in biosci can be hard to come by, which is why I want to build the best resume possible should I want to enter into it. Lab 1 would give me more experience with animal handling, bench work procedures. Lab 2 would give me more bioinformatics experience, and is located in a big city on the west coast, which has more biotech jobs available.

Like I said, if there is anything that I mentioned above that you, or someone you know, has experience dealing with, I'd love to know. I don't know many science grad students (at least not ones that are doing a masters for the science and not to boost their med school applications). I would love to hear your personal experience of what grad school is like and what you think are important considerations for future students.  ",2024-11-10 21:09:24

The TA let me know that she had not recieved my assignment which was due at midnight last night. The assignment was just a 200-word summary of that week’s reading, nothing major, but altogether these assignments are worth 20% of my grade and there is a zero tolerance policy for late submissions.

My heart sunk, and my mind flashed back to last night when I had to attend an important event for my job and had a complete lapse in memory - never handing in the summary.

I swore a few times, face palmed myself, and took a deep breath. I thought for a minute, but ultimately just decided to be completely honest with the TA about what happened. I explained that I had been distracted by another event (she knows what I do for work), and just honestly forgot to submit the assignment. I told her that I would accept the late penalty with no question, but would also be happy to hand in the assignment late for even partial marks. I was expecting to just have to swallow the penalty.

She replied to me right away: “No problem! Life happens. If you’re able to hand in the summary before Monday, we will not apply the late penalty.""

I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked her earnestly for her understanding. I understand that this TA is probably more laid back than most, and I know this isn’t a foolproof formula, but I thought this could be a valuable reminder to myself and  any other new grad students this fall about the value of integrity in these situations.

I find those to be the loneliest. I can always get myself to work or make plans with people or just catch up on chores over the weekend. But Friday evenings leave me in a weird limbo.

I am currently overseas in a MA program that is facilitated by a US institution of higher education and to put it bluntly... it isn't what I signed up for. I was prepared to enter a critical space that was academically rigorous but it hasn't been and a lot of that has to do with my cohort.

Every. Single. Week. We talk about issues in international education (the focus of our MA program) and my peers have somehow made it this far without the self-awareness to acknowledge or even recognize that THEY ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WRONG. Traveling every weekend, unabashedly being tourists, avoiding meaningful engagement with the local community...

They fail to grasp simple concepts in class and none of them have the basic experiences I expected them to have out of their undergraduate careers. One of my peers espouses misogynistic rhetoric and does not have the wherewithal to recognize it, nor the drive to actually question and change their behavior when it is pointed out. I feel like every other day is an episode out of The Office, and I'm Jim just looking straight into the camera with that look that says, ""Are you getting this? Is this actually happening?"" I mean, there are times when I am literally sitting in class, waiting for my professor to give me a subtle head nod, before jumping into a conversation and *explaining* a topic to my peers or answering a question that no one else can, simply because they didn’t review the assigned readings.

I’m almost certain that one of my peers is using ChatGPT to do their work, judging by the clear inconsistencies in their written assignments. They also proudly talked about using random excerpts from academic articles for a recent assignment we had, completely missing how the point of the assignment was to thoroughly review relevant literature.

I feel, more often than not, that I am back in high school; my peers have labeled me as ""the smart one"" and ""the overachiever"" when I am literally just doing the work. On top of that, I overworked myself in order to afford being here, yet my peers are being sponsored by their parents and treat this program as a vacation. Worse is that they have an expectation of a degree at the end of the program, regardless of their effort, and I am almost convinced that the school we attend is under pressure to pass everyone even if they only put in a minimal effort.

I feel so tense all the time, and things really piqued for me a few days ago when I openly maligned political apathy in class and my peers felt obligated to give poor excuses as to why they didn't vote in the US presidential elections before imploring that we just ""move on"" from the topic of the presidency.

  
**What's Next?**

I feel like the obvious answer to this dilemma is to double down on my independent research, utilize my relationships with my professors for personal and professional growth, and continue networking outside of the classroom.

I should mind my own business and let my peers determine what they are going to get out of this program. It's just so difficult for me to let it go because this MA program was sold as a *cohort*\-based program so when my peers are unequipped for class or shallowly interact with guest lecturers or community partners, it directly impacts me.

I've spoken with my professors about the varying levels of commitment and preparedness in my cohort, and I think I should arrange another conversation, but I don't even know what to say at this point because they are already well aware of the in-class dynamics.

Do I directly address these issues with my peers? The biggest issue I have with doing that is the small size of my cohort, and I don't think that bringing up these issues would have the intended effect; it would probably serve to alienate me. Is this a common reality at the master’s level that I should’ve expected? I honestly thought that by this point students would be more committed, driven, and ready to engage at a deeper level.

What do I do?

I am currently a senior at Washington University in St. Louis majoring in Psychology-Neuroscience-Philosophy, minoring in WGSS (Women, gender, and sexuality studies). 

I primarily want to work with teens from marginalized groups in individual therapy, but will likely take on clients from other demographics as well. 

I am planning on using a letter of recommendation from a psychology research lab I worked at for 2 semesters, but beyond that, I have questions about the 2-3 others I am currently planning on asking. 

My closest relationship with a professor has been one of my WGSS professors, who would be willing to write me a letter. However, I was talking with my mom and she said this might not be the best idea because this professor cannot speak to my aptitude in psychology. However, she can speak to my understanding of social issues, communication skills, grasp of theory, and more as I have taken 3 of her classes. Would this be a strong person to ask for a letter of recommendation? 

Another professor I am considering asking is a professor I have for 2 classes this semester. My only concern is one of the classes I am more engaged in than the other, as the content interests me a lot more. I am still doing well in the other class, but he has given me a lot more praise for my papers and projects in the class I am more interested in. The class I am more interested in is more psychology and cognitive science focused than the other class, which is more philosophy focused. Would this professor still be a good choice to ask?

Lastly, I am wondering if it would be a good idea to ask my boss at my service industry job I've been working at for 2 years for a letter? I realize it's pretty unconventional, but I've gotten consistently good performance reviews from him and I do know him on a personal level. I believe he could also speak to my ability to be professional and provide a good experience to people from various walks of life as my job is in a very socioeconomically diverse area.

I like diving into the research papers, thinking deeply about concepts, writing on the subject, and engaging in discussions with my research peers.

However, I’ve realized that I’m less enthusiastic about the hands-on aspects of research. The practical lab work, from performing routine methods to setting up and maintaining experiments, isn't where my strengths or interests lie. Unfortunately, the hands-on work seems to make up about 80% of the research process.

Is this something others can relate to, and if so, how do they manage it? Given my preferences, would an academic career be a good fit, or will it likely continue to involve a heavy focus on lab work (e.g., as a postdoc and eventually as an assistant professor)?",2024-11-09 05:38:48

Hello! 
I’m not from America so I’m trying to figure all this health insurance stuff out. I’m only applying to programs that offer to cover most or all of my health insurance. 

I take medication for adhd (concerta). I’m a bit confused about how common it is to have your meds covered by graduate student insurance. These are huge health insurance companies, so I just kind of assumed they would cover basically every “popular” medication (of which concerta is one). But it seems I could be wrong about this? Whenever I look up health insurance plans, I can’t find anything about what specific meds are covered. 

So my question is this: is it typical to have meds like this covered.m by graduate student health insurance? If your meds aren’t covered in the USA, what do you do? ",2024-11-09 03:14:21

My freshman and senior year (so far) I knocked out of the park grades-wise, but my sophomore and junior year, I didn’t do so hot, as I encountered some major mental health and personal/family issues. That is why my GPA isn’t much higher. Also, I have been online since 2020 due to it being easier to balance school and work full time.

But I do have a 98% in her class and she has given me excellent feedback for my hard work this semester. 
Grades wise, I know I could be doing better, but the requirements for the program state that I need a minimum of a 2.5 GPA to be accepted, so I feel like I may be in the clear.

I am pretty good at presenting so I am not too worried about that. My biggest concern is that this feeling of ""I don't know anything"". I spoke with my supervisor recently on how I should be going about preparing for my defense, he gave me good advice as knowing my thesis inside and out. But again I just feel like I have a very basic understanding of my project and I am not really sure how to have a deeper understanding to critically think. 

I guess my question is, how do I go about trying to a have deeper understanding of my project and everything that encompasses it. How do I go about trying to know everything there is to know about my project? The only thing that I can think about it reading more paper?

Hope you are well. I require some guidance regarding Higher Education. 

I graduated from BBA in Finance with a CGPA of 3.86 from a developing country in South-Asia. Now I want to go for higher studies (preferably Masters) in USA.

Since I am not financially sound for funding my Masters, I need scholarships. 

From what I researched, Economics and Data Science/Business Analytics, they require certain prerequisite courses and/or people from Maths/Stat/Engg/Economics background. I have emailed the Grad Coordinator of several universities to know if there is any flexibility regarding this curricular requirements but have not gotten any reply.

So, my question is.
1) From your experience, which subject from the three I mentioned should I try for if I need to get Funding/Assistantship? How do I go about it? I intend to get a high score in GRE. Other than that.

2) Is there any dos/don'ts while emailing grad coordinator? I wonder why I did not get replies.

3) From your experience, is the curricular requirements rigid or flexible for International Students? 
Would doing a Masters in Economics inside my country give me a better edge at getting admission and funding in USA? (The Masters inside my country will atleast take 2 years)

I hope that in future other reagents will be widely available but I’m not educated in the current uses of FBS and why that one is used. 

Hello, I am a biology undergrad thinking about PhD programs. However, I do not want to do animal work as I am an ethical vegan. I'm worried that there is no path for me in biology, even though I'm passionate about the field and it's too late to change my undergrad major.

2) Northern Illinois University PhD. Not accepted yet, waiting to hear back. I have a MUCH higher chance of getting accepted here. Research areas i am interested in at Fermilab. However not ranked nearly as high as NU.

3) NIU masters. Already accepted. This route, I would work on the masters and wait a little bit longer to apply to multiple PhD programs at highly regarded schools.

I’m in my doctoral program, and I recently discovered ChatGPT. I have heard my professors describe it as a “tool when used properly”, so I wrote a paper and used ChatGPT to make it more professional sounding. I could still tell you everything that was in it, and I still feel like it’s my own thoughts, but I used the program to polish my writing. Some of it didn’t feel right, so I’d go back and tweak it to my liking. 

Anyway, I submitted it last week, and today I found out about Quillbot for the first time. Out of curiosity, I used the AI detection with my paper, and it flagged huge portions of my paper for AI. 
What is interesting is that I know some of those sections were things I added in myself, not AI. 

Furthermore, upon reading a little bit deeper into my university’s academic integrity policy, AI can be used to help search things, but shouldn’t be used to improve writing. It should also be cited, which I didn’t do. 

Am I screwed? Also I disagree with parts of this policy! I feel like seeing different ways to phrase things or vocabulary terms I may not have originally picked does improve my writing. 

I’m still proud of my paper. I spent a whole weekend on it and worked really hard. If I had known it may flag for cheating I wouldn’t have used ChatGPT at all.

This is my first term as a PhD student. I'm a GRA and not teaching this term. I am also my PIs only grad student. My PI has gone out of their way for me a lot and is incredibly supportive and hard working. They are in the lab consistently doing their own experiments, as well as training undergrads and myself. They recently started teaching courses on top of it all so they're under a lot of pressure right now. I even talked to them about the strike and how they'd feel and they gave me a ""do what you feel is right"" kinda chat. I sensed no animosity should I choose to actively strike.

However, I feel like going on strike and withholding my labour would be a huge kick in the groin to them for everything they've done for me. I believe our student body is getting shafted by the Uni for sure, but my advisor has nothing to do with that. 

I feel like withholding my labour as a PhD student is also a bit of a disservice myself. I could have stayed in industry and made 3x what I'm making right now but I made the choice to go back to school despite the financial risk. I'm actively losing money/savings to learn how to be a better scientist. My stipend is generally better than what other departments get, so while I do feel heavily for those in other positions and their financial troubles, I have a hard time rationalizing why I'd hurt myself and my research over this.

I pay member dues to the union and support how I can. I don't want to be a ""scab"" but I also don't want to ruin the momentum I have in my research towards my thesis. Things are going well for me and I do this bc it's fun. I have a sad and lonely personal life so work makes me forget about that. I'm not too sure what to do and I worry I'll isolate myself socially even more if I ""cross the line"".


EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, suggestions, and thoughts! I've talked to other union members and have decided I'll find creative ways to support the strike. Ultimately this won't change my current workload, except maybe my work hours (i want to be ""invisible"" in a sense) - as well as use this time to catch up on literature in my field which I can do away from the lab.

My program has two tracks, Professional Science or Thesis/Research, and I have chosen the thesis track.

However. I have no idea what I'm doing- regarding formalities like reports, manuscripts, and, most urgently, my thesis proposal.

I have to submit a thesis proposal in the spring to the department. Two of my committee members have advised me to do a literature review. I get, abstractly, that this means to see what research has already been done, but I'm confused about if I need to be typing something up. I've seen lit reviews as full published papers that reviewed hundreds of articles. My topic is kind of niche so there's not a ton that specifically relates from my searches so far; I can branch out to related research to add more, but there's no way I'm getting hundreds.

I just finished my thesis today, and I feel like it has zero purpose, I'm feeling like I just written a huge pile of shit that will probably be forgotten and lost. Yet it took immense time and effort from my side in order to perfect. I even started questioning the main research question itself, and then I came to the conclusion that it's essentially worthless. I've always thought a dissertation and a MSc thesis is supposed to contribute to Humanity, add something of value, something new... But now? I feel like if anything, I'm a disgrace to humanity.

GradSchool,1gl3r2i,Should I Pursue Another Undergrad in CS/Math or Finish My MD and Go Straight to a Biotech PhD?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gl3r2i/should_i_pursue_another_undergrad_in_csmath_or/,7,"I'm 26  with a B.Med.Sc. and currently halfway through my MD program, which I could finish in about 3 years. However, I’ve realized that I’m not interested in clinical medicine or treating patients in a hospital or community setting. Instead, I’m far more drawn to biotech, applying exact sciences to medicine and biology, and entrepreneurship in this space.

I'm conflicted between two paths:

1. **Pursue Another Undergrad in CS, Math, or Statistics (Fast-Track):** This would allow me to build a strong foundation in computational skills, algorithms, and quantitative thinking, which are crucial in the biotech fields I’m interested in. It would extend my timeline a bit, but I wonder if it might make me more prepared for a computational PhD later on.
2. **Finish My MD and Go Directly Into a PhD Program in Biotech or Computational Biology:** With my MD, I could apply for a PhD in a relevant field without an additional undergrad. This option would save time, but I’m concerned that I might lack some of the deeper computational or mathematical skills I’d gain in a dedicated program.

Has anyone been in a similar position, or does anyone have advice on which path might be better suited for a career in biotech/entrepreneurship? I’d really appreciate honest insights on the long-term impact of each route. Thanks!",2024-11-06 17:21:37

The campus is beautiful, the weather is rainy just the way I like, the surrounding area is beautiful too. I also got a nifty fellowship for being the program's top applicant, which is amazing and for which I am so, so grateful. But it's *incredibly rural*. I mean, the entire county and all its towns has roughly the same population as just my hometown. There was always so much to do at home, and I had my pets, my family, my frequent haunts, and a person I was interested in but couldn't keep seeing because I knew I had to move. For the most part, I was pretty happy there. Here? I keep doing as much social stuff as I can but there's just the same group of people again and again and again. There's not much to do unless I want to drive the 2 hours or so to the big metro area, there's absolutely no dating prospects (every app just said ""you're out of users in your area""), and everything worth doing seems to be a 2+ hour drive away. It's affecting my school performance, because I'm just kind of miserable. I am NOT a small town girl at all, and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to while living here except eventually moving away. 

  
I think I chose wrong. I got into two really great programs super close to home, and while the funding offers weren't as good (not like *this* one is good; I'll have to take out loans next year when I'm not on fellowship to afford rent), I knew I would have been happy there. Like, this is objectively a better program that I'm in, but I've had to ask for extensions for every single assignment because the depression of being so isolated has been that hard to push through. 

  
Part of me is wondering if I should even stick it out with this program at all. It's not directly related to my future career (teaching high school); I'd just make more money with a MA than I would a BA, and the MA in my subject would waive my California testing requirements for licensure. I feel no motivation to work on my thesis or do anything here, and that's not at all the work ethic I had on even my worst days at Berkeley. I don't know why I'm here if I hate it so much, you know?

I had other rotations to complete and when I was finished I went back to his lab to ask about officially joining. However, he suddenly decided that he is considering retiring now and doesn't know if he wants to take on another 5 year commitment. 

I am absolutely bewildered and blindsided by this, since we had agreed I would join his lab during my rotation with him. He was the main reason I decided to come to this school and while I had other professors I was interested in they were either not a good fit or had limited funding.

I thought it would be more practical and focused on mediation, diplomacy, and negotiation skills. But the program is set up for people who want to STAY in academia. I explicitly do not want that. 

Anyway, I have tried using ChatGPT to help me come up with topics that combine my love of film, art, technology and interculturality. But the ideas just do not seem that interesting. And due to not caring that much about the program I just cannot ""see"" the potential areas of research in anything I am studying.

GradSchool,1gjsee9,Coming Back at 30,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gjsee9/coming_back_at_30/,5,"I was wondering if I could get some perspective on this.  I graduated with a BSME back in 2016 and have been working full time since.  Increasingly, I have been thinking of going back to get a masters, possibly with employer help, though I would be willing to go on my own if the university offered a tuition waiver and stipend (I believe that is considered a fellowship).

I was wondering if anyone had any perspective or experience with this.  In many respects, I feel I would perform better now versus undergrad.  I've got a lot more money to have a more comfortable life, and I feel less that everything is riding on this.  If the worst happens and I withdraw, it's not like I can't go back to a similar job I am working now.  Not to mention, my mental health is much better after a medication change, therapy, etc.  Also not having my hormones causing me to mentally swing all over the place is a nice feeling too.

But of course I have some concerns as well.  Probably the biggest worry is about having to relearn things that I'm not realistically going to have remembered from my time in undergrad.  I'm a bit worried about the fact that I am probably going to be older that most if not all of my cohort.  Not by much, and I've never looked down on someone coming back to school later, but I still have a bit of that in the back of my mind.  ",2024-11-04 23:19:24

I have   ADHD (medicated) and mild dyslexia, and I'm finding it really, really difficult to get through academic papers without losing focus, even for topics I am genuinely interested in. It's harder still to actually pick anything up from the papers- I read the words on the page and I understand them, but nothing stays in my mind, so I have to take really extensive notes in order to get anything at all out of my readings. It takes me well over an hour, sometimes more than two hours, to get through an average 12-16 page paper, and I feel like that's just not a sustainable pace to work at. In undergrad I could usually get by just skipping to the discussion and reading that, or by scanning the paper to find the info I needed. I know as a grad student I actually need to read for understanding in order to create a foundation of knowledge for myself, and I feel like I'm just hitting a wall. Does anyone have any advice for this? Am I just not cut out for academia?

Sometimes he will demand data we've never talked about before, and when I suggest that I will add that experiment to my to-do list he just asks me repeatedly why I don't have it.

Problem is, my PHD does rotations and we are expected to choose a lab in April. Candidacy prep starts in fall, the last semester I plan to be here.

TLDR : If I get into a graduate school, but they ask for my final transcripts (that might contain a couple of C’s or a C and a D because of this semester, which isn’t part of my initial application), would my admission be revoked? 

So I’m at the point of applying to grad school and I think I have a decent profile. I’m applying to only MS programs. I have a 3.5 GPA and I’m planning on pursuing a masters in the same field(electrical engineering) 

My academic journey basically started with me getting a good GPA freshman year, but sophomore year was really bad (like 2.75 avg GPA for the year, including 2 C’s). After that, I joined research and really worked hard junior year, pursuing two majors and trying to do good in all my classes. I basically just ended up with a healthy mix of A’s and B’s, but all A’s in my proposed research area courses (which is like two courses lol)

I’m applying with a good profile I think, but this semester is truly just too brutal for me. One elective class is hard to get motivation for but I think it should definitely stay above a C. However, I’m in this other class where the professor is the worst I’ve ever had. Like nobody knows whats going on and they are really fine with failing like half of us. I actually might get a C or even a D or even an F and have to retake the course.

This class isn’t related to what I want to research, but I’m afraid that getting bad grades might look bad. My junior year grades might get me into grad school but my senior year grades have to be submitted afterwards for the schools I’d love to go to. Like is there a chance that they revoke an admission because my grades aren’t good senior year when I submit my final transcript?

""Throughout the last eight years of my life, whether it was during high school or undergrad, I worked harder than I thought was humanly possible in pursuit of one goal; obtain my Psy.D. and make my mark on the field of psychology. Despite a challenging battle with my mental health, I persevered and reached remission so that I could achieve my lifelong goal of changing the way mental healthcare is given and received. Today, neither my life nor my education are affected by my struggles. Throughout the years, I encountered many practitioners who treated mental health with a “one-size-fits-all” approach rather than employing empathy for my unique situation. As a result of these experiences, I vowed to treat my future patients with unmatched empathy, compassion, and most importantly, without judgment. I firmly believe that mental health is not a “one-size-fits-all” field, but rather requires uniquely tailored treatment plans, compassion, and unwavering patience in order to find the most effective treatment for your patients. I do not believe in entering this field because you want to “help people”, I believe you enter this field to change lives and treat your patients as you would want to be treated, regardless of how challenging the case is"".",2024-11-04 14:37:04

This is a situation I have been thinking about for awhile.

The standard answer is, ""Well its 2 years masters and 3 years of a graduate thesis.""

Which would be the equivalent of a 2 years masters degree in europe/uk and a 3 year thesis project. 

That's what some people online want you to believe. Including a few Europeans who say that the European phd is the same as the American one.

However, to me this couldn't be far from the truth. 

In fact, almost everything about this is not true.

First, I would say for many field 50% of students already have a Masters Degree before applying to their phd's. Since its very competitive to get in. In fact some Masters programs tout themselves as, ""Join our department and we'll get you into a phd program. Usually these students do a 2 years masters degree plus a 1 year of graduate thesis."" To be as competitive as the excellent students who went straight from their BA to Phd. 

Its only the most brilliant students the one's that go directly from a BA to a Phd and get their masters en route. In fact, based on my research its usually the one's who end up being College Professors the one's who did that whole ""standard path."" 

Despite this fact I would say the majority, inclusing the best students, do it in 7 years. 2 years masters to and 5 years do do their book length graduade thesis. To me this is where things get nebulous, it shouldn't take them so long to write a thesis. That's 2 more years than if you were doing separate in Europe/UK. Also its actually more common for half the students to take 7 years then the other half to take more.

There's a lot of mystery as to what happens. Also the same happens with post-doc fellows where unless they are brilliant they end up being visiting fellows for awhile. ",2024-11-04 07:43:55

I love my life in this city, I love my friends, I love my on-campus fellowship and my cohort of fellow fellows, and I genuinely like research. But I shouldn't be in an area studies program; I need to be in anthropology or geography as there are too many constraints in my current program. The problem is, my school doesn't have a geography department, and the anthropology professor I'd work with isn't taking applicants for another year as he has too many students. 

Also, to complicate matters; he doesn't know it, but I've lost all trust in my advisor after he made an inappropriate comment about sexually assaulted last semester. I cannot shake what he said and I can't find the words to bring this up to him. On top of this, he's approaching retirement and I feel like he's getting increasingly hard to connect with, and he's struggling to keep on top of things. I can't open up to him and I'm scared he's going to judge me if I express these thoughts. I think he knows that something is going on because he kind of apologized for being a bad supervisor in a roundabout way, and mentioned that he's worried he's holding me back from exciting research that I'd like to do. I'm speaking to student support and our department administrator, but basically, my options are:

1. Carry on and write a thesis I don't want to write

2. Leave (I absolutely do not want to do this)

3. Try to transfer to another program (unlikely)

4. Create a 'custom' PhD program (possible but I'd need a heck of a lot of faculty support, and try to figure things out that way

5. Another option? I'm really not sure what other options there'd be

If I won't really gain any skills (besides some basic knowledge while reading papers in the first few years) and I don't have a good motivation for joining the lab, should I include this position on my grad school application?

I'm interested in an interdisciplinary program with emphasis on anglo literature and culture, with a strong theoretical foundation. I'm interested in media and cultural production, literary theory and history, literature as an object of critique. basically i'd like something interdisciplinary with the opportunity to read philosophy and theory and the chance to write a strong thesis at the end of the program. interested in 19th and 20th century American literature and speculative fiction.

  
I'm certainly curious about program recs, but I'm more so wondering if anyone has any wisdom regarding the role of the thesis in a program vs. a course of study that's plainly advertised as critically engaged and theoretically driven i.e. berkeley, the new school, etc – which are regrettably beyond my ability and interest to pay for. post-MA goals might include an American PhD however 

  
and indeed, this post is a bit vague - but I'm really curious about general trends in literature programs. and anyone's experience.

So basically I am trying to get suggestions/advice from mostly post-docs right now on some programming background necessary to apply for a PhD in cosmology. 

The specific subfield that I am interested in requires an extensive use of Python in writing and managing large codes. The projects that I have worked on, for almost a year and a half, were comfortably done in Mathematica and were mostly theoretical with little to do in terms of using datasets or running complicated codes. 

Now I am worried that due to my lack of experience in this matter, I would find it difficult to convince any potential advisor in the future. From my end, I have been working on my Python again for a while now and learning some specific tools. I thought that if I were to contact somebody who is an expert in my interested field, then maybe he/she can provide me with some sort of advice on what more I can do to tacke this issue of improving the essential programming tools. I do have contacted a few people on this subject and none of them have replied even when I wrote them a follow-up email after a couple of days. 

Should I even ask such a question to these experts? I have followed a pattern in my emails where, after I introduce myself, I talk about my past background and then ask my present question stating that I need their advice. Should I change this approach and ask my question in a different manner? I don't want to ruin my chances with other experts by repeating the same mistake that I am making up to now. 

Please, any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Im actually a 4th year undergrad who’s applying to grad school but thought this sub is the best to vent.

Now that I have started the grad applications process, I feel myself constantly anxious of not having something substantive to say in interviews. My research experience in the last year dealt with me learning a new model or technique, mastering and coding it, and then a week later thinking it’s garbage as it’s so intellectually easy - which is when I’ll try to figure out another complex model, and the cycle repeats.

I have noticed my research can be comparable to the standard of a lot of decent papers published but for some reason I never feel it’s substantive. I can never explain my research without making it seem like I’m explaining the absolute basics.

Has anyone had a similar feeling? How do you overcome it?",2024-11-01 20:54:43

The trouble is, I'm already a junior and, I didn't realize this was what I wanted to do till over this past summer. For a variety of reasons, I've not been as diligent as I should've been about networking with profs and I'm starting to feel like it's going to screw me over. 

To build up my application for grad school, I want to do my major's honors program, which consists of taking a senior seminar where you work all year on a thesis project at a grad school level and format. I know which professor I'd like to advise my project, but he takes a heavy teaching load every semester and I don't know if he'd even have the time for it. The trouble is, I literally have no idea who else I could go to. I've taken classes for my major with a total of 5 profs, and 3 of them I basically never spoke to, since the classes were huge. I also need a secondary advisor, and, if I'm admitted to the program, then I need to find a third professor from *outside* the department, too. So, if even one person says no to me, I'm stuck.

I'm very passionate about my research topic, but the social aspect of getting into the program is already overwhelming for me. I have to submit my proposal in the first month of next semester, so I'm feeling like there's very limited time to connect with any more profs. Is there another way I can reach out to faculty in my department, even if I'm not in their class?

I’m in my senior/final year of an Economics and Management degree at a top 3 uni in the UK (an equivalent to harvard/yale/MIT). I was originally going to try and get a graduate job in banking immediately after uni but have been rejected from everything (50+ roles) so want to try something new. 

I’ve always wanted to work in international development / somehow be involved in the improvement of infrastructure, education, health etc in developing countries.

I also can’t tell where to go for a masters because I’m worried that going to a “less prestigious” uni after my undergrad would look weird

Or should I be looking for an internship with an international agency? Or keep applying? I feel really lost right now.

Anyway, I'm posting now (after my latest controversy) to get myself on track. I have the following responsibilities and I really don't know how to prioritize them at the moment given when I want to graduate:



1.) My dissertation. This one's fairly obvious.



2.) My fellowship demands for this year that I only learned about this past week. I have four mandatory events I need to attend to stay active in the state's system that keeps track of fellows. The good news is that working as a full time visiting instructor last year gave me the service credit I needed in this case.



These events are: a.) A colloquily in December (15 minute presentation on my dissertation topic. Not worried personally).



b.) A symposium in February (my fellowship coordination would like me to make a submission)



c.) A gala in April (a celebration of us, as my coordinator worded it, not worried about this one)



d.) A national level DEI conference in May (state that gave me my fellowship will pay for it. Fellowship coordinator also suggested a submission for it too)



3.) Two (or possibly more) manuscripts that I'm working on with my previous summer internship boss.



I recently told them about the fellowship requirements in a meeting I had with them earlier this afternoon to let them know I can still be involved, just less so than before.



4.) Working with state vocational rehabilitation to find a job post graduation. I know a lot of folks in academic circles point out they may not be able to help due to my level of education (Master's in Experimental Psychology earned), but my home state's vocational rehabilitation has a ""back door"" to state level jobs I could work. I should note that I am aware of a specific class of jobs I could qualify for (research specialist) as I recently applied for one those positions (wasn't hired sadly), but I was only one of three who passed the competency test.



How should I prioritize each of my responsibilities?



Those who've kept up with me for a long time likely know I have extreme attention and fatigue issues, but those have been getting better as I've been on my Ketamine infusion regimen all throughout October.

GradSchool,1ggre90,Need a Brand New Masters…,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ggre90/need_a_brand_new_masters/,8,"Hi there, I’m newer to this sub and looking for support or ideas around my Illinois counselor licensure roadblocks. 

I graduated from a masters program in Minnesota in 2009. I am from Illinois and when I returned, I found out that my masters program did not meet Illinois requirements for licensure. So while I had a masters degree in addiction counseling, I could not actually become licensed as a clinician in the state of Illinois.

I was in my mid 20s and I figured whatever I am just gonna work with addiction services for the rest of my life anyway so I Will just get a CADC (Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor) in Illinois for now. 

Fast-forward to know, I’ve been in the field for 10 of my 15 professional working years. I’ve been working with the foster care system for the last five years and oh my gosh do I need to get licensed. I applied for a licensure with the Illinois Department of financial and professional regulation it was told that my application was pending proof of completing a qualified masters program. Here’s what I was told is missing: 

They require 48 credit hours and my program is 46, they require a two year program and mine was 12 straight months, they require competencies in 13 core areas and I was only trained in 11 and some of those are even missing full credits in those areas. 

The grad school I previously attended, will not offer multiple degrees so is not able to take my credits to turn it into anything else. They suggested I look into an EdS degree?

I was accepted to a local program, however, they also will not take any of my credits due to the fact that my masters program was not CACREP accredited at the time of my attendance. 

So I’m gonna go get a masters degree. And I’m gonna have to go part-time because I work full-time. And it’s gonna take me four years to go part-time, and then another full year of clinical experience but will be required after that. It’s devastating and I want to share my story. Thank you in advance for the part of you that can hold compassion for a 22 year-old me not knowing what questions to ask or doing the research to find out. ",2024-10-31 22:55:02
GradSchool,1ggqbyn,What is the pathway to a PhD for undergraduate students who lack opportunities? ,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ggqbyn/what_is_the_pathway_to_a_phd_for_undergraduate/,4,"Currently a junior at a university known for its engineering, computer science and medicine program. I transferred from a CC when I was majoring in the humanities and upon transferring, switched to an Environmental Science B.S. I need to caveat the rest of this by stating I was not heavily engaged with academics or any sort of future planning, prior to transferring, with this lack of foresight and responsibility resulting in me transferring to the 'wrong' school. 

I want to pursue a PhD in Atmospheric Science, with the intent of becoming a climate scientist. The school I go to does not offer an atmospheric science or meteorology program, which, had I done an iota of research, I'd have known but I cannot change the past, so here I am. To supplement the lack of mathematics and programming courses within my degree, I plan on completing several of the Physics/Calculus pre-reqs I'll need for grad school, while learning Python as I work through the B.S. 

The lack of research opportunities, rather than coursework is really where my worries lie. I've created a list of 10 programs, so far, that I'm highly interested in, each featuring professors, admissions requirements, program details etc. None of the programs require undergraduate research as an admission requirement but I think it'd be foolish to assume *some* research experience was not expected prior to admission into a PhD program. I've struggled on 2 parts; The physics/computer science department is *heavily* focused on military, photonics, & other unrelated (to climate science) fields/applications. The biology/chemistry departments also lack overlapping research interests. I've spoken to one of my professors about potential geospatial/climate related research and was told to reach out again during the Spring semester, and while I do plan on doing so, I won't hold out on it leading to actual research. 

I've also applied to as many REU's, scholarships, and non-profit, atmospheric science opportunities as I can with no success. I will continue to apply but I don't think much will change unless someone happens to take a chance on me. With that being said, this leads me to wondering what avenues I can take to actually become a potential candidate for graduate programs? Atmospheric Science differs from other fields in the sense that it is very challenging to actually join a *lab,* and gain research experience during a gap year, in the way one would do as a biology or chemistry student. 

From everything I've read, especially on here, applying to a PhD without research experience is not perceived as a positive, from the perspective of the admissions committee, but from where I stand, I'm not sure what I can do. Has anyone been in a similar position and found an avenue? ",2024-10-31 22:03:06

GradSchool,1gg74n9,Saving money as a grad school student (tips and tricks) ,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gg74n9/saving_money_as_a_grad_school_student_tips_and/,13,"Hello all, 

This is a topically relevant topic and something we are all curious about - how to cut expenses and save up during graduate school. As an international PhD student in the US, here are some tips and tricks I use to ensure that I can make ends meet while also maximizing my savings. 

  
Notes to keep in mind: 

\- I do not own a car but use local commute (buses) every time.  

\- I live in an area with comparatively moderate COL (although rent and expenses keep rising yearly while our stipends don't or barely match up with inflation). 

\- I have lived with roommates for the last three years. 

  
**TIP #1**

**Sharing an apartment** **with roommates:** I know living with roommates can be overbearing at times (it is for me too!) but sharing a space with other people not only brings down the cost of living for me, it also allows me a much-needed space to communicate and relax, especially after a tedious day of research. On average, I save about $400-600 a month by not renting a studio or a one-bedroom apartment for myself and living with two other people. By ensuring that I room with people who are on the same page as me in terms of policies around shared spaces and general etiquette, the living situation turns out to be a little less overwhelming (problems persist at times; when it does, we try to talk it out). 



**TIP #2**

**Budget:** Personal budgeting is my single biggest friend. Apart from the rent and utilities, I budget for everything else. I generally use Walmart, and have a general sense of what I would buy for the next two weeks, which I keep adding to my Walmart cart. If my budget for the next two weeks is $100, I will add and subtract products from my cart unless I can bring my total cart value under $100. I hop on a bus, shop, and take an Uber back home. Saves me from getting unnecessary stuff that I do not need by getting into the process two or three days in advance and adding or subtracting products from my cart over two or three days until I can bring the cart value under my budget. 

  
**TIP #3**

**Meal Prep:** Meal prepping has been one of those facets of life I had never considered in my first year of grad school, but it has been an unexpected blessing. I meal prep for 4 days (only dinners), having to only cook two times a week. If I am cooking on Sunday, I am covered till Wednesday dinner. For lunch, I generally go for low-effort meals; it saves time and money while allowing me to enjoy the luxury of freshly cooked meals. (Sandwiches are my go-to; cheap, flavorful, and take less than 15 minutes.)

  
**TIP #4**

**Use bank sign-up bonuses and apps that allow for cashback when you shop:** Many US banks offer sign-up bonuses when you open accounts or credit cards with them (you need a valid SSN and direct deposits made from your payroll for this!) and apps offer additional cashback when you use their portal to shop online. A quick and easy way to make some extra money on the side. This income is taxed; however, it is ""free"" money. 

  
**TIP #5**

  
**Going out on a budget:** I enjoy an outing every now and then. At least, I used to. These days, an outing with friends is generally a potluck. We cook some of our favorite meals and gather around. Same enjoyment with a fraction of the cost. I also take advantage of free events hosted by the university to socialize with people. 

  
**TIP #6**

**Thrifting:** Utilize thrifting for clothes - healthy for the planet and saves you a bunch of money. 

  
**TIP #7** 

**Subscriptions:** I have no recurring subscriptions. One of the most beneficial subscriptions for graduate students is Amazon Prime and Netflix. For Amazon purchases, I plan them out as I do with Walmart and get the total cart value above $35 every time I need something from Amazon. And these purchases are not impulsive either - I buy shampoo, toothpaste, and other essentials in bulk; the cost upfront is larger, but if I have to use it over the span of the next 3 months, why not get them together to save on delivery fees? For Netflix, I share the subscription with my two roommates. You can also get by without the subscription and resorting to a VPN and you know ...   


**TIP #8** 

**Passive Income:** I will sometimes review people's SOPs and profiles for graduate school admissions or work on Fiverr as a content writer since I have a lot of experience in both. However, time constraints have stopped me from doing this as much as I would like. (And no, I am not looking to review SOPs and profiles right now.) 



**TIP #9** 

**Scholarships/Fellowships/Grants:** Keep looking for those. Many universities offer short-term internal scholarships, fellowships, or assistantships to students that can even offset a part or whole of your tuition fee for the semester.    



I wished somebody had provided me with these tips and tricks before I started grad school; however, I write this in the hopes of someone benefiting from these. This is a tiring third year of my PhD program and all of this is written down from my own experiences. I am curious to know if there are other ways people are saving money. **TIP#4** is a very efficient way to rack up vouchers, sign-up bonuses, and cashback, making my lean wallet just a tad bit fatty every now and then (you can leave a comment here if you want to know more). Also, making sure to budget and using a dedicated app for it always helps! 

  
Edit: Since some of you reached out to me about how to open a bank account for bonuses, I understand how one might not be familiar with the process. I don't want to make this a promotional post, so please DM me in case you're wondering how to proceed. ",2024-10-31 05:13:12

GradSchool,1gg97ma,Autistic and ND Undergrads/Grad Students... Tell me about your experiences,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gg97ma/autistic_and_nd_undergradsgrad_students_tell_me/,19,"Hi

Tangentally related context: I'm an AuDHD graduate student and studying ABA academically, for many reasons but a big part is understanding where the disconnect is. My academic background is in STEM/med/neuroscience so this is really just adding another component to that.

Anyways, so in my search for support resources for myself at the graduate level, with subpar results... I have an opportunity to embark on a passion project of sorts and I (think) I'd like the opinion of the interwebs. There are some schools around the country that have various infrastructures around autism/neurodivergence/adhd and support all in various capacities, and I'm looking to set up an improved/similar infrastructure to for this demo in Chicago. I go to UIC, so having something like this there would be huge, and it would definitely set the stage for something statewide.

What I'm interested in is any/everything anyone is comfortable in sharing to help me create a bigger picture than I have. This is just the brainstorming stage for my team. I am interested in anything, but here are some focus questions:

1. undergraduate or graduate?
2. What was your experience like overall? why? any thought in hindsight what could've helped?
3. Maybe not then, but do you know now what you struggle with/what your support needs are?
4. Dream world, pragmatism be damned: what do you wish this level of academia had for students like us? why?

For me a lot if not a majority of my issues aren't directly school related. I have echoic/photographic memory so grades are not a barometer of how I'm actually doing. My issues are indirectly related and no one can argue they don't effect functionality.... i.e.  I started college in 2009, have 2 degrees already and haven't been able to go consecutively for longer than a year and a half, I watch the sun come up at least 60% of the week. I don't have/acknowledge hunger/fullness cues, etc.

The infrastructure I'd like to create would be able to primarily focus on those indirect issues that 100% effect the student and are outside current models of support in disability resource centers on campus. Anyways thanks for the feedback... lol please be nice.",2024-10-31 07:51:24

I’m in a shitty situation that came out of nowhere this past week. Looking for feedback and advice. 

I was on a partial medical leave negotiated with my department for the spring and last summer after I had an acute reaction that almost killed me to Covid that I contracted while teaching (mandatory for everyone in the program). I was on probation during that time because I hadn’t taken my candidacy exam yet. 

Came back in August to take the exam, passed, and was taken off probation. They asked I submit my dissertation proposal by the end of this semester. Tried to schedule the meeting with my faculty last week and suddenly two of them are just telling me and the department they have too much on their plates to continue (one is a Dean and the other just got a whole new center the university is creating dumped on them).

I wouldn’t balk at trying to replace them but the department is now saying if I can’t get enough faculty on my committee by the time they want the proposal (which is already, outlined, sourced, etc) that they will have to cancel my funding/essentially ending my time in the program. 

I have about 2-3 weeks to find people to get on board my project or I’ll be very unlikely to meet this December deadline. My committee chair is furious that this is happening and is trying to see why the department isn’t giving me a fair amount of time to replace my faculty. 

My graduate school has one person who does grad student disability accommodations and evals and I found out the school has no official sick/medical leave policies as each department is so different (total bs if you ask me but…). I want to know if it seems to be retaliation that the grad school had my department handle my sick leave negotiation but now is holding it against me for not showing “adequate progress” towards the degree. 

I have no bad or failing grades. I even presented original research on a panel in April despite being super ill. I’m in good standing and my project chair is/was very excited about my dissertation project proposal. This is all very out of left field.

I am a PHD student at a fairly prestigious university. This past year I've taken on multiple undergraduates and I am TA-ing general ed courses, and I had high expectations for the competency of the students at this university. Something I've noticed is a SEVERE lack of basic computer literacy amongst current undergrads. For example, I was teaching an undergrad how to use an image editing software for some microscopy analysis, and their mac was struggling to handle the file sizes. I asked them to open their activity monitor/task manager, and they had zero idea as to what I was talking about. I then asked them about a handful of other basic computer questions (Do you know how file sizing works? Do you know the difference between a web browser and a search engine? Do you know what an operating system is? etc. ) and they were clueless. This particular student also had over 20k files in their downloads folder, and didn't know they had to empty their trashcan (filled with about 100 GB) for files to actually be removed from their laptop. I helped them remove that bloat from their mac and \*magically\* their laptop was way faster. I want to direct them & other undergrads to a very basic guide on computer literacy. I can make a guide for them from scratch, however being a PHD student I really don't have a ton of time to build a resource like that, and wanted to know if anyone here had some resources/sites that could concisely explain the basics of how a computer works?

In my freshman year, I failed most of my classes due to some personal things and the dean of my university was unable to get them excused. My overall GPA is low but my major GPA is excellent and I've chosen 4 universities to apply to. I'm the first generation at university and no one in my family has anything like a master's, am I crazy for applying? I just want to stay in university because I love it and feel like I haven't had enough time in college and learning within my field.  Is this a real reason to go to grad school? Has anyone been in my situation before? I'm lost and would appreciate some guidance or assistance! Thank you all so much!",2024-10-30 21:32:35

My advisors (co-advised) take a few months (4-6 months) to give me feedback on my manuscripts. Sometimes they get comments back to me within a month of two.  One manuscript took 1 year to get it looked at, just for them to split my project in two and give 1/2 to one of my advisors.

We meet twice a month to discuss methods and sometimes analysis results, but then it takes them forever to give feedback on writing/narrative. 

I'm in my fifth year, defending in a few weeks, and I only now have 1 paper in review, which I started in 2019.

But, I have no idea what SciSpace.io is or why this request is coming this way.  It's some sort of AI research summarizer/tool?  In which case, why am I getting a request for a full PDF?

The request had a name attached to it but the only way to respond was to upload it to the scispace.io website portal.  I'd rather just send it directly to the requester directly, but that doesn't seem possible.

I have to take weeks from work to go to excavations, seminars. And I can't take into consideration wonderful stuff that require longer periods away from my kid (summer schools, for example).
I could wait until my kid grows but in 10 more years wouldn't it be absurdly late to start in archaeology?

I am interested in working in the mental health industry, possibly in a clinical or research setting. I realized that means I would most likely need a PhD in psychology.

It is too late for me to change my major as I am a super super senior who has taken many years off college and many have recommended that I just focus on graduating as soon as possible with my current major.

For a little bit of context, I've let my mental health disorders affect my college life to the extent where I now have a sub 3.0 overall GPA. I don't know if this is relevant, but my major GPA should be a bit higher because I have one D and maybe one B or C. I've received mostly As and A-s on the rest of the sociology courses. More importantly, however; I have a lot of Ws and Fs on my transcript because I could not take care of myself well enough to finish multiple semesters.

Considering all this, do you guys think there is any chance I can actually get into a graduate program?

usually ppl give me advice like ""just do it!"" or ""delete distractions!"" or ""pray to jesus"" (my mom said this lol). but none worked. now i know the trick to get me to write more effectively is to shift my perspective and have a more positive attitude about what research means for me. it's a matter of framing! 

instead of focusing on how much i don't want to produce bad work or how stupid i might be, i now think about how interesting this field is and how this whole process can get me closer to the answers for my questions.

Hi everyone,

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Network and Cybersecurity from a French university (Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1) in September. I’ve been offered the opportunity to pursue a PhD in IoT Networks at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, which is a highly reputed institution here in France.

My goal after completing the PhD is to work in the industry, specifically in R&D teams to contribute to innovation. Also I would like to gain experience in North America as tech opportunities and research is flourishing there.

I have a few questions:

- Is a PhD really useful for landing good positions in the industry, especially in research and development roles?
- How difficult is it to move to North America (USA & Canada) after a PhD in France? I've heard there are a lot of visa issues, especially for the USA.
- If not, what are the best methods to apply to universities in the USA or Canada?

GradSchool,1gehilw,"Feeling Bad about a ""Professional Masters""",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gehilw/feeling_bad_about_a_professional_masters/,5,"I started a program where I'd graduate with a professional masters versus a masters of science. My program involves me being employed full-time and taking these courses part-time, 2 a semester. The program will conclude with a capstone/first-author pre-print. 

However, I just can't get over the existential dread of have a degree that's often associated with less work/credibility. I passed up PhD acceptances twice because I was getting cold feet/didn't ""enjoy"" science enough to want to do it for 6 years. However, I'm realizing that in order to progress in my field, a PhD almost seems necessary and a Professional Masters is not sufficient, at all.

Despite good grades, including full marks and accolades on my first-year thesis, I didn't find any fulfillment in what I was doing. In fact, I had no clue what I was doing. While I enjoyed my subject, I struggled to connect my studies to a broader purpose or sense of direction. Long story short, I failed to complete my second year more than once and eventually stepped away.

I am now a returning graduate student. Somehow, I eventually identified what had originally brought me to my studies, and I'm now finding much more joy and fulfillment in a more practically oriented field, adjacent to my original one. Consequently, I've developed very different career goals.

I was accepted into a new graduate school last year, and I feel like I've been given a second chance. I don't want to waste it. I want to do things right this time, and learn as much as I can from the best in the field.

I'm now attempting to secure a very competitive internship opportunity. However, I'm relatively old compared to my peers, and I have this huge failure hanging over my academic record. Nevertheless, I feel like this failure is an integral part of my journey.

How bad of an idea would it be to describe this failure in the introduction of my personal statement, as a way to explain how I got where I am?

GradSchool,1ge953f,Need Guidance for Student Conduct Meeting After Withdrawal—What to Expect and How to Prepare,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ge953f/need_guidance_for_student_conduct_meeting_after/,1,"Hi all,

I’m seeking advice on how to prepare for a meeting with a student conduct officer at a graduate school whose online master's program I was enrolled in for two months before withdrawing. I want to handle this meeting as effectively as possible. Here’s the context:

**The Situation:** I received an email from the testing center flagging my behavior during an online proctored exam (Biochemistry Exam 4), specifically mentioning that I appeared to be looking off-screen. The email warned that further issues could lead to a formal conduct report.

Here’s where things get complicated:

* This warning email arrived two weeks after the exam in question. By that time, I had already taken and submitted another exam (Histology). In fact, I completed two exams after Biochemistry Exam 4. If we include the Immunology and Microbiology exam that I took on the same day as Biochemistry, that totals three exams. During all of these exams, I looked off-screen a few times to think. Prior to each exam, we conduct a thorough 360-degree environmental check. There were instances during exams when I got very close to the screen and almost accidentally exited the exam due to how I swiped my mouse, which triggered a warning popup on Examplify. However, that did not trigger any emails from the Testing and Evaluation Services team.
* In response to the initial warning, I proactively emailed the testing center, acknowledging the warning and apologizing for my behavior. I promised to be more cautious moving forward. In the email, I clarified that I also looked off-screen a few times during my Histology exam and mentioned that I received their email warning two weeks after my Biochemistry exam, leaving me no time to rectify any behavior that may have been flagged. I want to emphasize that absolutely no cheating has occurred in any of my exams. However, I did not receive a response.
* Furthermore, I completed quizzes for Histology (and all my other courses) under the same proctored conditions with no problems reported.

Instead, I later received an official conduct complaint notice from a student conduct officer, which escalated the situation to a formal process.

**Withdrawal from the Program:** As a result of the increased stress and irregular communication from the testing center, I opted to withdraw from the program on October 23, 2024 . The added stress of this program means I no longer have breathing room to prepare as well as I can for my MCAT. It was stupid and impossible to do both amazingly in retrospect. My parents were angry because I wasn't making any progress on the MCAT and I was driving myself insane, falling behind in one or the other and sacrificing precious time. In spite of this, I am concerned about the possible implications of this conduct process for my academic record and future plans, especially since my goal was to improve my academic standing for medical school applications.

**Concerns:**

1. **Student Conduct Process Continuing After Withdrawal:** It seems that the conduct process can still proceed despite my withdrawal. I am anxious that this might lead to a reportable mark on my academic record, which could significantly harm my chances for medical school. These processes usually result in some sort of sanction against the student, regardless of how strong my case is that I did nothing wrong.
2. **Inconsistent Warnings:** This was not my first online exam in the program; I had taken several proctored exams under the same conditions, all graded without issue. I even reached out to classmates, who confirmed they only received standard reminders about scratch paper disposal and similar matters. No specific guidelines were shared regarding looking off-screen, making the delayed notice feel out of place.
3. **Lack of Evidence or Witnesses:** The program is entirely online, and I was alone during the exam, with a cleared desk and no resources around me. The student conduct guidelines mention witnesses, but gathering them in this case seems impractical. I have no one who can vouch for me since I was alone and proctored remotely.
4. **Stress from Program and Personal Obligations:** I was performing well in my courses overall (all A’s except for Histology, which had one missed quiz). Balancing MCAT preparation, work shifts, and coursework was challenging, and I enrolled in this program specifically to strengthen my medical school application. The thought of this incident damaging everything I have worked for is truly disheartening.

**What I Need Help With:**

1. **Preparing for the Meeting:** What should I focus on? Should I emphasize the lack of intent to cheat, the timing issues with the testing center’s communication, or something else entirely?
2. **Making My Case:** Would it be effective to highlight procedural inconsistencies, such as the delayed notification and lack of explicit instructions about what constitutes suspicious behavior (e.g., looking off-screen)? I know peers who had family members walk into the room while they were taking exams or had background noise as a result.
3. **Potential Outcomes:** I would appreciate insight into the potential outcomes from this type of meeting, especially since I am no longer enrolled. Is there any way to ensure that this process does not result in a reportable mark on my record?

I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to navigate this meeting to minimize potential consequences. Thank you in advance! Currently, I have a Z grade for Histo, which will be updated after this process. I’ve read the handbook and noted their long and convoluted procedure, which includes gathering witnesses, advocates, and even attorneys or even my parents. Please keep in mind that this was an online exam that I completed in 40 minutes.",2024-10-28 18:19:44

Since I’m not starting grad school right away, I was thinking of taking a gap year to work as a barista or in a café to save up some money and take a break from the academic grind. I enjoy the idea of working somewhere social and different from a lab or fieldwork setting for a while. But I’m wondering, will this look bad to grad school admissions committees?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s taken a non-applicable job in a gap year. Did it have any impact on your applications? Should I try to squeeze in more research experience, or would it be okay to take this time to recharge?

I'm applying to grad school right now and I want to start sending out my requests for LOR. I plan on asking the lab director at my internship from this past summer as well as my current research advisor. I'm struggling to come up with a third person to ask and 3 are required. I have no professors that I'm close with (in any capacity). I've done no TAing and all my lab classes are overseen by grad students so its not like I can have a professor who supervised me speak on my abilities. I haven't really taken relevant classes recently as I did all my major classes early and have spent the last 2 years basically doing gen-eds that I coasted through with enough effort to get As but having 0 class participation. I'm not super sure who to ask for my last rec letter. I'm starting a job, actually today, but I don't think there's enough time for me to work there before it being appropriate to ask (apps are due dec 15). I've had a job since I was a sophomore in HS that I still work at every winter and summer break where they love me, but I'm not sure if its a good idea since I just work as a host at a sushi restaurant.

I had my real analysis midterm yesterday. I think I’m going to score around 10 or 15 out of 25. I still have the final left, which I don’t know how bad I’ll do in. 

I basically had health issues and f*cked around not taking things seriously the past couple of days, and now I so regret to studying for this test. 😭 

I’m going to be an international applicant straight out of undergrad from the highest ranked university in Bangladesh for Fall ‘26 applications for PhD Econ programs in the US. I will have a CGPA of at least 3.9/4. My other quantitative courses include Calculus 1-3 (AAA), Linear Algebra (A), Differential Equations (A), Statistics (A), Econometrics (A), Time Series, Game Theory, Operations Research. I have 1.5yrs experience as a TA for intermediate microeconomics, and will likely add an RA-ship and maybe a research job at a local economic policy think tank. I hope I will have decent GRE scores (let’s hope Q160+), and decent LoRs. What are my odds? 

I am sorry if I sound childish, but I have been beating myself up over not preparing for real analysis well enough. I cannot believe I let my midterm go like this just for a few days of chill. I don’t think I’ll have time to retake this course. How will this affect my application package?

My parents financed my first 3 years of undergrad so I can slowly get on my feet, for which I am eternally grateful.  

Currently I have little less than a month to do a 20,000-word long dissertation, with only 7,000 words completed thus far. Between now and the deadline, I will have one week-long conference abroad that my work is organising (so a lot of work for me, 10-12h days, and a full week away from home) and then two weeks of holidays to complete the thesis. 

  
People, incl. my boss and colleagues, tell me all will be ok, and that many have completed their master thesis while working full-time. I feel like if I had only done one semester of the combo, it would be doable. But after 4 years of full-time education and work (some years part-time, some years full-time), and overall 7 years of full-time higher education (why not do a combo of 5-year long BA and 2-year long MA in clashing educational systems in 3 different countries, right?), I am out of energy. 

(Note: I know this situation is actually a lot less stressful in many ways than graduating into the current job market with little work experience, and applications and possible relocations looming ahead.)

So, how do you all, who worked and studied for multiple years rather than 1 final semester (no shade, just different situation in my opinion), do it? Where do you find the energy?  I feel like I have been running a marathon at intensity of a sprint, and my legs are now giving up in the last couple hundred meters when I am expected to actually have an intense burst of energy to increase my speed, but the tank has not been filled in so long, and the reserves are out.

My dad has been pressuring me to apply for a masters to make myself more competitive in the market, but I didn't go through undergrad with the intent to go into grad school. In blunt terms, this means I have no research and minimal relationship with my professors.

With all this being said, what's the play? I initially wanted to do a research based program, but it seems that with no prior research experience and generic letters of rec, I'll be an unappealing applicant. Should I go with a course-based masters, which I'm less keen on but which seem to be easier to get into with the type of qualifications I have?

I'm at a sub-60 in both classes right now. I've since pivoted to a Philosophy Theology double major, but I wanna know if I should even plan on going for a PHD or not because I heard even 1-2 bad grades can lock you out of the top schools. I really like both subjects and have always been a lot stronger with language than math, but I don't wanna spend 4 years and hit a ceiling where I can't get a doctorate in a doctorate-centric field. Now, my school does a cool thing where they'll replace your lowest test grade with your final exam, and if I do REALLY well from here on out I can still pull like an 84-87 in both classes, but I can't withdraw from either due to my scholarship requirements. 

  
I heard Philosophy programs in particular is a pain to get into, and I have a very narrow type of Philosophy I'm interested in (Philosophy of Religion, particularly concerning the descriptions and ethical nature of Heaven and Hell, per the scripture) and a lot of the others don't seem very interesting, I'm a pretty good writer, or so I've been told, so I'm not as concerned about the writing sample. I'm also not very concerned with the GRE as I got an OKAY-ish score (1200-1300, I believe?) on the SAT without studying and that was with me absolutely bombing the math section once again (a problem of mine, I know) I just want to make sure I'm set to continue, I currently am on the deans list with a 3.8 from dual credit, coming out of a 4.6 in High School and I have As in the rest of my classes.

  
I'm currently at a community college and my Physics professor has a crazy accent but I am PLANNING on transferring to Clemson soon, or Duke if I win the lottery and can pay their out-of-state tuition.

  
College, in general, has been a big change from me barely trying in High School, so that's really the issue here, It's not so much that the content is exceedingly hard, I do fine on the labs and whatnot, but I just don't know HOW to study at all, and as a result of having both ADHD and ASD I have a really hard time just sitting down and reading 80 pages of a textbook,  I've also noticed that the professors seem to have a taste for highlighting 5 or so sections for the test and making 80% of the questions on the last 2 sections, which makes me particularly ticked off.

  
TLDR: I am probably going to get a C in two of my non-major-related classes and want to know if I should keep going on the graduate path of Philosophy/Theology ( I really want to) or give up and become a day trading business major.",2024-10-28 01:50:00

While I do use it to come up with ideas or when I'm stuck on how to phrase something, I write my own work and only use it as a tool to help me organize things better. I decided to do a free trial of Grammarly to run a section of my proposal through to see if it's being flagged as AI - and it says 100% of my writing is AI generated. This is literally not the case and I'm honestly afraid that my professor will do the same and take that at face value even though I am the one writing this paper. Does anyone else have this issue or know how I can get around it? I don't want to dumb my paper down - I'm really good at academic writing and want to show that, but I feel like I have to purposely make it worse to be able to ""prove"" that I'm not using AI. I have to get a good grade on this proposal to pass the class and keep my 4.0 and it's stressing me out like hell because I've heard horror stories of people getting expelled or failed in a class for this exact reason. Is it worth reaching out to my professor about??

Edit to add, since maybe I wasn't clear: I am not using AI to write sections of my paper - I have used it in the past for ideation to come up with lists of potential topics to explore when I need help with what direction to go in since I have a hard time narrowing in on topics. I use Grammarly, which is considered AI, to correct grammatical issues I may have missed and awkward wording. It's not writing my papers for me, period. Grammarly is something past professors have encouraged me to use, so I feel comfortable using it even though it is considered AI. I only use ChatGPT for ideation, not for any writing or structural things. I'm concerned because I have seen my peers write their own papers and then are failed for using AI even though they did not, regardless of what proof they had to show for it. I am good at academic writing, which some people seem to have a problem with me saying lol. I also work in AI and know that my writing does not read like AI (because it is not written by AI), but the way I structure things is formal and that seems to be what's getting flagged. When it is flagged, it's for ""resembling AI text"", not straight up AI generated - and I've only run it through Grammarly. These programs are notoriously inaccurate, but professors at my university take the scores from them at face value and often don't care what students have to say about it, which is why I'm concerned.",2024-10-26 20:31:28

I started as a research assistant before enrolling in the master’s program, so my current visa is tied to my work contract, which ends in December. Although I expect my contract to be renewed, the process has been so slow that I’m getting increasingly anxious as the days pass. I've been fortunate to get funding to attend a conference that coincides with my contract’s end date, but I’m very concerned that my renewal won’t be processed in time, which would prevent me from reentering the country and finishing everything I’m working on. On top of that, my progress on my current project has stalled, creating some tension with my supervisor. I think the combination of managing the master’s, visa application to attend the conference, contract renewal, research project, finances, and being here alone has left me feeling constantly on edge.

So, last Friday, the IT department ran a phishing campaign, and I was one of the ""lucky"" ones who got an email supposedly from the CEO asking for my phone number. My mind immediately went crazy—I thought I was about to be fired over the phone. Looking at the email now, it’s almost ridiculous that I thought it was real; it’s obviously fake, but I guess my mind is in alert mode all the time lately. I went to my supervisor’s office and asked if I was about to be fired. He said he didn’t know anything about it and found it strange that I was even getting emails from the CEO. After that, I asked in a group chat if anyone was playing a prank on me. I think it was pretty obvious I was having a breakdown. I was about to cry in the hallway.

I ended up leaving the office and heading to my classes, and on the way, I realized it had been a phishing attempt. I started to come back to my senses. I took a walk around the neighborhood to clear my head, went to a restaurant and ordered my favorite dessert. For the first time in who knows how long, I actually felt calm and noticed I wasn’t on edge anymore.

Fast forward to today, and I’m feeling better, but I’m honestly still shocked by my mental state these past few days and how unaware I was of it. I’m also a little embarrassed about showing up on Monday, knowing people saw me like that.

Some days it is taking me like 3-4 hours to just read 20 pages. I don't get distracted on my phone, I just cannot follow sentences or pick out information like I used to. My mind doesn't trail off, I can get like sucked into something for hours, but my brain is just slower. 

Because it is taking me longer to do my work, I am having to stretch this into the weekends, what was originally supposed to be sacred time away from school. I have been working 7 days a week, probably around 60 hours or so.

Coasting and staying seems pointless besides getting another degree paper.

I know this question might sound a bit situational and generic.

I'm in the process of applying for PhD's in Cognitive Science (US) and would be greatful to hear from current PhD students about their experiences with the application process. I’ve connected with faculty at two schools (RIT and UT Dallas).whose work closely aligns with my own interests—they think I’d be a good fit. I’ve got a few calls lined up next week to talk through details and see if we’re truly a match, but I'm still wondering about my chances of getting accepted.

My question is: before you applied, did you feel pretty confident about your chances of getting accepted? For some context, I had a 4.0 undergrad GPA and around a 3.6 (Merit grade) in my Master’s in the UK. I’ve co-authored and published a research paper and did quite a bit of research during my Master’s (thesis + coursework). Alongside that, I have a fair amount of professional experience in project management, data analytics and even founded a startup. My Bachelor’s was in Psychology, and my Master’s in Neuroscience. I don’t have any formal teaching or lecturing experience, though.

Does this sound like a profile that would have a solid chance? I’m planning to apply to 2 or 3 programs, but given time constraints and application costs (I’m aiming to start next fall), I’d really like to focus on places where I’d have a strong shot.

I’m quite lost on this so hopefully someone can point me to the right direction. I’m in my last year uni studying international relations in Vancouver Canada. Over the past two years I have become more and more interested in social theory. 

But the sociology department in my school offer very few courses in social theory. I have taken one but that was during my exchange in NUS (which offer more theory courses). So I read into the subject on my own time and I started to write down my own analysis. Over the past couple of months, those ideas actually came together and became a pretty coherent essay that establishes a coherent framework, though it is quite long (33000 words). 

Since then, I started thinking about pursuing graduate school, but I don’t actually know whether I’m actually suitable for academia or whether my essay can be of any academic value for me. I tried reaching out to professors in my schools sociology department, but understandably I don’t actually know them and not much has come from that.

I have to graduate soon and it is unlikely that I can take more courses in sociology (they don’t interest me that much anyways) to build relationships with professors. If I have a strong interest in this subject and have something to show for, what can I do? Who should I talk to and how? Is there something I'm missing?

I’m considering private graduate admissions advising services at the moment, but other than that I'm not sure what I can do.

Thanks everyone. ",2024-10-26 19:10:17

I'm in undergrad rn for literature and I love it so much. I don't think there's anything I'd enjoy doing more than this! I also don't know what kind of ""industry job"" I could possibly enjoy, other than publishing which is also very competitive and not well-paid.

I have been asking my profs about what they think about grad school esp. regarding finances. TLDR version: my family don't have money to support me and I have a health situation that makes it extremely difficult to work next to classes. Right now I am subsisting on my student loans which grant me about 200 quid spending money after bills (rent, insurance, utilities) to buy groceries with and such. It's a tight fit sometimes but I've experienced worse. From my profs I get a lot of different responses, some say it is not worth it, others say stuff like ""it'll be tough but if you love it you should do it"" and others are so positive that I feel like they're just making it look better than it is. I see a lot of people online talking about how humanities phd's are the route to poverty. But when I look at the few ads for candidate positions, the monthly rate is better than what my mum made growing up (and still makes haha). I also see a lot of people discuss how punishing the workload is, but I have to confess I prefer taking 3 classes (my uni recommends 2 classes at a time max) over a regular uni schedule + a job in retail or food service.

I'm feeling a bit lost and don't really know what to do, I guess. I don't want to be an academic superstar or anything, I just want to do what I love... but what if it's a bad decision? Can I even get in when I'm poor and disabled? This dilemma seriously keeps me awake at night. I'd love to hear from other people in the humanities who come from lower class economic backgrounds about their financial situations. Also, if you are in a similar health situation that really impacts your energy levels erratically, I want to hear about what it is/was like for you in grad school.

Edit: I don't really have to worry about massive loans for my Masters thankfully, it is much cheaper in Europe.",2024-10-26 07:52:43

I am a European PhD student on a scholarship at the beginning of my 2nd year out of 3, focusing on the intersection of AI and finance. I began my PhD immediately after completing my Master's in Computer Science. I enjoy the applied aspects of my research, but I'm feeling uncertain about the PhD experience itself.

My advisor is very supportive, and the lab environment is decent, but I often struggle with the limited resources—poor equipment and inadequate workspaces—and I lack a collaborative team in a more practical sense (working on the project). Currently, I'm dividing my time between applied research and theoretical research about methodology, but I've encountered a year of failed experiments, leaving me feeling conflicted.

I recognize that this is a significant opportunity, yet I've lost sight of my motivation for pursuing the PhD. From the beginning, I thought, ""If things don't go well, I can always drop out,"" but lately, I've been contemplating this option more frequently. I’m considering transitioning to a career in finance, specifically as a Quant, which aligns closely with the applied aspects of my PhD. However, I'm also interested in other directions within machine learning, but I'm worried I might regret leaving the program.

Do you think that in my case maybe a Quant position it is not a very good fit?
Is a PhD very necessary for working as a Quant? Is it normal to think about dropping out on a daily basis? Lastly, do you have any suggestions for a theoretical framework to help guide my decision-making?

The reality is that I am interested in and could see myself working on many things, and it feels like I am being tested to see if I am interested in their specific question and specific species they use to answer those questions, but I always feel like if I repeat those things back to them that they will see right through me that I’m just ass kissing.

Both PIs are incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. I think either would make a great mentor for me. 
 
The first research group deals in research that I have experience in and a better handle on. I had a blast during my rotation because I actually understood what was going on for the most part. Reading through papers relevant to my rotation project was fun, because I understood the things I needed to know, and knew exactly where the gaps in my knowledge were, so I could ask the right questions to get myself up to speed. It's also more immediately applicable to my future goals. For context, they are a battery lab, and I would like to continue to do battery research in the future. Though I suppose that could change over the next few years. 
 
The downside to this lab is that the group itself is very small. They are a new group, so there are only 3 graduate students and 1 post doc who is on his way out. I get along with 1 of the graduate students, but the other two tend to keep to themselves. The PI herself is trying to develop a more friendly and collaborative group, but I have no way of knowing if she will succeed in this over the course of my PhD, or if the group environment will always be this awkward. Also, the nature of joining a new group means that funding is uncertain, and I may wind up TAing more than I would like to. 
 
The second group is a much more established one, the PI is pretty well known in their field. The group is a decent size, and the other graduate students are much friendlier and easy to get along with as a whole. Because of this, the PI is also able to do semi-regular events and outings which are a lot of fun. The research that this group deals with is still interesting to me, but much more fundamental than I was hoping for. For context, they deal with more fundamental electrochemistry and electrode material synthesis/characterization. Not necessarily for batteries, but it is certainly applicable to battery research, which is where my current interests lie, but less explicitly so. 
 
What do you think I should prioritize, or what other factors should I be taking into consideration? I would appreciate any guidance for this. Thanks in advance!",2024-10-25 17:48:02

I know that others have succeeded with issues too, but I am always trying to keep my head above water for basic needs like hygiene, sleep, eating, etc. I don't want to disappoint my supervisor by mastering out but I don't think I can continue doing this for another 3-4 years.

I graduated in 2020 with a BA in Psychology, and a minor in chemistry. I was pre-med all the way through, but decided not to go down that route (plus my GPA was only a 3.4). I did all my pre-reqs though.

I was a research assistant during undergrad, but due to my then undiagnosed ADHD and incompetent advisor, I don't expect to get any recommendation out of that.  After graduating I did a service year with Americorp (in a literacy program) and then 3 years as a finance admin assistant (my current job, which I hate)

My goal is to become a UX/UI designer, because it combines psychology and design, both of which I enjoy.

I haven’t take a GRE yet. Studying for it will probably be a struggle with my ADHD, but at least I can extra time on it since I'm diagnosed now. I know at least 3 people I can get good letters of recommendations from (1 former teacher, two managers).

I want to get into the best masters program possible, to make it easier to get a job in this terrible market we have right now.

I feel insecure about my chances of getting into a decent school, since it seems programs want applicants with recent, relevant research or work experience, neither of which I have. It also seems like they want some when that interesting and has clear direction in their lives, but I've been mostly aimless the past four years (depression) and I don't do anything particularly interesting. I literally work, eat, sleep, and repeat.

The closest thing I have to an interesting background is that I've written a few commissioned articles for a very small magazine dedicated to social change, one of which was actually published. That's it, pretty unremarkable.

Is it even possible to go to grad school? I just want to start making more money, since right now I can barely pay my bills and I hate doing the kind of jobs I'm qualified to do. I really think I'd make a great UX/UI designer, since I enjoy being creative, enjoy learning psychology, and I'm fascinated by design in general.

So I am a current MS student, looking to go to PhD Fall of 25. I'm in biology, specifically ecology and evolution. I was connected with two professors who are looking to co-advise a student at a pretty big state school, and I loved the program! During my interview/get to know you meeting they talked funding, teaching fellowships, and accepted an invitation to come to my masters defense. I also got put in contact with their current labs and got to talk to everyone I would be working with. It all went really really well and they said I would be hearing from them soon! But here is the issue: I've sent about 20 PhD inquiry emails and only had really one *good* interview. I've applied to the program I just described, but now I'm worried because if I don't get in here, I essentially have NO backup plan. My advisor is confident I have this PhD position and has advised that I just focus on my thesis at this point, but I still worry about not having a safety net.

So my question: from what I described about the process I have gone through so far, do you think I need to apply to other places? Is it worth the time and effort of finding other programs and applying? Really just want an outsiders perspective, I love my advisor but I worry that she is looking at it through rose tinted glasses.

GradSchool,1gadgkx,Applying to Grad School at 28 years old?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gadgkx/applying_to_grad_school_at_28_years_old/,19,"Hi everyone, I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Criminology from back in 2018. I joined the workforce after that and did not pursue further schooling.

For nearly two years I worked in domestic anti-human trafficking, before switching to a civil law firm. Almost a year ago, I quit and focused on part time work and volunteering. I did temporary contract work for a civilian simulated munitions company, and I’ve volunteered for a couple museums and regularly at a wildlife rescue (for nearly a year).

Three months after quitting the firm, I was hired to work in a museum as a Collections Assistant in the department of Vertebrate Paleontology, with some work in Invert Paleo later down the line. So, I’ve been employed at the museum for around seven months. I’ve done typical collection work, been out in the field, practiced in the prep lab, and learned a lot through osmosis.

It was through volunteering / the later employment that I realized my love, passion and appreciation for paleontology. Not to be corny, but for the first time in my life, I feel certain about what I want to do. I hope to work in this field until I am dead in the ground.

I’ve been considering grad school as a way to further my knowledge and open doors to future employment opportunities.

 I’ve been looking at a school associated with the museum I work at.

I am unsure of the right way to make myself an appealing candidate for a Biology master’s program, due to both my educational gap and prior degree. Criminology is in arts, so although I’ve taken Biology and Statistics and whatnot, I do not have the foundational classes (Calculus, Chemistry, more specialized classes) that a typical Biology master’s program looks for. A Master of Arts in Museum Studies has been suggested to me, but I have some insecurities about that route.

I decided to take supplemental undergrad classes as a start, but I’ve had to since withdraw from my chemistry class because of the math component.

I am **abysmally** bad at math. This is not an exaggeration. It’s always been a real problem for me. The procedures don’t stick, and if I manage to actually grasp them, they don’t transfer well to different problems. I wouldn’t be shocked if I had dyscalculia, but that wasn’t really known/diagnosed when I was a kid.

- Can anyone relate to my educational gap or pursuit of a program unaligned with prior degree?
- How did you overcome this? 
- How can I overcome this and make myself a valuable applicant, in spite of my deficiencies?

Any advice helps — thanks for reading.",2024-10-23 15:33:30

GradSchool,1g9tdto,Thought I was dealing with a tick bite infection that messed up my whole month… test result today came back negative and now I feel awkward and behind ,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g9tdto/thought_i_was_dealing_with_a_tick_bite_infection/,38,"So about a month ago, I woke up to a small brown insect on the back of my right leg in bed in my new apartment. We also had a mouse problem in the apartment at that time for what it’s worth. 

A couple days later, I began to have increasing rashes and itchiness all over my body, new spots popping up each day. It started with behind both knees before spreading to my legs, torso, armpits, arms, etc as the days progressed 

I also began to have random shivering and chills at night until I was unable to sleep several nights on end, despite trying hard to 

I also started noticing cognitive decline, memory issues, focus issues, and a need to turn everything in at absolute last second… otherwise overwhelming anxiety and brain fog

I also began to have increasing nerve/joint inflammation and stiffness  - neck, back, pelvis.. one day even my ankle was randomly on fire 

I chalked all these things up to stress and didn’t take it seriously 

Then all of a sudden last week, the symptoms hit me like a freight train. I was unable to sleep AT ALL 2 nights in a row, was shivering constantly, and could not think straight. I was increasingly smoking weed to deal with the physical pains and lack of appetite and sleepiness 

Then, last Wednesday, it became very very hard to even sit. So much physical pain. Heart palpitations. Shortened/strained breath. Could not stretch my stomach without pain. Kept being hunched over. Kept falling asleep. Dozing off. All muscles and joints on fire. Began to cry from all the pain 

Emailed all my professors that I was going to urgent care, went to urgent care, bawled my tears out in pain, got antibiotics… have felt 80% reduction in all symptoms ever since, these last 5 days 

While waiting on the blood test results from urgent care, I went to the university health center yesterday to discuss the situation 

The nurses are the university health center said based on my full description of symptoms, timeline, and my positive reaction to the antibiotics, my suspicion of the tick bite made total sense 

However, today the test result came back from urgent care… negative 

This is so confusing to me. I am seeing that apparently, Lyme antibodies are not produced until 4-6 weeks after infection, so false negatives are actually common if individuals get tested **too early**,…

But at the end of the day, the test result was declared “negative” and now I am totally stuck on how to communicate with my professors 

I have rapidly fallen behind deadlines in ALL classes + my research + my impressions with my PI and professor due to my total sloppiness and lethargy and lack of communication this entire month 

Last month, everything was okay and I was actually ahead of the game in so many ways

Now… I feel so behind, so awkward, and a degree of shame as if I lied and made all this up to get away with multiple assignment deadlines this last week 

Yet… I was 100% in intense pain, with various symptoms, this whole month now 

I just can no longer provide a concrete confirmation I guess, and that’s making me really overwhelmed right now emotionally, especially since I am in such a small cohort 

My professors have emailed me saying I need to submit my pending assignments 

I do not want to identity with a Lyme diagnosis and use it for pity or a get out of jail free card… but I truly believe I was clearly struggling with *something* physical, that the antibiotics have *clearly* helped these last 5 days 

I’ve never been in a such situation where a health matter affected my whole day to day… but now I also feel delusional reading a lot of the online conversation about Lyme 

This was all brand new to me 

A couple of my professors have been sympathetic and told me to take my time but I still just feel so awkward right now, In multiple ways… as if I am awaking from a 1 month haze 

Yeah you could say it was the weed but then tell me why since starting antibiotics, my desire to smoke weed has decreased significantly as well 

I truly believe I was dealing with a legitimate infection but now I’m stuck as to what to communicate and how to get back on track 

I do NOT want to make excuses. I do want to revive my momentum and excel. But I feel that this has soured my impression with PI/professors and momentum a lot  .. especially because now I can’t “prove” my suspicions of what I was dealing with 

And furthermore, if I indeed do have Lyme or some other tick/bug bite illness, that just wasn’t represented on this blood test, that’s still a stressful thing to think about as well right now on top of all my pending assignments and tasks ",2024-10-22 21:18:01

GradSchool,1ga4rh9,8 weeks into a PoliSci master’s and I want to quit,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ga4rh9/8_weeks_into_a_polisci_masters_and_i_want_to_quit/,4,"I graduated undergrad with a Polisci degree back in 2023 and I spent a year at my parents’ place looking for jobs while I passed the time with this remote paid internship. Nothing came of my job search and I was going stir crazy and needed a way to get out of the house (I had no friends in the area so it was just me and my parents there and while they love me and are nice to spend time with in moderation they’re extremely overbearing and helicoptery and refuse to respect my adulthood) so I let my parents talk me into going back to my Alma mater for a master’s.

Things seemed fine at first, although the work was much higher quantity and more tedious than what I’d done undergrad. However, it quickly became clear that the material itself was going to be radically different from undergrad in ways I didn’t care for at all. These courses seem to be much closer to applied science courses with a political backdrop, with most of the assignments consisting of reading 3-4 20-40 page studies a week and critiquing the nitty gritty of their methodology in some way, as well as doing one of the many, many steps to prep for our final papers.

Then, shit from my personal life blew up out of nowhere. When I moved into my off campus apartment that semester, the person who was supposed to be my roommate fucked off and never came back after his old roommate brought in a flea problem, the fleas resurfaced my 2nd week of classes, I was put in a hotel until they could fumigate the place, and a long chain of events involving me being falsely accused of and arrested for a serious crime ensued from there (I live in one of like two states where if a person complains about you to police the complainant can just go before a judge or magistrate and have you arrested and charged without even an investigation first). Being forced to don the orange jumpsuit for a day and having your phone held by police as “evidence” for a week and a half for shit that you didn’t do was, well, traumatizing, and I had to move back in with my parents and attend classes on Zoom for a couple weeks until we figured out what to do. My parents were able to get me a good lawyer and this shit’s pretty close to taken care of now, but it was terrifying at the time and was a constant source of stress my first few weeks.

Just when I thought things were finally starting to settle down, my area gets absolutely bodied by Hurricane Helene and half of town gets flooded. The university shuts down, at first for a week, then two, and that whole time I’m seeing constant horror stories of people losing their homes, so I assume that school is going to eventually decide to close the whole semester. 

Well, turns out they didn’t do that and we’re back after two weeks. Getting back into the flow of things after an unexpected two week break is hard enough, but my internet was wiped out by the storm and STILL hasn’t been fixed so doing work is much harder now and requires leaving my place. I already had to ask a teacher for an extension on something because of this and he was willing to give it, but he made it clear that he was only willing to make it a one time thing. This week, all of my teachers are kind of cramming in the assignments we missed at once. Tomorrow I have a critical reaction to 4 20-40 page readings, a critical review of a 400-page book, and a 10-source (20-40 page each scholarly articles like the readings) source matrix for my final paper all due. Needless to say, I’ve gotten maybe 9 hours of sleep total this week and I just can’t do this shit anymore. I tried all day to sit down in a local coffee shop with internet access to get these things taken care of and just couldn’t motivate myself, constantly distracted myself to take the edge off, and got nothing done. Eventually I just gave up, wrote a long text to my Dad about dropping out, and wrote this. What the hell do I even do at this point?

Barring all of these awful personal coincidences that I’m choosing to interpret as something up there screaming at me that grad school was a shit idea, I’m just making myself miserable for a degree I don’t even rly feel I need because dropping out would piss my parents off, but living with them again would also make me miserable. I just don’t know what to do.",2024-10-23 07:31:37

In previous meetings they had mentioned many times that I have PhD potential and could see me continuing on and then we had this conversation. This discouraged me for a few hours, but it made me actually want to reach out to other grad schools and see for myself (which is actually going pretty good). 

Now, they are worried because me and another grad student are going to graduate and she won’t have students for this larger project we are working on. She has now, for the past 2 days, mentioned me staying on as a PhD student and recruiting another student. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on whether what she said is true (about not being wanted) and how should I approach letting her down softly. I have enjoyed my MS and all the experience and things they have taught me, but I’m truly ready to move on to another school/program.

On recruiting email, PI said i will be working on a environment-funded project (the sole reason why I was interested in the first place) and spend the free time working on some side projects —> For a whole month working, the environment project has been assigned mainly to another guy, I’ll be helping him if needed. I spent most of time working on microbiology, sensors and gas chamber. 

3. PI said when I don’t have class I can sit and hangout in his lab —> he means when I don’t have class I need to work on his projects. Took a day off last week due to food poisoning, immediately got warning that “it’s ok to be absense due to sickness, but you still have to work for result to cover the day you take off. I need to report result too.” 

4. Never have any contract to sign and document to read about working term and condition —> still have no contract and working arrangement on paper. Payroll is not rolling yet. I know my uni HR system has registered me 10 hours on paper for his lab and I can clock in clock out for 10 hours now. But what about the 1k2 he discussed earlier? No sign to be seen. So technically I’m working 20 hours a week but only paid 10 hours. 

I know I’m an international student and this research lab is an opportunity to achieve better things for my career later. Not to mention the CV, the published paper, the LOR I could get from this. But deep down I’m just too overwhelmed and all over the place. I hate the 2 hours commuting time and the traffic. I hate going home at 7~8PM. I hate whenever I get home I have to do chores to take care of my brother and have no energy left to do homework. 

The pros I can see from this PI is: 

+ He responses really fast and very attentive. 
+ He has so many ideas and projects to do I will never run out of tasks and won’t get terminate for no task to assign anymore. 
+ He’s chill with time we go in and time we go out of lab, as long as he can catch us in the lab whenever he visits he’ll be happy. (He visits almost everyday) 
+ Lots of connections, lots of opportunity for career after graduation
+Very generous with equipments, will buy anything we request
+Teaches me more skills than just ECE ",2024-10-22 18:22:35

Hi all,

I’ve been having some existential doubts about whether or not the PhD path (comparative literature) is right for me, and, besides the stress of being far from my loved ones, which I’m not adjusting that well to, I’m also starting to worry about the prospect of starting a family while in a PhD program. 

I recently got engaged, and we’ve been talking about when we want to start a family. this has brought up a whole new level of anxiety around the PhD. It’s really important to me to have a family, and to be able to spend a lot of time with my kids. If I have a baby while in the PhD program, for example, will i just be stressed about school the whole time? Is it worth it to do both at the same time? 

I would be so grateful for anyone who might want to share anything about their experience with this. Additionally, what is the early academic career stage like, with small children? I can imagine it’s so stressful. All of you who have done it, or are currently doing it, are superstars, and I admire you so much!!


(For context, I started a PhD program in comp lit last year (R1, US). I like that the program is really flexible and the professors are really kind. My anxiety starts from the fact that I am not confident in the field itself, for one thing. I feel like comp lit is in its death throes at the moment, and it’s a bit depressing. For another, it’s hard to navigate my fiancé being away, and needing to figure out how to have him be able to live with me. I guess all of these things combined with the wish I have to have kids soon, and the anxiety around that, has made me wonder if it’s all an uphill battle that may not really be worth it in the end…)

Thanks for reading and tia for any advice you may have!! :( <3",2024-10-21 17:31:48
GradSchool,1g958jd,Question about GPA in a unique situation and how it will impact grad applications,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g958jd/question_about_gpa_in_a_unique_situation_and_how/,5,"Hello!

I recently graduated with my Bachelor's (in computer science) in May. Prior to that, in Fall '23, I got accepted to a top-25 Master's program in my field, computer science, at another university, which I was supposed to begin this fall. However, I was unable to attend due to personal reasons, so I requested an admission deferral and decided to stay and ""spend"" the interim year completing a Master's in Math at the same university that I graduated with a Bachelor's from.

Due to only having a year, my course track is quite accelerated. It is an 8-course program (plus 2 ""courses"" that are a placeholder for a Master's thesis), and I'm completing 4 courses this fall and 4 courses in the Spring, leaving the summer to finish my Math research and write my thesis. In addition to these courses, I am working on a project in Math (my main thesis project), and an almost-complete project from my undergrad that I will wrap up and publish a conference paper on before the Spring semester.

Needless to say, it is extremely hectic. On top of the number of courses and projects, I also don't have an undergraduate background in math (I did a math minor, which only prepared me for the most basic of prerequisite topics). Furthermore, math graduate courses at my university are quite objectively difficult, since their primary purpose is to prepare PhD students for their preliminary exams (as I've been told by some professors). 

I am doing reasonably well in all of my classes and am getting research done too. However, by ""reasonably well"", I mean that I am performing either average or slightly above average in all coursework. Since grade distributions are quite brutal for a couple of my courses, I am almost certain that I will not be able to maintain a perfect 4.0 GPA as I did in my undergrad.

This is quite upsetting to me. I estimate that my GPA at the end of this semester will be 3.6-3.8 (with 3.9 being an incredible feat, only even plausible if I somewhat neglect my research).

I want to reapply for grad school this Fall, since I believe I have accomplished significantly more than what I had the previous Fall. In any case, I still have the top-25 Master's program as a ""backup"". Since my current university is not that academically well-regarded (only a top 100 public university), I am extremely worried that this GPA will affect my graduate applications.

That being said, there is no doubt that I am learning an immense amount, far more than I have ever learned in my semesters in my undergraduate. This is very satisfying and is literally the reason I decided to do a Math Master's in the first place. However, as I said before, my enjoyment is being tainted by the fact that I may not be able to keep my GPA 3.9-4.0. A high GPA is, from what I've been told, *absolutely necessary* because I am not applying from a very well-regarded institution.

I am planning on targeting top-tier grad programs in my field. My questions are as follows:

1. How much will, worst-case, a 3.6 GPA impact my graduate applications this cycle?

2. When my application is reviewed, will there be any consideration of the difficulty of courses at my school?

3. Will there be any consideration of my mindset of trying to learn and ""dip my toes in"" to something I have never done before? Math is not my area of expertise at all, and my GPA will reflect this.

  
Some people have advised me to spread out my course load a bit more, because ""without a 4.0, it will be very difficult to be admitted to a top grad program"". The main reason I don't want to spread out my courses more is because I am far more eager to begin graduate research in computer science than continue taking courses in Math (which I was supposed to take as a CS grad student anyway).

I just wanted to know your guys' thoughts on the matter. How much will GPA matter in getting into a top school? Will reviewers consider my situation, especially my reasons for doing the Math Master's, or will they mainly look at my GPA? Should I really spread out my courses a bit more, which I sincerely do *not* want to do?

Thank you all in advance!",2024-10-22 00:26:41

Hello all! 
So I am applying for graduate school atm. I’m currently at KU. I am planning on doing social psych for grad school. I’m working with a professor right now for applications and he said I should find professors I share interests with in research, and I agree. But, while I don’t share interests on research topics with this professor, I feel like we are on the same page and he would be extremely good for me as a mentor. I have until December 1 to apply… I wasn’t planning on going to KU for my masters but honestly it would be just so easy to spend two more years here and then move somewhere else for my PhD. I didn’t realize how under prepared I was for graduate school until now and I think going to KU for my masters would benefit me a lot in terms of developing my research skills more and forming connections. Or at least giving me the time to form connections outside of KU. I’m basically asking: Should I apply to work with this professor even though we don’t share interests in specific research areas? I know he would be interested in my research areas if I pursued them but he wouldn’t pursue them himself, he even mentioned they kinda force him to stay in his own box. I have a lot of support at KU and I know even my sociology department would be thrilled to see me stay even though I wouldn’t be with them anymore. Let me know y’all’s thoughts. Also we are kinda homies lowkey now, same w this other professor in the social psych department. 
TLDR: Should I apply to work with this professor even though we don’t share interests in specific research areas? ",2024-10-22 15:14:40

I unfortunately started undergrad at the start of the Juul craze (if Juul was never invented, I more than likely would’ve never started vaping). I became addicted and now here we are, about 7 years later and I’m incredibly addicted to nicotine. 

It is easily one of my biggest insecurities, and now that I’m in grad school among other very educated individuals, I’m even more embarrassed. It’s something I strive to hide, but as I’m becoming closer with my cohort, it’s so challenging. It’s very frustrating to go out for drinks and feel like I’m constantly thinking about how I can’t hit my vape. I am mortified by it, as I know it’s a disgusting, unhealthy habit, but it has felt impossible to quit…

It sucks because I know I’m incredibly good at what I’m in grad school for and I get along so well with everyone, but I just feel this big insecurity cloud hanging over me, making me feel like I’m less than.

I’m just so sick and tired of this feeling…anxiety over being in situations where I can’t feed my addiction…. But not enough to quit!

**Background:** 

* (Dec 2022) Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, T10 school 
* (Feb 2023 - Present) SWE in research team, focus on AI systems & memory 
   * 1 patent, 2 conference demos, 3 *in-progress* papers (1-2Q 2025 submission), 2 industry-academia collab, 1 national lab collab 
* (In school) 2 SWE internships in research, 1 undergrad research (*no* paper), side projects & student org lead roles
* Misc, but in case relevant: International student, 25 YO, female 

**Targeted application:**

* Computer Science Master's, Fall 2025 admission (application deadline \~Dec 2024)
* 3 letters of recommendation (2 work managers (PhD), 1 professor) 

**Concerns/Questions:**

1. By Fall 2025 deadline, all of my papers will be in-progress not yet published. Officially, I will be applying to master's with 0 paper. Would this be worth a shot, or would waiting for publications and applying for Spring 2026 be a better option? 
2. Is it realistically viable to apply for Fall 2025, and if rejected, apply again for Spring 2026 with new paper publication updates? If anyone has done this, please share advice. 

I understand concerns might sound ""obvious"" without context. My time in US is limited due to student visa, hence I'm trying to expedite processes ASAP.. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, and best of luck to all fellow applicants!

I accepted an assistantship on campus at the learning center, an academic resource that offers tutoring and supplemental instruction. I had spent the previous year working at my campus writing center, and I had a great experience doing so. I was excited to accept what I thought would be a similar job: helping students. 

Upon getting there I realized that my duties would be a bit different than what I had thought. I don’t really tutor any students, I’m mostly an administrative assistant. In the beginning, it was a little disappointing as there was not much for me to do, and I didn’t feel like I was getting good experience. I was a bit upset about it, but I was willing to stick it out since I signed the contract. 

The real issue: They hired a new full-time tutoring coordinator who has made it her mission to micromanage me every minute I am there. When I got brought in, they gave me an office. When they hired her, they gave her an office. She then moved all of her stuff into my office so that she is constantly with me. She will make sure that every single minute I am there, I am doing something for her even if she has to make up work for me to do. She has referred to me (jokingly I guess) as the “slave”, and she has pressured me into working during days that everyone else is off (just to get on a zoom call with her and go over tutor training materials). 

I know I probably sound lazy, but other people have also noticed how overbearing this person can be, particularly towards me. I understand that I signed a contract, and I’m responsible for the work this office asks of me; but at the same time I’m having nightmares about the 10 hours a week I have to be there and at this point would rather break the contract halfway through the semester than continue working there.

I’m looking for advice, but would like to remain anonymity, so forgive me if I am vague. I will try and provide relevant information. 

24F, graduated with research experience and 4.0 GPA and teaching experience

2 years ago, I applied for Ph.D. programs (in STEM - biochemistry), and I also applied for an ETA (English teaching assistant) Fulbright grant in Korea (specifically intending to teach at a STEM high school). As I had always wanted to study abroad but was prohibited due to COVID, I was able to defer my enrollment in the Ph.D. program (for 2 years, which is not typical and was very generous), in order to complete 1 year in the Fulbright program. 

I originally intended to go back at start my program in Fall of 2025. However, Fulbright Korea allows you to extend your grant by an additional year—and I’ve really fallen in love with my time teaching here. I still want to do my Ph.D. as I enjoy research and also miss my time in STEM, but I’m also not married to the Ph.D. program that deferred for my (though I’m greatly appreciative of them). 

So, here’s my question. If I dropped the Ph.D. program to do another year of Fulbright in the STEM high school (but teaching English), would that be looked upon negatively by Ph.D. programs if I were to apply next year and do two years of the ETAship? Would I be totally shooting myself in the foot on getting into a good Ph.D. program if I did that? Would I be blackballing myself from academia from moving on from this program that’s deferred for me for so long? Should I just go ahead and close this chapter in Korea and move on with my professional life?

Be brutally honest. I’m open to criticism (and well deserving). Much love for reading this and helping me out! ",2024-10-20 10:06:45

I'm at the dissertation phase of my PhD, and while my works cited section gets ever larger, I still find myself drawn to doing it the ""old fashioned way""--manually citing everything, and just using traditional digital organization methods (folders, etc.) to manage article files.

It could be that it's because I'm just a freak who never in my life used citation managers or generators, even at the high school level, but I find that, counterintuitively, citation managers make me feel more disconnected from my research and makes it harder for me to keep track of everything. The Zotero connector is quite useful, but I find correcting its (relatively rare) errors frustrating and time-consuming, as opposed to manually typing out the MLA or Chicago citation (depending on the need). It could  be that I'm a Scrivener user for pretty much all my academic drafting work, and no citation manager really plays nice with Scrivener in a deep integration way (except EndNote, I've heard, but I refuse to pay that much money for software that everyone complains is finnicky and complicated). It could be that because my field uses MLA mostly, citations are much more dynamic because of their indexing to pages, not just Author-Date. It could also be that, I'll be honest, there is a soothing/calming effect to entering in the entry in the Works Cited page.

The only occasions where using a manager seems like it would be really useful, which I admit, are if I remember reading an article from years ago at the start of my PhD that I want to cite, or if I write my dissertation in MLA and the eventual manuscript it becomes needs to be in Chicago--going in and changing every in-text citation being a slog and risking missing one. These are genuine benefits, I grant. But I find that, whether I'm too stupid or tech illiterate I'm not sure, I can't figure out how to use a manager in a way that would help automate that process--at least not in a way that wouldn't require me to do proofreading afterward anyway.

Does anyone else still cite manually? Is figuring out a manager *really* something I should do? I feel like I wasted a day of working time just trying to update Zotero with the current citations I have in my diss.",2024-10-19 02:45:27

GradSchool,1g6wh1c,How do you manage your time?,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g6wh1c/how_do_you_manage_your_time/,17,"I’m a masters student in STEM and I work 8-5 (research lab) and I go to school at the same institution so work has allowed me to attend classes as long as my work is not affected. Sometimes I would stay at work till 6-7 to finish off. Classes are 4 days a week, usually 3-4 hours, and from 9-3 on thursday. We have a discussion every thursday (like a graded journal club) and a midterm every wedensday and presentations/assignments occasionally. 

Presentations and assignments take me all day, I just spent like 4 hours on an assignment and it’s not completed yet. And I don’t have time to test prep with all the assignments due dates. I tried to try and do some school related stuff when I’m at work but it’s not possible. And I am sleep deprived now. 

Can anyone help me manage my time? Should my priorities during the weekends be for the test or for the assignments? Due dates are close to each other so basically cannot categorise them according to due dates. ",2024-10-19 00:07:17

It was a great experience, but I burnt out--I came from a low-income background and was put off by a lot of my wealthy peers. I've had an interesting and meaningful career in non-profits so far and decided to get an MPA to move up in the ranks quicker. The program I chose is affordable and flexible, but not at all prestigious. At the same time my chosen field is not particularly high paid until you get into director roles. I couldn't justify the cost (which I'm footing), relocation for a scholarship, or stress of another status-obsessed school. Still, I sometimes feel like I made a poor decision. Will the lack of a name brand on my grad degree hurt my future job prospects?

GradSchool,1g7bznu,Considering Switching from Ed.D. to Ed.S. – Need Advice from Fellow Doctoral Candidates,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g7bznu/considering_switching_from_edd_to_eds_need_advice/,0,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently enrolled in an Ed.D. program, but I’ve been reflecting on my career goals and wondering if an **Ed.S. (Education Specialist)** might be a better fit for me. I’m not particularly interested in research-heavy or dissertation work, and I lean more towards the **practical application of education**—focusing on instructional leadership and improving practices within K-12 or higher education settings.

A bit about me:

* I’ve worked with diverse student populations both in the U.S. and internationally.
* My experience spans K-12 education, higher education, and remote teaching.
* I’m currently involved in various teaching roles and love the **practice** of education rather than research.
* The flexibility of an online program is crucial for me, and I want to focus more on **leadership roles** within education without the dissertation requirement.

For those who have made this switch or are currently pursuing an Ed.S., I’d love to hear your experiences. How has the transition been? Do you feel the Ed.S. has limited or expanded your career opportunities compared to an Ed.D.? Any advice for someone in my position?

Thanks in advance!",2024-10-19 15:56:57

i’ll start: jfc what an absolute bear of an application. i think i revised both my statements at least a hundred times before i could submit something i was rather proud of. i put a lot of hours into preparing this application & it’ll definitely sting if i don’t even get HM. but from reading all the past threads about the review process, it does seem like at some point, getting awarded is up to luck. and that if we don’t get it, we still accomplished something by submitting an app & it doesn’t mean we weren’t deserving! my silver lining is i ended up writing a pretty decent personal statement that i fully intend to recycle for my PhD applications this cycle (i’m a Level 1 GRFP applicant) LOL.

I'm not sure whether to include this in my publications. Could including this paper cast the rest of my application in a negative light?

GradSchool,1g6wh4c,what to do after a PhD interview?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1g6wh4c/what_to_do_after_a_phd_interview/,0,"what to do after a PhD interview?

hey guys i just wanted to ask a bit of a general question about what i should do after an interview with a professor for a PhD program (US). 

this is a program in the biomedical sciences and one where there’s no rotations, you just need to connect with a professor and hopefully stand out enough that they accept you directly to their lab. this lab is pretty much my top choice cause i have background in the techniques used and would like to continue in that direction for PhD.

the interview maybe wasn’t completely horrible but i think it also didn’t go well. i feel like i let him take the lead and speak the large majority of the time. i like to listen and was taking notes, but struggled to come up with things to say as a response to so much info. i also barely talked about my own research and feel like that was a definite error. i also think the questions i asked were stupid, but he answered a lot of my pre planned questions already. i feel like i did make it clear i would be a good fit with his mentoring style but i think that was the only positive. in his email before the interview he also said we could discuss steps for my application but during the interview he didn’t really unless i asked directly. i am probably overthinking this a lot, but it’s just my gut feeling that it didn’t go well.

anyway, i was just wondering what i should say in the follow-up email. would it be appropriate to just candidly say something like “hey, didn’t think i got my own research across well in the interview, here’s a poster i made in case you want more background” (in a more formal tone obviously lol). i don’t want to come across as needy but i also don’t really know what to expect when it comes to these interviews. like if they like you does the professor say that? i don’t know. this was my first interview. any advice or help is really appreciated :) 

tldr: kinda fumbled the bag on my first phd interview with my top choice by not really getting across my research background and interests and not asking good questions - is there anything i can do in the follow-up email to make it a little better? is it appropriate to attach a poster i did?",2024-10-19 00:07:24

I help with my lab's recruitment every year, and we keep getting students who are interested in (and end up joining or at least trying to join) our lab who are menaces to me and my coworkers during recruitment. I understand social anxiety and nerves; that's not what I'm talking about. Don't be rude. A lot of professors, mine included, will ask their students what they thought of you when they met you. I do actually tell my boss about the time someone told me that our research field was a sham (ok, why try to join, then?) or the time someone ignored both me and my coworker completely in our efforts to greet them but suddenly came to life when my professor walked into the room, as if we weren't worth their time. Students who my professor has been interested in have been turned down because she heard how nasty they were to us. And if you do still end up getting into the lab despite these things, you've started off on a really bad foot with your new coworkers.

So I strongly advise anyone trying to get into a lab to put their best foot forward with *everyone*, not just the PI. It does actually matter, and this can start as early as recruitment weekends.",2024-10-14 16:41:27
