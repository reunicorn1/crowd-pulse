What the heck kind of jobs do I even qualify for at this point? ,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq544u/failed_out_of_office_work_and_did_uber_eats_for_5/,7,"I have had an odd path. I have a BBA double majoring in finance and economics, with about a year of combined lending/banking experience if you count internships. I then got a MS in Management, but it was very HR-centric and all the companies that recruited from it were only for HR roles. I thought it would compliment my BBA and give me a MBA type profile. Anyway, I had to do a graduate internship during the MS, so I also have internship experience in HR compensation. After graduating I got tons of recruiter calls for HR rolls, which I ultimately humored as I was beginning to feel desperate. I interviewed with a lot of places, but I just didn't really feel like a good personality fit. Granted, my self confidence was extremely low at that point, so I was just kind of weird guy to deal with.

Later I got reached out to on Linkedin by a guy with a financial planning/life insurance firm, where they would sponsor me getting a Series 7 and 55. I thought I might try to break into the investment analysis world by starting in sales. It turned out to be a huge disaster, but I did that job for 7 months. Those certifications are now expired.

Anyway, I kind of just gave up and started doing Uber Eats and other apps. I went hardcore mode and made over $30 an hour, but I felt like a loser and never considered attempting to date anyone. I did that for about 3 years, when I just one day had had enough and moved back to my home town. I luckily have a lot of savings and parents who help with bills, so am not really under financial stress, but I really want to give dating another shot before I get too old (turning 33 this month).

Other notes: my body is starting to get shitty and my family has a history of hernias so I don't need to be doing manual labor stuff anymore. Also, I am getting surgery to remove my man boobs - something that really ruined my ability to be relaxed and affable around others.

Big question: am I only qualified for entry level roles? How does my resume read to someone from the outside looking in? I worry it comes across as someone who can't commit to something and/or emotional instability. ",2024-11-13 04:47:58
careerguidance,1gq5are,30 with no high school diploma. What should I do? ,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq5are/30_with_no_high_school_diploma_what_should_i_do/,15,"Hey guys, 

I’m at a crossroads with what I want to do/what is the right move for me. I just turned 30 and never graduated high school. I’ve had some pretty decent jobs. My last job was an operations manager for a construction materials company running one of the many branches and I am now an equipment manager at a welding/pipe fitting company. 

I make pretty good money and have it pretty good at my current job. But, I feel poorly about myself for never graduating. I think I’m going to do online at nights and get that done regardless just for my own ego, it definitely bothers me. 

I’m limited to how far I can go currently because of severe mental health problems (anxiety) that I’ve been dealing with so it limits my options a lot in that regard. 

But I can’t help but wonder, I’ve gotten by just fine without a diploma thus far and I’d like to think I’m quite intelligent and I’m someone who loves learning and took it upon myself to learn a lot and learn a lot of different skills. I’m a big people person, good with computers and excelled in management roles. 

My only worry is that if this company goes under or I get fired, would it be reasonable to stay on the path I am in management with all of my experience and work my way up the ladder at companies I may work for in the future. 

Or should I go back to school and get my diploma and try to get a piece of paper regardless? 

I know this is so generalized and hard to say really. But I guess I just feel like I don’t deserve to be where I am and making the money I am. And if something should happen to my job, it will limit me even with all my experience as far as me not even being able to find work if this suddenly ends. 

I would ideally want to go to school and finish my high school and then go into some trades, as it’s the only way I see myself going to school for four years and making enough to live on. (I also have a young son) however I would much rather stay up in the office and make the money I am now as I make just as much or slightly less than the guys with their red seals. 

I think I just need some other peoples thoughts as I’m struggling with wrapping my head around what the right decision is and I’m kind of all over the place (in case you haven’t noticed) 

Thanks. ",2024-11-13 04:59:04

""so why aren't you a travel guide?"" ""why would you study that?"" etc. For some reason people don't seem to grasp that my studies included courses in business, law, accounting, marketing etc. and not dishwashing.

For me, the facination towards tourism has always been about understanding how travel affects people and the world. I’m especially interested in the sustainability aspects and the work of international organizations like UNWTO, European Travel Commission, World Travel & Tourism Council, Global Tourism Forum etc., and I'm considering a master’s in corporate sustainability. But whenever I’ve brought up the possibility of pursuing a master's the reactions have been like ""are you sure you’re qualified?"" or ""would they even accept you?""

Or I suppose the people making those comments have all been from my home country. I currently live abroad and here everyone I've mentioned it to has been been very supportive. But back home, there’s a strong bias favoring ""scientific"" degrees over ""practical"" ones, and tourism is viewed as pretty much bottom-tier. I've made up my mind to apply for the master's next year but I don't think I'll tell anyone. At least I'll avoid all the told-you-so's if I don't get in. Have any of you experienced anything similar?

They were really supportive while I was in school—they were flexible with my hours, and they even gave me a promotion when I graduated. 
Since then, I’ve had several pay raises and taken on new responsibilities, but I’ve never actually had a title change. Right now, I’m doing purchasing along with a handful of other roles that are sort of loosely defined.

Here’s the dilemma: as time goes on, I’m starting to notice a big gap in talent and competence among my coworkers. Some of them are nice enough people, but I keep finding myself frustrated by the lack of professionalism and skill. Im not having to work harder because of it. I take care of my stuff and help when asked for their work. But that's just the problem. No one is helping me grow. (With that said, I will always learn. But I’m worried I might be limiting my own growth by staying here long-term.

I know loyalty matters, and this company has helped me out. But is it a bad reason to consider leaving just because I’m not surrounded by the kind of talent or high standards that could push me forward? I don’t want to come off as arrogant, but I feel like I might be holding myself back. Would love to hear if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what you’d suggest.

Edit - to the people saying that people that think others are dumb are often dumb too: I get it but whether I'm dumb or not is really not the point. It's the fact that I'm not getting any smarter in relation to my career around the people I work with. 

To the people saying I should help others get better and get a promotion. I am - and I will. However even if I get a promotion and I rise to meet the new responsibilities it doesn't mean I'm growing at the pace to stay competitive in the industry. ",2024-11-12 19:05:32

When asked where I live, I mentioned a particular street, which isn't entirely a lie but definitely omits much of the truth. I did this because I'm concerned that my living situation could negatively influence their opinion of me, especially in the early stages. I feel that how I live should play no part in my validity as a candidate, as long as I show up every day and am able to work effectively.

However, if I get this job, I wouldn't feel comfortable continuing this lie, especially with colleagues. Should I explicitly mention my living circumstances tomorrow, be truthful if asked again, or, if offered the job, disclose it at that point? Any other advice is highly appreciated.

For context, my industry is IT, and the job is hybrid (2 days in the office, 3 days remote), but I plan to go into the office every day. I do have the electricity and internet to work from my van if needed. If I get this job, or any other, I will continue to live in my van.

Edit:

Thank you everyone for the responses. The overwhelming response is to not disclose this. If asked I will continue to be vague about my living circumstances.

I’m a general dentist and live a comfortable life with my wife (no kids), both age 33.

I started working as a general dentist about 6 years ago and over time, picked up the ability of doing surgery efficiently. Out of every type of procedure there is, it’s what I most enjoy doing (and what I’m best at). I thought it’d maybe make sense focusing on surgery since it’s what I’m best at. I’ve grown to dislike doing any procedure that’s not surgery. 

So, naturally, the idea of applying to a surgery residency has crossed my mind. However, these are 4 to 6 year programs. IMO, that’s a long time and 30’s are typically the time when one starts thinking about (or already have started) families. Which my wife and I have sometimes discussed. 

If I pursue residency, it’d also mean my wife and I would likely be apart for 4-6 years as well, considering she has her own profession/job.

If I get accepted to a program and become a surgeon, I’d be able to comfortably 2-3x my salary at minimum. 

Money is not everything to me, and I am living comfortably atm, but this is something to consider if I’m trying to set myself up for retirement faster. The immediate downside is being separated from my wife, not being able to start a family now (not until almost 40?), loss of income for 4 years, etc…

I’m looking for some guidance on a career crossroads I’m at.

Right now, I have a comfortable job as a copywriter in a big company in Germany. It’s well-paid, comes with nice perks, and the work-life balance is solid. My colleagues are nice enough, though we don’t have a strong connection. The company itself is nice too—beautiful office space, good benefits, etc.—but my role has become extremely repetitive, with little challenge or room for advancement.

The problem is, I’m aiming to transition into roles with more responsibility and growth potential, specifically in e-commerce or SEO management (where I have a bit of experience).

I’ve been applying to positions, but these fields are highly competitive, and I’m struggling to get hired for roles that are a step up, as most employers just see my experience as limited to copywriting. My managers are aware of my situation, but their advice is essentially to “stay patient” and keep looking, since the market is tough right now.

Additionally, I’m living in Germany, but I don’t speak the language fluently, which makes it harder to feel fully integrated, and I’m honestly starting to feel a bit restless here.

I’m not in an urgent rush, but I expected this job search to go more smoothly. The longer it takes, the more frustrated I’m getting, both with my current role and with the job market.

Does anyone have advice on how I can navigate this situation? Should I consider taking other intermediate steps, upskilling, or perhaps looking in a different direction? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",2024-11-13 10:58:47

Just need to vent and get some advice.

I've just started a new position two weeks ago, after having my contract ended at my previous employer. Last year, I was also fulfilling a voluntary board position as president at a youth organization to which I've devoted a lot of time - also during work hours. As a result, my performance in the job wasn't great (to put it mildly). In the last few months of the job, the time which I had to improve my performance, I fell ill and couldn't do the right work to get my contract renewed, unfortunately.

Now that I'm in my new job, I miss my old job a lot. I miss the office, the activities the company organized, some of my workmates, and also the content of the work. I really need some time getting used to my new job. Also, it's a temporary position with only a slight chance of staying there longer term, depending on whether anyone in the department moves into a new role. So I am not in a very secure position right now, and I wish I had worked in my previous role to stay there for a permanent contract.

I constantly feel stupid about spending so much time on the board of the youth organization, and I really wish I could go back to my old job. However, there's no possibility of reaching out to my previous workplace as they have terminated the contract.

Can anyone give me some advice on how to move on from this? Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation, missing their old job and finding it hard to focus on the new one?",2024-11-13 09:02:49

The jobs Ive had my first job was a kitchen hand, as well as retail for Big W. Then I started an apprenticeship in cooking at 18, I did that for 3 years and realised it was not for me, so went back to school as a mature aged student at UNI, completed a degree in ARTs majoring in Political science and Sociology. Tried to do business and Law but half way through developed a mental illness, at 23 was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Living without money and a place to live at the time, my father took pity on me and offered me a place to live with him in a two bedroom house that he had been offered by the department of housing on a rental basis. I might add that my mum and dad had separated previously and my dad gave his wife the house and left with very little.

I lived with my Dad for 20 years he was on the pension until he passed away at the age of 92 in 2019. In the 20 years my Dad acquired an inheritance from his Step mother and in turn he was able to purchase the house we were renting from Dep of Housing. He also put my name with his name on the title, so when he passed away it was transferred to me.

At the start of being mentally ill, it took me some time to come to grips with. Medication and with some help I was able to get back into employment such as working as a store man for a year, I then drove buses for two years. I then got a job with the APS as a customer service adviser which I worked for 4 years. I left for whatever reasons and then drove buses again for another 7 years.

Should I Give Up and Pivot to Another Industry or Get a New Degree?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq7dgn/career_in_tv_post_production_but_havent_had_work/,0,"I (28m) have been working as an Assistant Editor for TV (largely reality shows) since 2021. I went to school for film and have wanted to work in entertainment since I was a child. I tried starter jobs in other fields when I graduated in 2019, but I was miserable at nearly all of them and only really found satisfaction working in TV. On top of that, I also have a passion for Voiceover and have been taking classes for it for years 

The job market in entertainment has been absolutely abysmal since the strikes last year. Everyone I know in post hasn’t been working in months (unless they’ve been fortunate enough to be  working at post houses, which also have very few open spots), and I haven’t been able to find work since October of last year. I’ve been applying to everything I can and reaching out to my network as best I can, but still haven’t had any luck. I’ve been burning through my savings all year and haven’t put any time at all into Voiceover the past 6 months due to feeling I need financial security before I can comfortably pursue it. Suffice to say, it’s all been distressing, dissatisfying, and demoralizing, especially as it gets closer to the holidays.

I’ve had a lot of contemplations of going back to school and getting an associates or bachelor’s in anything that could actually be marketable (business admin, communications, marketing, public relations, etc.), but the thought of it fills me with dread, to the point where I started crying while filling out an online aptitude test to determine what field to go after. Editing in entertainment is my dream career, and I don’t want to just “give up” on it. At the same time, I don’t want to wait 2-4 years to be able to start my career again in another field that could very well have similar employment issues by the time I finish my degree. I hate being unemployed. I want to be working *now*.

The way I see it for myself, the way I’m looking for work isn’t working, and I feel like I have to take 1 of 3 paths forward for how to build a career for myself:

1) Stop applying for work for the time being and focus on diversifying my skill set and building myself as a freelance editor. Make reels, a website, and market my services. This one feels the most difficult for me personally.

2) Make a Hail Mary with Voiceover and put my everything into making a career out of that instead (I already have professional reels made, I’d just need to actually devote myself to running it like a business, marketing myself, and spending all my time auditioning or promoting myself). Between all my options, this is what I see as my most ideal life, but I recognize the chance for success is slim, and I’m afraid of hitting 30 or 35 and having nothing to show for it but a failed VO career and years of time wasted in service jobs barely supporting myself.

3) Go back to school and get a more practical degree or an accreditation or any kind of qualifications for any other “safer” industry (whatever that would look like). This I recognize is probably the most practical in the long run, but again, I really don’t want to wait until my 30s for my career to actually begin, and I fear that by the time I get something that looks good on a resume, that field will also be so hyper-competitive that I won’t have a shot in it either. I don’t want to hit 35 and have nothing to show for it but 2 useless degrees.

Basically, I’m looking for feedback and advice on what to do. I feel like I need to pick *one* of these paths sooner rather than later, but none of them feel right to me, and the ones that do I fear will be the wrong choice long-term. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

So TL;DR - I work in Post, the job market has been god-awful, and I haven’t worked in over a year and feel miserable. Do I keep pushing forward with a new approach, devote myself to my dream passion with Voiceover (at the risk of running out of money), or go back to school and/or pivot to a new industry entirely, even if it won’t make me happy?",2024-11-13 07:14:35

* I enjoy thinking about complex social issues - right now I am potentially interested in studying agrecology at a masters level since it intersects with development, economics, social science and the environment. However it seems that at a professional level most humanities careers end up in the office for most of the day - which I do not want. I am not even sure if agroecology is a viable position or field since it seems relatively newer
* I love being outdoors, whether that is walking, hiking, swimming, snorkelling, biking, etc. I also have a love for travelling and exploring new places, cultures and meeting new people!
* I am considering going back to school and doing a Bachelor of Science or alternatively, a Env. Tech diploma so that I could find a gov related or non profit job in surveying and fieldwork in the wildlife and fishiers sector (but I don't want a job just driving around the city and testing water quality in wells for private companies which seems like this is what it leads to?)

Basically, I have a few ideas on what I could potentially do but I really have no idea what would be right for me and I am anxious about committing to something and investing more time, effort and money if I will come out on the other side again with theoretical knowledge and education but pretty unemployable again and not a special or practical skillset. I really value working at a job that aligns with my ethics and morals, because I do not think I could do a job everyday that goes against these things.

Any advice appreciated!

Hello! I got my B.S. in psychology with a minor in biology, then got my Master's in Higher Education Administration. I've worked for a few months now as an academic advisor at a university, but I'm already thinking I want to change my career. I was originally a biology major on pre-med track, but switched when Covid hit because my mental health declined horribly and I thought I would like advising more. I'm not loving it as much as I thought, especially because I get told at least once a week that I'm too smart for this job, which I'm starting to feel may be true because I'm bored and missing having a bit of challenge at work. I did a lot of the hard stuff already (organic chemistry, calculus, physics, etc.), and was going to take medical terminology and anatomy/physiology in the spring since I can take classes for free at the university I work at. The thing is, I'm not sure what I want to move to. I make about $54k right now and don't see many avenues for really increasing that in my field, which worries me as I feel like that isn't going to work long-term. I looked at Anesthesiology Assistant school, but it is an INTENSE program that I'm not sure I could handle. I had a 3.96 for undergraduate and I think I could get into a variety of programs with all of my prerequisite courses, but I'm trying to find a balance between something that is manageable and something that gives me the opportunity to make more money and have more job stability. As I said, I do like some challenge, but CAA school requires 60 hour weeks, out of state rotations, etc. I'm not really looking at something like medical school or pharmacy school either that will take 4 years. I looked at radiology tech programs since I have a majority of the classes (outside of the radiology specific ones), but the pay doesn't seem any greater. Any ideas?",2024-11-13 05:48:22

I have been working as an executive assistant for the last 8 years and feel that it's time to move on, but I'm not exactly sure where my next step should be. My background is in music, and have spent my career up until this point moving between EA roles at companies in various sectors. Most recently, I have spent the last two years as an EA to CEO at a small (but notable and well connected) design firm. I would like to take a step into a more creative role, preferably in the arts/creative/design spaces but in a year of searching on and off I haven't been able to get any interest in my Project Manager or Creative Director applications. Or other Executive Assistant applications, for that matter.

I think part of the issue is that my degrees are not in art, they're in music. I think I'm simply getting out-competed by the people who have more specialized backgrounds or simply more experience for the roles, which I understand. And I also don't think that anyone wants an MA for an assistant, which I also understand.

Where can I go from here? I want to take the next step but am simply not sure what to do next. I just want to be *doing* something. I've dabbled in a few valuable skills since grad school that may be helpful - I know some Python, HTML/CSS (unfortunately not Javascript too - but that's next), and have been working on an actual visual arts practice.

The job was fine, but his real interest was in graphic design, something he had done for fun but never professionally. During the pandemic, he decided to give freelancing a shot, thinking it could be a great way to bring in some extra cash and finally work on projects he cared about. His plan was simple: keep his day job, pick up design clients on the side, and see where it went.

At first, the side hustle was exciting. He’d land a small project, work on it in the evenings, and earn a bit of money on top of his main salary. But soon, the projects started to stack up. Alex found himself saying “yes” to more and more clients, staying up past midnight to hit deadlines, and feeling tired every morning. Weekends? Those became workdays too. Managing clients, keeping up with his customer support job, and finding time for himself all became a huge balancing act.

Then, burnout hit. Hard. He started to question if the side hustle was worth it, especially when it was impacting his energy and job performance. But here’s where the story takes a turn: his hard work didn’t go unnoticed. Over time, his growing design portfolio and the skills he’d built on the side led to a big opportunity. A company noticed his freelance work, reached out, and eventually hired him for a full-time design role. Alex was able to leave customer support and transition fully into a job he genuinely enjoyed.

Side hustles can be rewarding, but they’re also demanding and sometimes overwhelming.

I've heard through the vine that Dec '25 will be the end of the contract and even though we are still desirable, there is no certainty and even if so, it'd probably be a badge flip thing which adds a bunch of new concerns.

So the other day a friend who works at a place I previously worked reached out to me saying they have the manager position for what I do opening and that I should apply and name him as a reference. He's pretty high up in his separate department and I have other connections there as well. While it is something I day dreamed of in the past, now that it's a real possibility, I am having second thoughts.

My life is way different from 8 years ago when I left. I started the riskier job before I had kids and I left the other place because I was worried of being stuck there forever and not being challenged. Now I have the potential opportunity to go back and run things my way, take what I've learned and transform that place but at the same time...if I could know my current position was as safe as this one, I would definitely stay.

So basically I have to decide on a risky, best case job, with amazing co-workers, interesting subject matter, and relaxed management vs. going back to an in office, 9-5+, managing role that is safe.

Compensations is similar. My new current salary (just promoted) is the base for the others listed.

With no campus placements, I studied even harder, and eventually, I landed a job with the first company I interviewed for.

I’m currently working as an embedded developer, but unfortunately, there’s no real development work happening here.

I received a job offer from another department within my company. I’ve been in my current position for two and a half years, and I'm starting to feel tired of it.

When I get to do work I enjoy, it’s rewarding, but there’s often a lot of unnecessary drama with coworkers. It also feels like a dead-end role, without much room for growth.

The new department offers more overtime and a possible pay increase of one dollar per hour. While access to overtime is appealing, the work seems more strenuous than the raise would justify. I had also considered going back to school (although that’s not set in stone), so I’m unsure if more mandatory overtime would be worth it.

I tend to feel a lot of apprehension around major decisions, which is why I could use some advice. My current role provides some enjoyment, but the ongoing drama makes me wish I could work somewhere else. I’m not particularly passionate about the new position; to me, it’s just another job.

The main appeal of switching departments is simply that it’s not my current role, which has become vague and frustrating. However, I’m concerned that if I take this new position without a real interest in it, I might struggle to adapt in the long run and end up feeling worse.

I feel conflicted about joining a new department just to escape my current one, especially since I’m not genuinely interested in the work there. It’s not that I couldn’t do the work—I just don’t feel any real connection to it. 0 passion 

In my current role, there are parts I enjoy and would love to focus on, but the position is so vague that I’m constantly pulled into other projects. I’ve spoken with my manager about it, but he can’t provide the static role I’m looking for—maybe in a year or so, he said, but no guarantees.

I’ve spent nearly a decade in the U.S., but due to visa issues (my company couldn’t sponsor me), I had to return to my home country. Now, after 5 months of job hunting, I’m struggling to find work, and adjusting to the work culture here has been tough, especially since it feels quite different from the U.S.



I currently have about $100k in savings, but the job market here for design roles seems limited, and I’ve realized that positions in design systems (which I’m targeting) are undervalued and underpaid in my home country. On the other hand, I’m considering going back to the U.S. for grad school in design systems or a related field. The downside is that going back to school would eat into most of my savings, and there’s always the uncertainty around the H1-B visa process and securing a job after graduation.



So here’s the big question: Should I invest in grad school to specialize in design systems and hope things work out, or should I conserve my savings, continue looking for a job, and try to break into the field through hands-on experience? I’m 28 and don’t have much time to waste, but I also don’t want to end up making a decision that’ll set me back.



Has anyone been in a similar situation, particularly if you were transitioning into a specialized field like design systems? How did you weigh the pros and cons of grad school versus job hunting in uncertain times? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

I’m having a hard time telling my boss since he was so good to me when I was going through this relocation. I was going to give a 3 week notice, considering thanksgiving & hoping to clear my workload for the rest of the year so it doesn’t fall on anyone else. ",2024-11-13 04:23:36

I've been in the restaurant industry for almost a decade now. Made my way to general manager and found out I do not care to be doing this for the rest of my life. I'm looking to finally use my degree in criminology to pivot into fraud investigations now.

There is a fraud convention conference happening tomorrow and I asked them to open additional slots so i can pay for registration. I'm at the registration now and they are asking for my company and title but I obviously have no ties to the field. 

That started to make me think if there is truly a point here. Sure I'll learn something new and basic but are there actual opportunities to make meaningful networks when I offer nothing since i have no experience at all? I'm going in with the thought that maybe I can meet some hiring manager and pray that it'll start the convo of me getting a chance to get my foot in the door but I'm not too sure now. The conference seems to only be catered to experienced people rather than anyone who's interested in coming.

  
Should I just pay and see what the day brings about? Any insight would be appreciated!",2024-11-13 04:16:32

I’m from a country with very limited opportunities. I work as a VA, HR, and PA, and I also handle some operations work for a startup that helps Australian businesses outsource from my country. 

Recently, I realized I don’t see a future or growth opportunities in this company. The pay is good, but since I work closely with my Managing Director, I’ve noticed he sometimes makes sexist and racist comments. I’ve been working here for over a year, and while everything seemed fine initially, the director isn’t making any effort to establish a proper company structure. Policies don’t apply to employees who have been with the company since the beginning, and during appraisals, he avoids giving constructive feedback to some just because they’ve been here a long time.

I have a bachelor’s degree in International Business Management and an MBA in Administration, and I feel like I want to do something more meaningful—a career where I can excel. I’m passionate about compliance, PR, and law, marketing, client relations but I know it may take time to find the right path. Right now, though, I feel a bit lost.",2024-11-13 04:15:10

Is there a job out there for someone like me?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq4huy/under_30_making_200k_but_hate_my_job_is_there_a/,27,"Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I think I’m having a life crisis here. I’ve always been very good at selling myself, I am in insurance sales but I hate what I do. My strengths are building relationships quickly and selling myself/my services. That said, I absolutely loathe any of the actual paperwork or attention to detail. 

Some backstory, I’ve done a bit of job hopping, starting in 2020 (I am under 30) around 30k/year. I have since moved to a new company every 12 months roughly, each time I am able to sell myself well and take a substantial income increase, my current company is paying me a base salary of over 200k before commissions. Sounds great, but the problem is I feel like I’m building a house of cards that isn’t sustainable and once they figure out my weaknesses (organization, attention to detail, properly filing paperwork) it’ll all fall apart. I don’t have a college degree. 

My question - is there any role out there with comparable salary for someone like me who excels at selling themselves (talking) and building quick/deep relationships? I’m great at the wine and dining part of the job but not so great at the rest? 

I would love to own my own agency and have some capital saved to do so, but if I’m honest with myself I just can’t see myself successfully holding that all together. I could do really well as a lead generator or something similar if I didn’t have to back it up with providing tangible quotes. 

I know I sound like a massive piece of garbage, I probably am, but I also didn’t want to sugar coat any of this in the off chance there is the miracle job out there for me to apply for. Thanks in advance, I’m already pretty down on myself so do your worst if you feel the need. ",2024-11-13 04:12:18

I've been working at my company for about 4.5 years now, and I feel like I've become super complacent and was looking for advice on how to get my work ethic back. Before this job I was always the type of person to get to work early and do all my work as I got it and ask for new work immediately. I'd get everything done on time and was a mostly straight A student in college except for a B here or there.

Now though.... I honestly just slack off a lot. My job is supposed to be 'hybrid' with one day wfh, but I honestly just do the opposite since I know no one even notices. And work is pretty sparse so I pretty much just do a few things one day a week and then just sit around waiting for emails to pile up until I have enough to make me actually feel like doing it. Don't really bother with time constraints that much anymore and I honestly havent even used my skill set at this job for over a year at this point. 

I'm a low level programmer with pretty basic skills but I barely use them anymore since most of my projects are just handed to me to so I can send them off to someone else for QA. Pay is okay for my area and I like how easy it is, but I'm wanting to move and get a fresh start as I guess I just feel bored. My work has straight up said they won't keep me if I move, as they don't want full time remote employees, so now I'm hesitating just because I know I have no work ethic anymore and when I come in, I'm always late now too. 

I'm afraid my current poor work ethic would remain while my old one stays dormant if I suddenly started a new job, and then get fired for it and be out of a job entirely. Also just feel like my programming skills have decayed with lack of use, and I'm having trouble getting myself to try and study again.",2024-11-13 03:44:11

I have:

BS: Healthcare Admin/Mgmt

EMT License: Expires early 2025

Army Medic Experience (6years)

I am also looking at going back to school for a job with Rad Tech, Sonographer, or Dental Hygienist. My biggest concerns are work/life balance and pay.

TW mention of sh,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq2kvp/i_think_my_boss_hates_me_please_help_tw_mention/,0,"Title says it basically. I'll be describing some events later, please tell me if it's just my anxiety speaking or if my boss really hates me. I have anxiety & depression and everyday I interact with my boss/supervisor, I end up crying and wanting to quit. Today was really bad, I started thinking about s\*lf ha\*rm.

A little background: I am F25, graduated 2023 with a psych. degree. I have been a case worker for 2 yrs., now I'm a coordinator for schedules. My first week of work, I did not come prepared for a meeting I was supposed to co-lead. That was my fault I didn't ask questions. I was not fully trained on it though. My supervisor talked to me after, gave me feedback about how I looked bored, unengaged, frustrated, & annoyed. She said I looked so disorganized and unprepared. She said it looked like I was waiting for my coworker to help me out I apologized and told her I didn't mean to look that way, if ever I was frustrated at myself for not knowing what to do. I told her I never actually expected my coworker to help me because I have felt so alone during the meeting. Also, that same coworker was actually the one handling my cases & I started work Mon. I had the meeting Tue to report about all my clients. My coworker asked me for updates on those clients she worked with, I would constantly say I don't know, because I really don't. I had 1.5 days to look at over 100 clients. I explained to my boss, she said thanks for your honesty. Then, I asked help from other coworkers to help me. But since then, I have felt like she did not like me. The comments/feedback she said doesn't seem to be something you tell a worker the 2nd day they're working, right? Or am I expecting too much?

Another thing, today she asked me if I did something I was supposed to do yesterday. I apologized & told her I completely forgot because I was doing other things, like the ""homework"" of looking at a specific population of clients. She said, I didn't tell you to do all of the population, just the ones you had plans for. I said I had plans for the whole population that's why it took me awhile. I asked if I can fix my problem and do what I was supposed to do yesterday, she said yes. During today's meeting, I led the whole thing. I was prepared. When I would go through each cases' summary, I would double check some info with them like other coordinators do, she would say, we talked about doing this yesterday. I was like, thank you for reminding me, just double checking. But when other coordinators would ask something that we talked about 2 mins ago because they'd say, sorry I got lost a bit--my boss would not make the same comment she made with me. Whenever she saw I didn't update my notes, she would say, okay erase that and fix this. OR, she'd say, why is this your plan and have you talked to the family about this? And I would soon realize I had not updated the note accurately. Then, my coworker would present and her notes were not updated at all but she talked about all the updates and she didn't get questioned liked me.

My boss also told me to do update a note, but then I remembered that we had a similar situation earlier and she told me to do something else. So I asked her if it's okay to update the note because from earlier, we had something similar and we did something else. She said, no that's a different scenario because this person is new and the client is new so we're not doing it for this one. She said that a matter-of-factly and I was like, okay thank you for giving me that scenario. Now I know, thank you. She never once smiled at me, only glared and questioned everything I did. I cannot deal with it, I feel like I am not cut out for corporate world but I need the money to pay my debts. I dread talking to her because she'll find something I didn't do and she'll say it's unacceptable that I have been trained for 3 weeks and worked 2 weeks and still don't know some things

I'm at a point I have joked about d\*ying to my friends because I feel life would be easier that way. I was so close to cu\*ting myself while I had a meeting with her, just to alleviate the emotional pain. I question myself everyday, whether I am doing something right or if I'm just slow and stupid. I have no confidence in doing anything because I fear she will find something wrong about it. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, & PTSD from a previous relationship. I attempted to off myself 3 yrs ago. I feel myself going downhill & need help for a backup plan because if not, I feel like sh is the answer and I do not want to go back there                        ",2024-11-13 02:30:47

I started 2 months ago & was trained by my manager and have been passed down to my supervisor. Both have told me I’m doing well, the mgr felt the need to tell the team when I was being introduced that I was doing well/caught on quickly. When I talk to my supervisor, she gives redirection/correction but has been positive the other majority of the time too. She even pointed out that she calls it like she sees it and said I don’t take compliments well 😶, I owned up to that and told her I appreciate her positive feedback. 

Well they fly out all newbies to UT for orientation & I met my supervisor at a welcome dinner. I felt uneasy when I was asking her pretty blunt role related questions (like will expectations with metrics become more strict after the probation period, trying to compare how I’m trending with other former newbies she’s trained that are no longer there). To help answer the metrics question, she brought up the 2nd newest team member before me and how he barely met metrics but it was still *good* because he’s new and it’s still technically passing. And I tried to ask in a way without sounding paranoid if mgmt was typically positive with newbies it didn’t work out with, since they’ve been reassuring with me from since my start. And she said that there were signs with those former newbies since day 30, she’d tell them that “they got this” but would still be “honest” with her concerns regarding how they’re trending with certain things. She said with me she hasn’t had that fear yet and apparently bragged about me to the other supervisor. Another time I was worried was when we were in a one-on-one and I’m assuming someone msged here on teams b/c she was looking for something & randomly blurted out “Lyn, I don’t know”. 

The other fears at the dinner were: her talking about an introverted coworker that barely talks but drew attention at a recent meeting holding a baby that she didn’t know was her nephew but mentioned she’s really good at her job, talking about an interview she had recently where there was awkward silence bc the mgr that trained me was taking notes/has slow processing time and the interviewee asked if everything was okay (but my boss mentioned she loves that mgr) & her friend/the other dept mgr at the dinner table mentioned her subordinate sending a file too soon & needing to correct her. Its just…talking about anyone in the slightest makes me nervous. But my supervisor was *nice* in person, I just feel like no one can be that nice all the time and I get sus.

Director Comments about me to other employees

Hello,

I have a question about my directors conduct, I am a disabled employee at a massive UK franchise with a chronic disability. I had some time off due to a sick note, I then came in to give said sick note to director, could not find him so I gave it to my line manager and explained why I was off.

She apparently just left this note on said directors desk with zero context, so I came in today to be told by multiple employees he was absolutely furious I apparently had left this note on his desk with zero context, stating that I have apparently no respect and communication issues. This is clearly not what happened. For context, my employment situation is tumultuous as I have had frequent doctor visits and time off due to disability and this has effected my training in said role (been there 25 months). Said director has previously made comments such as “I am not disabled” (I currently claim PIP). 

Is this an okay thing for him to say to other employees? I’m on a performance review anyway, so it’s my understanding I should just leave, but I am really not happy with his conduct, what can I do?

For reference, I’m not overly attached to the field at all, but I have been there quite a long time.",2024-11-13 02:12:46

careerguidance,1gq1x7v,Should I switch jobs?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gq1x7v/should_i_switch_jobs/,4,"Hello

Before I start, please excuse and typing errors as I am typing this from the phone.

Now to my dilemma/situation.

I recently joined a new company (Company B) from Company (A) as my manager had recently made the switch and he helped me join Company B.

Ever since I have joined, he has been pestering with stupid questions such as:

1. Is your current department head better or the one in Company A?
2. Is the manager who replaced him in Company A better than him? Whom did I like working with more?

Stuff like that kept happening.

Ever since I joined, I have felt he has a slight negative bias towards me. He kept bringing up a mistake I made in Company A almost a year ago and asked me if I kept getting scolded by the department head there after he left.

Apart from that one mistake, my department head never scolded me and I even handled pretty much my entire team’s work after my manager was gone as we were short staffed or the replacements were quite new so I had to train them as well.

After not getting the promotion in Company A I started actively hunting for new job so that I atleast get a pay increase if nothing else.

Recently I made a slight mistake wherein a couple of numbers were double counted and I had sent it for review (first level) to another Manager and he called me over the weekend and blasted me.

After the weekend, he spoke to me and asked me why such errors were being made. In his defense he has asked me to include checks in my work and revisit my work so that is fair. But its what he said afterwards that irked me a little.
He said that in Company A my department wanted to put me on PIP about 3 times but he didn’t let her (I was never told my performance was in question ever while I was there). Heck before I was leaving they were going to nominate me for quarterly awards and everyone in the team gave rave reviews about me (I have it in writing).

He then followed up with saying that he covered for my mistake with the department head in Company B and he can’t keep covering me.

To give a background about my Manager in company A. He didn’t get along with another Manager or his peers who sat next to him. His attitude forced one team member to switch teams as she couldn’t handle working with him. Our stakeholders were complaining on how the budget cycle was handled by him and the department head.

I never got a negative feedback from any of my stakeholders in Company A so I am wondering if I am doing something incorrect or if he has no room for human error in his review process.

It has been less than 2 months in Company B and I am already quite burnt out and demotivated.

Should I be looking for other jobs?

that being said, ive been considering other career paths with seemingly better career stability/prospects and values more aligned with mine and ive been considering healthcare, specifically nursing. it would be challenging to study for sure especially since its been awhile since i took advanced stem classes, but i can envision myself working in this field long term and dont mind continuing health education as it does interest me. i like the diverse specialties, possibility of flexibility with travel nursing and 3 12s and more. having direct impact on humans and working on my feet/with my hands quickly also has been stimulating to me. even my parents are also supportive of me going back to school for this, so im strongly leaning towards starting this new journey this coming year by fulfilling pre nursing reqs first.

i dont think theres ever a ""perfect"" job and i dont think ill ever be fully satisfied, but with who i am as a person now and what i want my future to look like, for sum reason going into healthcare piques my interest.

feeling lost, but also trying to stay open for whats in store :') would love to hear anyone else's thoughts, and maybe even experiences in healthcare specifically nursing!",2024-11-13 01:42:35

On the other side, I’ve studied software development (especially full-stack and front-end), and I have about 2 years of experience in front-end development. I genuinely love coding and building things, and software is where I really want to be. The challenge is, I don’t currently have a job in the field and worry about how long it could take to get one.

I’m stressed about this decision because I only have about a month to decide. Should I commit to HVAC and stay with the company, or leave and fully focus on finding a software job? Any advice, especially from those who’ve been in a similar situation or who work in either field, would be super helpful. Thanks!",2024-11-13 01:36:43

I have been very happy with everything so far.

The issue: my workplace insurance provider and coverage is changing during open enrollment in the near future. I'll need to contribute around $100/month more for coverage that is objectively worse.

I know that a higher health insurance cost when you're not receiving better benefits is arguably a type of pay cut, and in the right circumstances it would be a decent reason to have a conversation about a modest wage increase to offset the cost. However, given the nature of my program and the fact that there is an end date in six months (at which point I certainly would like them to offer me a permanent position), my inclination is to forgo raising the issue now (and perhaps have that discussion if/when I am offered a position).

I would have to relocate to pursue certain careers. I also have a mortgage which would really put a strain on our finances if I were to stop working all of a sudden. Also, my degree is a BScN but it was from a 3 year program and not from a university. I suspect universities would look down on that.

This was rather unexpected and I've only been at the company a little over 6 months, but I will be getting a decent amount of severance at that time. 

However, A had a position open up in another department following the announcement and I applied. A month later, I interviewed and had a verbal offer the next day, with the start date being the following Friday. I gave a verbal acceptance, moved my stuff, and began training a week ago. I am still supporting my old team until the end of the year as well to wrap things up and assist in the transition.

However, the position is not very interesting, with little growth potential, and I don’t see A being around more than 2-3 years as a company. The position with A would give me time to look for something better, as the market is not great for my field at the moment.

During this time, another company, B, began the interview process, has indicated a significant amount of interest, and has moved quickly with their interview process. At the time I verbally accepted A's offer, I had a preliminary screening interview scheduled with B, but hadn't begun the interview process. B is a much more stable and established company. The position would also be a better fit and allow for more growth within my career. The position at B carries a title several levels higher than A, would have an increased salary, and is in a location that is a hub for my industry, but is across the country, which I am happy to move to. Currently, B is checking references and has indicated that they will make a decision, and likely an offer, at the end of the week or beginning of the next. 

In the meantime, A sent over a written offer yesterday. They expect me to sign ASAP, especially considering I am already moved and training for the job. However, they have not set a written deadline on my time to respond. 

I don’t feel like I can push B to speed their decision any further without risking the potential offer. I also don’t want to risk declining A and having B fall through, as I have no verbal or written offer for B. Ideally, I would also like to retain my severance from A if B does make an offer. I would lose any severance if I sign the offer from A.

How can I delay signing the offer at A until B makes a final decision in a few days? ",2024-11-13 01:07:10

I’m at a turning point in my career and would really appreciate some outside perspectives. I’m 28, working as a Marketing Specialist in a VHCOL area and making around 85K total compensation. I’ve been in my role for almost 2 years and feel like I’ve been pulling all possible levers to make an impact—advocating for growth, expanding my network, and tackling various cross-departmental projects. 

My concern is that my role is flexible to the point of lacking clear definition and the lack of direction sometimes leaves me feeling like I’m not making the most of my time or skill set. Although my efforts seem to be valued, my contributions haven’t yet translated into additional responsibility or compensation, both of which I’d like to see soon.

1. **Transitioning to Product Marketing or Product Management:** I’m interested in transitioning into a PM or PMM role where I can own product decisions and contribute more directly. Right now, I support GTM and sales efforts, but I don’t have direct product ownership, which I know may be a hurdle. Any advice on how to make a case for this shift or strengthen my experience without formal product ownership?
2. **Pursuing an MBA:** I’m considering a regional MBA program. My main concerns are around the ROI and whether it will broaden my job reach in the ways I need. I’m debating between part-time (while staying in my current role) or a full-time program. For those who’ve chosen regional MBAs, how has the experience been in terms of career outcomes?
3. **Exploring new job opportunities or advocating for growth in my current role:** Despite being a profitable business, layoffs have already affected other departments, and given the flexible (yet undefined) nature of my role, I’m concerned about stability. I’m debating between updating my resume and testing the job market or wait it out until my 2-year mark to see if a promotion or raise becomes more feasible, given my contributions. Any tips on navigating this conversation or deciding if I should stay vs. look elsewhere? 

Am I being impatient with myself? Happy to provide additional context. Any advice on making this transition, pursuing an MBA, or navigating internal promotions would be great. Thank you so much in advance for your thoughts!",2024-11-12 21:20:15

We were issued new job descriptions and salary ranges, and now, no position is secure. Each of us must reapply for roles, competing both with our colleagues and with external candidates. Despite this upheaval, there will be no opportunity for a pay raise. For example, if I apply for a staff position with a salary range of $52,000 to $83,000, and I currently earn $53,000, I won’t receive an increase because I'm already within the range.

Moreover, if we apply for lower-level roles, such as an AP Clerk position (salary range: $36,000 to $52,000), we’ll have to accept a pay reduction if we’re on the higher end of that range. If management deems us unfit for the positions we apply for, we’ll simply be let go.

To add to the challenge, the controller wants us to acknowledge in writing that we understand and accept these terms, including that we would not receive unemployment benefits if we’re let go under these circumstances. Also, remote work is no longer an option, which was one of the few positive aspects of this company – otherwise, it feels incredibly toxic.

I recently applied for a leadership program scholarship which is around $20000. The program spoke with my CEO as they weren’t able to offer me a scholarship, and my department has agreed to cover the cost for me. 

Only thing is, we are actively trying for a baby. This program starts the beginning of 2025 and goes for about 10 months, and you need to attend all the sessions.

I have no way of knowing if I will be successful in getting pregnant and I don’t want to tell my workplace this as the moment, as I am also applying for senior management jobs. 

Do I; 

1. Open up with my workplace and tell them we are trying and that we don’t know if we will be able to have a baby, but if so may not be able to attend the end of the program? 

2. Go with the process and if we do happen to get pregnant, tell them then? Even if it means commencing the program and the department losing the $$. 

I am just so worried about burning my bridges or having my employer annoyed about me for not being upfront about my plans for pregnancy.

The trouble is that the company's industry is in IT & data consultancy; a profession for which I have no formal experience or training. 

Any other organisation that I have come across are thematically based on working with autistic people as a specialist neurotypical as opposed to employing autistic people.

Until this past June, when I was promoted to be his equal. When I was a subordinate of his, I was regularly doing his work. There’s a lot of freedom in our work, which means a lot of grey space and he took advantage of that. He hides behind a “if you want to see it happen, then you have to make it happen” mindset and does very little proactively to support our team. I feel overworked because my expectation around quality of work is higher than his, and I try to remind myself of that but his slips seem to land on me and make me look not bad. 

An example is that there is a client where every Monday we have a task to submit paperwork for them. It’s not something he or I have to do - we just have to forward the information to someone to submit. I was out one day and he didn’t forward the information as needed. The email was to me, but he is always cc’d with the understanding that if I’m ever unavailable, he is supposed to forward. He knows this is the expectation. 

I recognize where I could do more to manage around his lack of working, but I’m tired and I don’t feel it’s my place to be constantly arguing with him. 

I’ve spoken with our shared director who is aware of the situation and is trying to push my counterpart to be a more productive member of our team, but the most advice he gives me is to tell me to figure out how to engage my coworker. I don’t feel it’s my job to engage him in the work he should just be doing, but he consistently finds ways to avoid work and make it my fault when something is not completed. 

I’ll say my upper leadership knows the work that I do and the quality that I produce compared to him, but I still take a hit to my pride when he makes a mistake in a way that makes me look inept. 

Is there any tactics to respond in these situations where I continue with my level of quality and still hold him accountable?

I feel like building some hard skills would help me make a stronger impact in any organization I work for, so I’ve been considering pursuing either a CPA or CFA. Since I don’t have any business credits, the CPA path would require me to complete 14 university courses (CPA PREP) and then work at an approved company for 2.5 years. Alternatively, I could start preparing for the CFA exam right away.

I’m very interested in wealth management and investing, so the CFA seems appealing; however, I understand that the CPA provides some more flexibility career-wise. I’m also weighing the financial difference between the two paths. My hours at work vary quite a bit because of our team structure, so I’d need some flexibility, which I feel the CFA program could offer.

Upon reflection, was it you, or them?",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpko6l/has_anyone_had_coworkers_not_fully_accept_you/,6,"I’d appreciate any thoughts or shared experiences on navigating challenging team dynamics. Here’s a bit of my story:

I worked at my previous company for four years. While I started in a marketing team for integration, I was hired for a different role and ultimately moved to my intended department, which I later started heading. My background—educationally, professionally, and even socioeconomically—was somewhat different from my teammates, so I knew I’d need to approach with humility and open-mindedness. While I got along with some people, I sensed a certain distance from others, especially some influential team members. Over time, it felt like I was the target of gossip or skepticism.

I genuinely tried to bridge the gap in various ways. For example, I made an effort to remember personal details, like asking about their children or pets, which I knew were important to them. I also brought pastries to the office kitchen as a gesture of goodwill, yet I rarely received any acknowledgment or thank-yous, either in person or in the team chat. I invited them by name to attend training sessions I hosted, hoping it would show I valued their involvement. But my invitations were often left without comment, even when others would compliment similar initiatives by different colleagues. When a teammate was promoted to interim lead, I thought it would be nice to call and congratulate her. Later, she told me she found it ""strange"" and felt it showed I cared too much about titles and status—a perception that seemed to create a further divide. From then on, she kept things formal and distant, showing little interest in connecting.

Over time, I moved departments and was on a different floor, reducing daily contact with them. But after a building relocation, I found myself on the same floor again and hoped for a fresh start. Despite my efforts, little had changed. For example, when I posted about my own promotion on LinkedIn, none of them acknowledged it, even with a “like,” though I saw them doing so for others.

In lunches, I felt like an outsider in their conversations, unable to engage fully. I’d stop by their desks to check in, but they never reciprocated. It felt as though I was constantly trying to connect, with little or no reciprocation.

Adding to the complexity, this team has had high turnover in recent years. Several people have left, even though new ones came on board, and the fluctuation rate remains high. The former team director privately told some colleagues she couldn’t even trust members of her own team, which contributed to her departure. A new director also confided in me that she found some team members manipulative and toxic, even mentioning who she planned to let go in the future.

In the end, my exit was partly attributed to “interpersonal deficiencies” and not fitting in with that team, and I suspect that influential members’ feedback to management played a role in the perception that I didn’t “fit.” I wonder if they saw me as arrogant or perhaps felt threatened by my achievements and drive to innovate.

My therapist suggested that people sometimes push back against high-achievers who aim to drive change, especially in environments where team members might feel less secure. As a foreigner who’s visibly different from the predominant nationality in the company, I also wonder if that played a role in feeling more isolated.

Despite my efforts to overcome these barriers, it feels as if there was always a “wall” with certain members of the team, even though others (mostly male colleagues) were warm and friendly. I’m not sure if there was something about my approach that unintentionally created distance or if it was simply a product of the team’s culture.

Have any of you faced similar experiences? Was it an issue of the team’s culture, or were there steps you took that helped improve the situation? I’m trying to learn and avoid similar experiences in future roles, so I’d love to hear from others who’ve managed or navigated comparable dynamics.

Gleichzeitig will ich aber auch nicht, dass die Kraft und die Zeit, die in mein Fachabitur geflossen sind, sich rückblickend wie eine Verschwendung anfühlen. Ein weiterer wichtiger Punkt ist, dass ich mir für die Zukunft hohe Ziele gesetzt habe, was meinen Verdienst und den Vermögensaufbau angeht.

Nun zu meinen Interessen und den Ansprüchen, die ich an meine zukünftige Erwerbstätigkeit habe.  
Meinte Interessen lassen sich in 4 Kategorien aufteilen:

* Handwerksberufe; Bauwesen; Gebäudetechnik; Naturmaterialien; Küchen- und Badgestaltung; Gartenbau; Natur; ""Abenteuer""
* Wirtschaft; Kapitalmarkt; Geldanlage; Altersvorsorge; Wirtschaftsrecht; Finanzierung etc.
* (Online-)Handel; Immobilienwirtschaft; Verkauf; Marketing; soziale Medien; ""Marktlücken finden & erschließen""; Selbstständigkeit
* Menschlicher Körper; Gesundheit; Sport; Körperoptimierung; Ernährung; Endokrinologie; Psychologie

Meine Ansprüche sind etwas komplexer zu beschreiben - wie bereits erwähnt, habe ich mir recht hohe Ziele gesetzt, was meine zukünftige finanzielle Situation betrifft. An dieser Stelle halte ich es nicht für nötig, konkret zu werden, sondern möchte eine Sache klarstellen - als gewöhnlicher Angestellter lassen sich diese Ziele definitiv nicht erreichen.

Da ich nicht glaube, dass ich als Person dazu passe, in der Konzernwelt die Karriereleiter hinaufzuklettern, gehe ich davon aus, dass ich mich in Zukunft selbstständig machen ""muss"". Dieser Gedanke spielt bei meiner beruflichen Orientierung eine große Rolle; der Beruf Fluglotse, den ich grundsätzlich interessant finde, ist dadurch beispielsweise komplett raus. Generell bevorzuge ich Ausbildungen und Studiengänge, die nicht extrem spezifisch sind bzw. eine gewisse Umorientierung ermöglichen.

Ein möglicher nächster Schritt, über den ich aktuell nachdenke, ist ein Duales Studium im Fach Bauingenieurwesen. Dieses Studium bzw. diese Ausbildung deckt mehrere meiner Wünsche gleichzeitig ab, denn ich sammle Praxiserfahrung, kann zumindest die Grundlagen in einem Handwerk erlernen und erwerbe einen Bachelor in einem Bereich, der mich sehr interessiert. Eine Tätigkeit, die ich allgemein sehr spannend finde, ist die Immobilien-Projektentwicklung. Momentan kann ich mir sehr gut vorstellen, mich später in meinem Leben in diese Richtung weiterzuentwickeln.

Eine weitere Sache, den ich nicht vergessen sollte, ist, dass ich gerne einen Beruf ausüben würde, bei dem ich mit verschiedenen Menschen zu tun habe, mich immer wieder neuen Herausforderungen stellen muss und möglichst viel Zeit unterwegs/draußen statt im Büro vor dem PC verbringe. Vor allem der letzte Punkt hat mit meinen finanziellen Zielen leider wohl eher eine konkurrierende Beziehung.    
  
Jetzt noch ein paar zusammengewürfelte Infos zu mir, die evtl. relevant sein könnten:

* Ich habe kein Problem mit körperlicher Arbeit und bin körperlich belastbar, will mir meinen Körper aber auch nicht kaputt arbeiten
* Ich bin gerne unterwegs und will die Dinge, die ich bspw. als Ingenieur eher vom Büro aus plane, auch in echt erleben und am Liebsten sogar am Bau bis zu einem gewissen Grad teilhaben. Ich bin wetterresistent und habe kein Problem mit Dreck o.Ä. 
* Für mich ist das Einkommen viel viel wichtiger als die Prestigeträchtigkeit von einem Beruf. Für mich gelten zwei Grundsätze: ich will für mein Geld nicht betrügen oder mich anderweitig strafbar machen & ich will nicht den ganzen Tag in einem Büro verbringen (mal ist es natürlich okay, aber es sollte nicht der Standard sein).

Alles in allem muss ich feststellen, dass ich leider gar keine richtige abschließende Frage habe. Mich interessiert einfach eure Meinung zu dem, was ich denke und niedergeschrieben habe. Seid gerne absolut ehrlich, ich kann damit umgehen. Wenn ihr in der Vergangenheit schon Mal in einer ähnlichen Situation wart, lasst mich gerne wissen, wie ihr euch entschieden habt und wie ihr jetzt dazu steht. Falls ihr euch beim Lesen gedacht habt, dass ich ein größenwahnsinniger Vollidiot bin, der sich maßlos selbst überschätzt - lasst es mich wissen, ein Reality Check tut mir sicher gut. Ich freue mich auf euer Feedback.

Vielen Dank für's Lesen, bitte lasst mich eure Meinung wissen und stellt gerne zusätzliche Fragen!",2024-11-12 22:07:34

I used to work on farms but can no longer do heavy labor like I used to. And the few jobs I had, I got fired from or nearly got fired from so I can't really put them on a resume. I'm looking for ideas for jobs that I can do with my limitations that will also give me a lot of job security. I don't mind going back to school to get certifications but I only have enough money left in my college fund for maybe \~4ish semesters. I'm in the USA.

Limitations:

* can't do a lot of heavy lifting, bending over, or anything that would put too much strain on my joints (worst joints are my shoulders)
* can't drive (public transportation is readily available where I live)
* also have some learning disabilities; I mostly struggle with math & understanding unclear instructions/expectations
* also struggle to read diagrams/graphics
* autistic, which causes me to become easily overwhelmed in social situations or in environments with a lot of sensory stimuli
* struggle with teamwork

Strengths:

* very good at noticing details
* really good dexterity with my hands & fine motor tasks (I'm a collage artist and am VERY skilled with an x-acto knife)
* good eye for visual layouts/design
* empathetic, compassionate; good emotional intelligence
* enjoy & am really good at public speaking
* great grammar & a good proofreader

Preferences:

* would prefer something predictable; I like repetitive tasks & can get through them quickly once I get into a rhythm
* I work best in small groups or alone with a high degree of accountability from someone else
* want something that has good job security in the future even if the pay isn't great
* if I need to get additional schooling, would prefer not to be in school for longer than 2 years if possible
* would enjoy working night shifts (I am practically nocturnal)
* something I can start doing part-time before I transition into full-time hours

careerguidance,1gpwrff,[24] Dropped out of Physics PhD. What is my best path forward to a good career?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpwrff/24_dropped_out_of_physics_phd_what_is_my_best/,1,"I'm based in the U.S. and have a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics. I left my Physics PhD after two years with no Masters (health issues). My long-term goal is to work in Data Science, but I'm struggling to make myself an appealing candidate for employers in this highly competitive field.

I have been trying to get jobs in Data Analyst positions but these are also extremely competitive and I have received zero interviews with \~100 applications to any analytics role that I qualify for. I feel a Master’s degree in Statistics or Data Science could strengthen my profile, but I’m uncertain about how to balance a program with a full-time job when most programs run classes during the day. Additionally, since I’d be studying while working, internships might be hard to fit in, leaving me without practical experience by the time I graduate.

  
Even if I gain the necessary skills for Data Science on my own, I worry that I’ll still be overlooked due to my lack of an advanced degree and professional experience. My family advises that I take a call center job and try to work my way up in the company, which feels like a poor fit for my skills and goals.

I'd really appreciate any guidance—whether it’s strategies for transitioning into Data Science, advice on degree programs, or other pathways that might help me build a competitive profile. Thank you!

I feel like I’m a bit of a dilemma. I did my MSc in HR 7 years ago whilst working as a HR Officer, worked my way to HR BP was with a company for 6 years. Then needed a change and am with my current role 4 months as a HR Manager in a different sector. 

I’m not enjoying my job, I felt like that for the last year in my previous role and thought perhaps the company / role had run its course and also wanted to move up. I’ve moved up since but am not enjoying it at all, nothing role related it’s a nice company with nice people (a bit much recruitment due to the company growing). I just feel I have to drag myself in every day and cannot wait until I can finish up. 

I don’t really know what to do. Do I look for another HR role or explore something different? What kind of skills are transferable if I do look for something else? 

I think I’m getting tired of always being the messenger and dealing with other people’s shit. I think I’d prefer something where I can get on with my own stuff and pop my headphones in and not be on meeting after meeting after call.

I have a current offer with Caterpillar for rotational program out in Peoria Illinois and an offer with Lockheed in Florida. Salary wise Caterpillar is offering between 90-95K for my starting salary vs Lockheed 70-75K range is what I’m told.

Currently it’s been a back and forth battle to decided between taking more money with CAT and moving away from family and everyone I know vs getting to still live with parents, rent free and knowing if I get sick or injured I would have someone there. A friend however had made a good point that it’s helpful to start my career at a higher salary for negotiating in the future for jobs. So am I crazy to say no to CAT take Lockheed at lower salary but get a potentially paid masters degree and still get to enjoy living in Florida with my family?

Backstory:  I worked with Lockheed as a contractor so I already know the team and enjoy what I do. So any Lockheed employee advise on how to get bumped up in salary besides negotiating I would take, because my offer from CAT expires (even with my requested extension) before I get the offer from Lockheed. But I would still try to negotiate either way. In addition I would like to know is it worth moving around different programs to get a bump in salary vs Level up in Lockheed? I’m already blessed with a good manager but some other employees say moving around to different programs could help but also u take the risk of bad managers.

Hello I am a 24 year old from the UK with a degree in computer animation that I never really used and its not something I'm particularly passionate about. The only options I was thinking of when it came to finding a career is to go into social media marketing and doing motion graphics videos, this too though is very difficult for me to get into given how competitive the market is. I did try to work a minimum wage job but it was soul crushing and draining. I'm now considering to go back to college to go to trade school because all my skills (Design, IT, web design, Videos) are either being automated or outsourced. Whenever I apply to anything related to graphic design or media its just instant rejection or ghosting. Job center is even more useless and recruitment companies call me offering jobs that require 10 years experience and I dont even have 1 year 

The only options I can think of where I can get a career that isn't going to wreck my mental health and will actually be enjoyable is something related to trades like carpentry, I did want to try other creative options like a webcomic or make infographic motion graphic animation videos for social media but that ofcourse doesn't pay and takes a long time to be something i can make money off of if that ever does happen, its very frustrating and upsetting and I don't know what to do at this point I feel like a total failure ",2024-11-12 21:40:10

The role requires you to be licensed by FINRA and the first four months are spent training and learning so you can obtain the licenses needed. Employment is contingent on passing the exams to receive the licenses. Upon getting into the role and material, I realized I’m not interested in the material and the training is too fast paced and rigorous for me. Per my post history, I’m concerned if I can even pass the first exam we are due to take in a month because the material is so rigorous. Because of this, I reached out to my old job to see if they would hire me back. I was only at the job for about 3 months and the role does have high turnover. But when I took the job, I had been looking for months and that’s all I could find at the time. I’m also applying for other roles as well since I really need employment and money to get back on track financially. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. If I don’t pass the first exam at my current job, it’s highly likely I’ll be fired or have my pay reduced while I continue to try to study for the exam again all within a month’s time.

 I recently mentored a person who was in the QA team of a reputed organization.

 **ADVICE ASK : I am 4 yrs in QA and not able to utilize myself to get to better growth salary opportunities. Please guide.**

 Initially, the problem sounded was of stagnation in the current role and hence the salary was also not growing in alignment with the experience. However, after few discussions, it came out that the person was in the same role for the last 4 years and had been doing manual testing throughout. While there had been many opportunities provided by his manager to help him learn new skills (automation), while there was a reluctance to learn , interestingly the aspiration for a higher compensation.

 It took me time to explain to him to invest time and energy in upskilling and keep the horizon open for new learnings. With the advent of Gen AI, testing automation is getting most of the benefits and hence its important to upscale oneself at the earliest possible time.

I live in the UK, have a well paying job as a software engineer and still living with my parents just outside London. I feel I'm in a very fortunate position since finishing university at the end of 2023, but can't help but feel I'm playing life too safe and not taking enough risk.

For many of us, we have this clear path from a toddler to early 20s, go to primary school, secondary school, sixth form, university and then just like that your out in the big wide world. Where suddenly you have unlimited choice to do whatever you want, whether that's travel, move to another city, start a business. For the past year these choices have floated relentlessly around my head driving me crazy at times.

I really want to travel or move to a different country (like Canada or USA). However, the logical side of me just cannot figure out how this could would work out. The markets are extremely saturated for my industry (tech) in both countries, and getting a visa sponsorship after only a year in the industry is not realistic. The other option, with nothing really stopping me would be to travel for 6 months or so, to see the world whilst I'm am young and have almost zero dependencies and outgoings. However, again I feel suddenly dropping the career I've worked so hard to get into makes zero sense, and many of my family members agree.

Moving out is almost always a suggestion when discussing this with relatives. I would love to move out, maybe to London or down by the coast where I can enjoy water sports. However, again and again logically it does not make sense! My office is a 15 minute drive from my parents house, I pay small amount of rent to live with them and am able to save a substantial % of my income because I have very few expenses.  It makes so much financial sense to remain at home, but I just feel like I am wasting some of best years of my life remaining in the same area I spent my whole childhood in, with the same people and things going on around me.

Ultimately, I don't want to look back on my early 20s regretting that I didn't do more and played it too safe. I suppose my question is has anyone else felt overwhelmed with choice after finishing university, and how did you solve it? And do you any advice on how to ensure I don't look back on my early 20s and wish I had done things differently?

TLDR - overwhelmed by choice since finishing university. Have a great well paid job but feel like I am playing my early 20s too safe. How best to navigate these critical years?",2024-11-12 21:20:53

I like my current job from a technical standpoint and I like what I can do in my current company, but I’m finding myself in a difficult position due to, shall we say, “weird” interactions among people.

My boss is a great person. I’ve known her for a while and she tends to appreciate the work I do.

Unfortunately, my boss and her boss are at odds, for reasons that would be pretty hard to explain. You would think this is just a thing between her and her boss, but it absolutely isn’t.

 I’ve found myself arguing with my boss’ boss, multiple times, for hours, and it honestly gets tiring, especially because I’m not a manager and I have no real authority over anyone, so I don’t see why I should be dragged in the middle of all this.

I’ve also spent a lot of time getting to know a lot of coworkers from various teams. I understand the grass is always greener on the other side, but I feel like people in other teams respect me more than some people I work with and some of my bosses.

I occasionaly think about moving to another team, but I like what I do right now, lateral movement right now is pretty difficult and I think my boss would be pretty disappointed because she usually appreciates my work. I don’t know what’s going on with my boss’s boss and whether or not he’ll go further up the chain.

If I leave, I may get out of this mess but it’s going to be pretty hard to go back in case I don’t like my new position.

If I stay and I keep siding with my boss, things may go well or not depending on what my boss’ boss will do in the next years.

If I stay and I side with my boss’ boss, this will probably strain the relationship between myself and my current boss and it will probably force me to handle some things in ways I don’t like (specific technical issues).

I even stated it in my description. Not sure why that was the first comment... 

I don't know if this is the truth, but I have started applying for jobs in the last few months and when I fill out the applications, I select that I do have a disability. My disability is not visible, so I'm starting to think I should stop disclosing it. I haven't received one interview since I started applying. 

About three years ago, before I was diagnosed, I applied to a couple of jobs that I saw in passing and was interested in. Both jobs I made it all the way to the end in the interview process, but ultimately was not chosen.

I know I'm qualified for the jobs I'm currently applying to. I'm mid career. I have a bachelor's degree. I've been at the same organization for 7.5 years and been promoted twice. However, I'm looking to expand more and I'm realizing that I can only get a REAL raise if I leave. They recently gave me a ton of new work without a raise. I brought up a raise. They gave me an insulting raise in my opinion and cited it was because of budget, but they are hiring three new positions. So...

Anyway

Maybe it's not the disability, but I still might stop disclosing it because I feel like it's probably not helping either. ",2024-11-12 15:05:48

I am (22) M and have a recently graduated with a criminology degree (2:1), the reason I did criminology is because it opens a lot of doors into the career I would like to go into - crime prevention.

Since I was a child I have always wanted to be a homicide detective - I find myself fascinated in human behavior, why do some people commit crime and others don’t? The age old nature vs nurture debate.

After uni I was hit by the same situation I’m sure most graduates/ people my age face - unemployment and living with parents (unless you are one of the few that had an internship or a direct career path e.g medicine)

Fortunately, although it isn’t what I want to do I have found a fairly secure job in recruitment in my town at home where I can save up enough to go traveling by January 2026. I also have goals to buy a house (put a deposit down, and have an ISA to make this easier + a girlfriend who wants the same)

I have always wanted to travel go and see Thailand, Bali and South Asia and Australia and I feel that because i’m young enough almost everything in my life can come after this - as this will hopefully give me a good insight in what I enjoy doing.

The problem is I’m starting my police application which is a lengthy process lots of stages in the recruitment, and I will expect that on average it takes 8-12 months to actually get started. 

What i’m interested in if anyone knows - does holding a degree in criminology make it faster - I understand that everyone has to do 22 weeks in police college before they are assigned their own unit. But surely because I hold a degree in a subject with lots of modules focusing specifically on policing it will speed this up?

Also would you guys suggest that I start this process before or after I go traveling?

careerguidance,1gpv2bn,Advice on this?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpv2bn/advice_on_this/,0,"Hey everybody,

I’m currently interning at a fashion company in Netherlands. I’ve had a few unpleasant incidents with my manager and manager’s manager in which i will briefly explain here.


On my first day, and considering that i had commuted 3 hours to reach the office, i was hungry, i read/heard from some-body/where that the company does offer lunch and for breakfast you’d have to pay. I ask around and find that the kitchen is downstairs, i go downstairs, i ask the kitchen staff if they serve breakfast to which they replied no. To which i reply okay and headback upstairs. Situation ends here, well atleast from my side. 

Another day, i was also a bit hungry and had asked for a 2nd portion from the canteen staff, they said they don’t do 2nd portions. I just leave it at that.


Kitchen staff then goes to my manager’s manager and complains about me, saying that i demanded them to make me breakfast, i said that there food was shit to the lunch-lady and demanding 2nd portions. Manager A decided to put the whole blame on me, said that this is company policy and that i’m going against company policy. 

On another instance, i asked the lunch lady if she can give me an extra scoop, to which she replied no, i then asked her why not? It’s just a scoop not portion, she says “you can make things difficult but you’re not getting another scoop” she then starts shouting, takes her gloves off and throws away and goes downstairs, presumably to complain. I go to my manager, explain the situation, to which he goes to manager A and manager A decided to talk to me again about that incident, tried to remind me of “old mistakes” and said that she’d be embarrassed to take me with a client. 

Manager A as a person is the typical narcissistic, unappreciative, i-know-it-all attitude with unbelievable ego. I want to get revenge because this b*tch is trying to irritate me in any way possible and the fact the way she made me feel no other person should feel it. 

After these instances, my manager decided to give me the most mundane, analytical and no-learning-opportunity tasks. He wants me to analyze around 20k+ products individually. Every single week. He is also trying to delay the only task in this internship that you actually are able to learn something by burying me with bullshit tasks that have no value-added. 

I’m actively trying to switch jobs and applying vigorously. However, before i leave i have to get my revenge on this b*tch. Do you guys have tips on how i can do that?

careerguidance,1gpuokq,"I have a great job, but the owner seems to be a shyster and the future is uncertain. What would you do?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpuokq/i_have_a_great_job_but_the_owner_seems_to_be_a/,0,"I am 30 years old with an A.S. degree in general studies and a B.S. in organizational leadership. For both degrees I earned a 4.0+. I currently work for a family member's tree service and also recently got my real estate license.

Hopefully this isn't too long, but thank you in advance for any input.

Real Estate has been picking up but isn't going full-time anytime soon, and I'm not sure about the future with my current full-time job.

On the positive side, in my current position, the tree service has been the top one in our area and I like being a part of that. I have helped with the company since I was young and I currently have a role as basically an assistant foreman. We have a crew of 4 guys plus the owner and I have been doing it full-time for about 10 years. I understand everything in principle and know how to concretely do most of the work except the climbing and the more complicated bucket work and rigging. We also make really good money that is far better than any other tree service I've ever seen anywhere.

The downside is the owner who is my family member seems to be a pathological liar, now that he is at retirement age he seems to be running the place into the ground, and he is back and forth on whether he is retiring or not. He is charging astronomical prices, being rude to some people, not calling some people back, and telling some people we are out of business, he retired, that he sold the business, to call the other guy that works for us, and/or that he is going to retire. In general I would almost say he lies just to hear himself lie. More specifically, one second he is telling one person he is retiring in the spring, and the next second he is adamant that we are going to work again next year or for years to come.

He told me and others before me who got fired that he was going to sell the business to me which I was expecting for a few years until I heard not from him but through the grapevine that he was actually going to sell it to the other guy on the crew. Now that guy is annoyed and is leaving to start his own company and bringing a coworker who is his bestfriend with him. This happened after he got sick of waiting, and the real nail in the coffin was after the owner made us stay to work in a neighborhood where the SWAT team was in the middle of an armed hostage situation and telling everyone to stay indoors. He then lied to us about what the police told him.

Whenever I talk to the owner he says we are definitely working next year, then later we hear from customers or through the grapevine that our owner is retiring. This exact thing happened today after talking to him and then a customer. Then, when the owner hears through the grapevine that he is retiring, that he did retire, or that someone calls the other guy that works for us, then he gets mad and says he doesn't understand why that is happening. 

I don't feel it would be right to leave to work for the other guy even if there was an opportunity. He is really good, but our owner has been talking him up for years as if he is the only one that knows anything and pointing everyone to him, and now it seems to be coming back to bite the owner. There is more competition than ever, but this was our slowest year in as long as I can remember despite our reputation. More and more people are telling us his prices are crazy, that he's retiring, and that he is being rude or not calling back. I've seen some of it firsthand. Since we are losing at least 2/4 guys I'm also wondering if we will even have a crew.

I am also curious because even when he is talking about selling his building, he says he is hoping I'll get busier with real estate, but I haven't got a single client from him, and he is supposedly talking with some other random guy about selling the building. The guy who is leaving said he doesn't have any insider information but that the owner talked about listing the building now that Trump won and that he told him he will work until the other employee leaves which is probably the spring. Then the owner told me today he was thinking about it and that he decided that he is definitely going to keep the business going next year.

I want to stay because it is good money, I like the job, and I don't want to be a jerk especially to a family member and leave after saying I'll work next year. The downside is I can almost see the writing on the wall, I don't want to be left without a job or work to be super slow, and unless I found something for $75,000+ in our small and depressed town then I would be taking a hefty pay cut.

I have an opportunity with another tree company but it is a way worse company and way worse pay, and if I need a new job I'd like to put my degree to use more. In general I've always considered and saw myself as more white collar although I am good at blue collar work. I also intend on getting my commercial drone license but have no CDL.

Talking to the owner isn't an option and neither is taking it over because he won't be honest even with himself and he seems to maybe be running it onto the ground.

Do I risk it and stay for next year and stay or find something else?

First of all im in the 12th grade and i live and study hs in Qatar.I once did vounteering at a trauma center and it was the best week in my life.I have really good medical knowlegde that impresseed a 2nd year med student i know. Most teachers at my school call me doctor because of how much i talk about medicine.Though if i were to study medicine it would most likely be in europe (probably the Netherlands) because everywhere else is expensive.
 But i also love electronics. I tinkered with arduinos in the 10th grade then went on to drones in the 11th and i still love building and flying fpv drones. I also got into building PCs in the 7th grade. I also really love maths and im always asking my teacher about stuff outside the book.As for ee i would most likely do it in America cuz the job market here is very bad ( half the salary of a teacher for an engineer).
I feel like they both require loads of studying (which i dont mind). I like working with my hand and both fields fit. I love that both filds are constantly evolving and both have great job security and salary.

So basically i am in my early 30s and my last job title was revenue operations manager, prior to that i was also a sales ops professional but i started as BDR/SDR. My last job (Revops manager) it was a contract job and that’s why it ended. I was job hunting for the past 2 months and couldn’t find anything relevant to my recent experience, i found this open remote job as an SDR for a start up and i casually applied. Long story short, they sent me a very low pay offer and i politely declined and moved on, a week later they sent me another offer with a slight increase, since i was unemployed and the job was remote, i agreed and signed the offer letter. Now 2 weeks in and just started doing the SDR tasks (cold outreach and cold call) now i came to realize that i might have made a huge mistake. After being at a good position, i came back to being an SDR and prospecting all over again. The company is a start up and they said i am over qualified yet decided to hire me since they believed i would bring much to the table, i don’t think i will…i feel so lost, i am thinking of calling it quits but i am afraid to do so and lose a paycheck and god knows when will i land my “dream job”.

Over the last few weeks I’ve been really anxious about whether this degree is right for me, I started in September and was confident about it, however slowly that has changed, I am at my local university that is a 45-1hr commute from my house, which means I’m not getting the uni experience and havnt made any friends, I have people in my lectures that I talk to but nothing more than that, it is difficult as I’m only there for my lectures.

It’s an okay university for engineering, I couldve gone somewhere better, but it was a last minute decision, and this university was one of very few that clearing was still open.

I was meant to study computer science at a different university, but a week before I was moving in, I got cold feet and decided to switch to here

The reason I picked mechanical engineering was because I was good at maths, and I think I want to invent things, I am enjoying the maths we have done so far however all the other modules, I don’t really find interesting and am forcing myself to go to them, and as far as inventing goes, engineering is more just given a set of limitations to follow and not much freedom is allowed

I have spoken to friends and family and I get mixed reactions: “stick it out, it’s a good degree” , “it sounds like ur not enjoying it, don’t waste time doing something if you don’t enjoy it”, other stuff but those are the 2 main contrasting responses.

My problem is I don’t know if I’m rational in these thoughts or if it’s my anxiety telling me to leave because that’s the easy thing to do, as in the past, I have given up on hobbies when they get too difficult or I get frustrated that I’m not getting better. So I don’t know wether I’m leaving because it’s the right thing to do and I truly don’t want this career, or if it’s my anxiety and poor judgement telling me to quit because it’s easy to do so, I also have problems with procrastination, which my gp thinks may be due to hdhd, so I’m getting that checked

I just don’t know what to do right now, I am not sleeping and my I’m not going to lectures as I just can’t, I get to the university, have a breakdown and call my mum or Samaritans(mental health help line)
I don’t know why I can’t go in to them, im just really struggling mentally at the moment

 
So how do I make a decision, my mental health is so poor, and im addressing that and getting help, but I need to make a decision now about university, wether to commit to this or leave and find something else, but then I would be 2 years behind as I already took a gap year last year, I just don’t know what to do

I am currently a 22-year-old (m) student at a state university, I am majoring in Homeland Security, with a dual minor in Spanish and National intelligence. I speak English and Spanish and recently started learning Persian. I live in Southern New Hampshire, close to both the Veteran Affairs office and the Portsmouth New Hampshire Naval Shipyard. I'm currently looking to get an internship with the local PD due to the concept of having experience with local law enforcement seems like a good idea to me.

I will be graduating this upcoming Spring, and I am beginning to stress over the concept of getting a job. I am primarily interested in foreign affairs, national intelligence, and environmental security, I love languages and would love to find a way to work with both. I am ideally looking to work federal but I am open to private sector jobs. I have a 3.3 GPA, which I know isn't great but it's not awful. I have minimal community service hours, roughly 40 from high school, but that is largely due to my time being taken up by work to pay for my tuition and my taekwondo.

In terms of job experience, I have worked in food service as a bartender and server for the past 4 years to help pay for my college tuition and I am currently scared that my lack of valuable previous experiences will be debilitating to my opportunities.

Does anyone have any experience or insight on where to go from here? I am considering grad school but I'd much prefer to gain experience within the work field for a few years before reevaluating my stance on that.

Thank you for any insight that is able to be given.",2024-11-12 18:40:49

careerguidance,1gprprw,Any career ideas for me?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gprprw/any_career_ideas_for_me/,0,"Hi! I´m a young man current in a gap year, wanting to go study next fall. I´m in doubt about what is right for me, and I thought asking random strangers online would be a good way to get some advice. So here goes.

**Some details/facts about me:**

* I have a fairly broad field of interests, although I haven´t found a passion yet. But some of my (academic) interests include history, biology, aviation, politics, military strategy and medicine.
* I generally prefer a past-paced work environment, ideally with quick results. I have an easy time keeping calm, I could see myself in something involving emergencies and quick decision-making. On the other hand, I tend to struggle a bit with long projects and discussions, especially when it doesn´t feel productive. 
* I prefer working in person. I find working remotely very draining.
* My grades are quite decent, albeit not straight As. I´d consider myself reasonably intelligent, although far from a wunderkind. I have no special talents that I know of, but I have found myself to be capable of learning most things with relative ease.
* My personality is quite... Ambiverted, as in I like socializing, and get along with most people. I have also learned public speaking and enjoy it, even if it didn´t feel natural to be. I also really like entertaining people. But at the same time I am not the ""life of the party"" kind of guy, and I definitely need my alone time. I think I got ESTJ on an MBTI test, even though it is obviously heavily flawed.
* My hobbies include road trips, outdoor activities, travelling, boating, mountain biking, paddleboarding and (youth) politics.

As for careers I have considered, there are a few. My childhood dream was always to become a military aviator, but to a back condition, that dream is not coming true. I could also consider becoming a commercial pilot, as I still have a strong interest in aviation, even if I am not sure if it is the right choice for me, due to the monotony and loneliness of the career. Medicine is also another option for me. I just attended an orientation at a medical school, and found it very appealing. Teaching could also be an interesting option, as I have done it on a couple of occasions and really enjoy it.

Currently I work as a homecare assistant and private tutor. I especially enjoy the latter. As for being a homecare assistant I´d say I enjoy the tangible results, the human aspect, the quick working pace, the independence, and the healthcare aspect. However, I enjoy the household chores, and being in a job with about zero authority and respect amongst the general public much less. 

So is pretty much the situation. I appreciate every input and suggestion I can get. Feel free to ask any questions. ",2024-11-12 18:31:26

Eventually, one of my old bosses sent me an opportunity, to say I wasn't excited at all would be an understatement, but I interviewed well, got an offer, and had nothing else available. 

The role was about as miserable as it could be. I was pretty good at it, but management was some of the worst people I've ever dealt with and my first time in a full sales role. To get away from management who seemed to want to ruin me, I pivoted and interviewed for an Account Management role internally. 

That did work, I'm now onboarding as an Account Manager, something I've done for almost 4 years...but the AM role here is quite literally NOTHING like my previous roles. I'm a digital marketing person, always worked in Search but kept being pushed into this role, instead, this is an entirely Creative/Display focused role. I am positive I can learn it, but the acronyms are wild, tasks are literally ALL over the place, the team acts like everything is a fire drill already, and I'm in general insanely lost on exactly what it is that my job is responsible for. 

I'm doing everything I can to take notes, but half of what I'm hearing on calls is literally just knowledge from being on the accounts. I'm insanely nervous for the person I'm replacing to leave. All the questions she's been getting on calls, I would have legit NO answer to anything, they need requirements? ""Well idk what they are, give me 24 hours to talk to people and ask what we need"" would be my answer. Client wants to push creative? ""Cool, if you can give me 2 weeks, I have no idea what you're trying to run, we didn't cover this in onboarding, and idk who you even are"" would be my response. 

They all seem to act like I'm coming on as an experienced AM, which tbf I 100% am, I know my shit, but I can't help but feel that I'm in a role I have zero reason to be in....the money is okay, but its not seeming like something I feel I can do well at, at least not initially, and I'm extremely worried....how should I make sure I don't look like a total moron while I am trying to figure this crap out????",2024-11-12 18:27:40

I also work as a web developer with 2 years of experience.

I think nothing really prepared me for ""university life"". It's not hard academically per se, but very hard on my mental health. Lots of people said it would be the best time of my life but that I would have to study a lot. None of these are very true for me. I feel useless, lost and lonely. I envy people that have it all figured out and know what they want to do, but how am I supposed to choose without knowing what each field will be like for me? I fear most my life becoming just a blur and a daily grind as I have already seen myself become a completely different person just from going to university. I went to a career advisor, but she wasn't of much help.

I think what I want most is to feel useful and to contribute to society and science. I want to make a difference for a lot of people. I feel that working directly with people can be a pain but it's worth it. I also want a work-life balance so that I have time for my hobbies, and decent pay so that I can support myself and possibly a family in the future.

I have been unhappy with my company because of various reasons and have been applying to other places for work.

I recently just got promoted to the next engineer level and on a new team that’s titled “software engineer”. Titles in this company can be misleading a lot of the time. The team that I am on now mostly deals with IT.

About me: I have been a professional writer for more than 25 years. I am in my late 50s. All of my experience is in marketing writing - basically, everything you read that markets people, products, and services - websites, brochures, emails, biographies, case studies, emails, guides, ebooks, etc. Unfortunately, due to the proliferation of AI and outsourcing, work has almost completely dried up. I've been doing this a long time and I've never seen it like this. Thousands of fellow writers are in my many online writing groups every day saying there is no work. I have got to figure out a way to make some money as I am barely scraping by and am living off my savings. I had a 6-figure job that I was laid off from 18 months ago and I have applied to thousands of jobs, done tons of networking, upskilling, cold outreach, paid job coaches, signed up with employment agencies, you name it. I am barely making a living from freelance writing, and the work I do have is a race to the bottom in terms of rates.

The challenges - Here's where it gets complicated.

* I am unable stand for long periods of time or do jobs that require physical activity, so all retail and restaurant work is out, as are jobs like working as a healthcare aide, cleaning, etc. I have degenerative disc disease, a grade 2 spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, and scoliosis. I am unable to stand for more than about an hour before my back pain gets excruciating. I do not qualify for disability because I am able to do work sitting down.
* I am also hard of hearing, so I cannot do work that involves talking on the phone all day because even with hearing aids, my hearing is not good enough to understand everyone, especially people with accents. For example, I've tried several times to get a job as a transcriptionist, but my hearing isn't good enough to pick up voices accurately and I've failed those tests. I also have a terrible time calling customer service for help with things because I can't understand people on the other end of the line. So work cannot require talking on the phone as the main job, such as telephone customer service.
* I do not have my own car. I have access to my partner's car, but he does NOT want the car used for a job like door dash or instacart, racking up miles and adding wear and tear to the car and I have to respect that.
* During school months I must drop off and pick up my child from school (I use my partner's car). There is no other way for my kid to get home, who I have custody of every other week. I do not live in my child's school district; I live in a neighboring town and there is no bus that goes anywhere close, nor anyone from school who lives nearby who could give my child a ride. It is way, way too far to walk; it would take over 70 minutes one way and we live in a very snowy/rainy climate. My child is in 9th grade and not even close to being able to drive. Pick up is at 2pm, so whatever job I have has to be ok with me leaving for an hour to pick up the kid in the middle of the afternoon, take them home, and then return to work to complete the workday. I also cannot work evenings as I need to be there to make food for my child, help with homework, you know, general parenting. Further, my ex has indicated if I plan to work evenings all week during my custody period and leave my kid alone in the evenings he would file for sole custody. I am not going to lose custody of my kid because of work, I just need work that works around my schedule, which is daytime availability, with some flexibility.
* I am also responsible for the care of my elderly mother, who has dementia and bipolar and lives in a memory care facility. This requires daily phone calls and emails during business hours, taking her to doctor appointments, and responding to emergencies - about one a month - where she has to go to the hospital due to a fall or other medical event. Most recently, for example, she had to be picked up immediately for bizarre behavior towards another resident during a manic episode. This is not something that can wait until evening when I get off work. I had to take her to the ER where we waited for 27 hours to meet with the Psych resident, who then admitted her to a psych hospital for two weeks. So I need flexibility so that I can take care of things for my mom during the day. It's not every day, but it's about an hour each day, on average.

The most logical fit is full-time office work, which is what I've done for 25 years (preferably remote, but local would be ok too) but getting anyone to consider a 56-year-old is proving to be impossible. Early in my career I worked as a secretary and so I have also applied to hundreds of remote secretarial jobs but, understandably, never even get an interview as I have no relevant, recent experience, I haven't done that work for more than 30 years. I have applied for EVERYTHING I could do as a job - receptionist jobs at a senior living facilities, at spas, at auto dealerships, roofing companies, data entry, AI training, you name it.

Changing careers at this point would be extremely difficult. While I'm still excellent at my chosen profession, I don't have the mental sharpness I used to for learning brand new skills (thanks, menopause) so becoming some kind of internet coder or learning data engineering or something is completely out of the question. My brain wasn't suited to that work 30 years ago when I was young and fresh, and I sure couldn't handle it now. I am also quite bad with numbers and math so anything accounting or finance-related is out of the question.

Does anyone have any ideas for what I could do to make money? What am I missing?",2024-11-12 14:06:35

One of them was that I wouldn't be told how long I would be working there, as in the case of my temp assignment at a call center as after 3 months, I contacted my recruiter and manager, who told me that there was no end of date to the assignment and that I would be working there ""for however long they deem me to be necessary."" I resigned 2 weeks later after that.

My final assignment with my temp agency before leaving them was working at a local county government job as  an administrative assistant taking calls, filing reports for coyote sightings, filing papers in order, and was later assigned to timekeeping. However, when I asked how long the assignment would be, all I was told was that it would be ""as needed BUT if I worked really hard and proved myself that I could be made a permanent employee.""

My biggest concern is that I know that I am nothing spectacular in this field (I’m good at some design software, like AutoCAD, Altium and SolidEDGE). Generally I’m a lot better in IT and maths related stuff, so I’ve been struggling to decide if an MSEE would be the right path.

Since I was always pretty good at math I thought I could do something econ/finance/accounting related instead, but I am afraid these roles are boring compared to the stuff I do currently.

I could also do an IT related masters yes, but I never felt like those courses really worth it. I always read about people not liking them because they’re outdated and one could learn the stuff they’re interested in alone more efficiently.

I was actually considering an MSME as well, since I was really enjoying using SolidEDGE for some of my personal projects.

Currently I make close to 100k in IT but it requires 3 days of commute ~2hrs each way. Most of those days I leave the house around 7 to be on site by 9 and leave around 3 to be home by 5. There are some good benefits like fully paid health insurance for me and 50% for dependents. I started at this job almost 3 years ago and everything was roses at first but due to poor company management of finances this turned south fairly quickly once the fed money printer stopped and the companies we work with downsized. Things have been steadily getting better but they cut our 401k match and I dont imagine that returning any time soon. I also expected to be promoted by now or at least a raise and that still hasnt happened. Maybe some time next year but who knows. There are some areas for career growth if I stay here but looks to require more time in than initially positioned, or i need to pivot to a new job in the field. 

The place Im applying is a well respected university and the position would be fully remote. Maybe somewhere between 80-90k with great retirement benefits. The benefits are good in some ways but the health insurance wont be what Im getting now. Theres some career opportunities but most likely lateral movement between departments and would require several years of dedication to get anywhere. It would be very stable (already seen 3 rounds of layoffs at my current job) which is welcome because me and my wife are looking to start a family. 

The idea of fully remote sounds great. Thats a lot of time saved commuting which is offset by the lower salary. I dont know if its sunk cost fallacy but part of me wants to stay where Im at in hopes of making more money/getting promoted vs starting over at this new place. However, to reiterate its fully remote and theres tuition reimbursement so I could potentially further my education and get a degree in something that takes me out of IT (dont love IT but it pays well). My wife makes decent money and I have a side gig which brings in another 10k, so we arent strapped for cash but also live in a hcol state. I feel like this could be a fork in the road of life for me and feel conflicted either way so Im looking for advice or similar experience to help me choose which route to go. ",2024-11-12 16:34:25

I feel like I've met many people who genuinely enjoyed CS through my major and it made it clearer to me how little interest I had in it. The most enjoyable time I had during my 4 years of college was my Software Engineer internship, but that was primarily due to preferring the consistent 9-5 schedule and liking the office space. The actual coding part could feel a bit boring/uninteresting to me a lot of the time.

So now, here I am. Graduated and unemployed(cause the job market kind of sucks for new grads rn), and it doesn't help that I also just feel like not an ideal candidate for most jobs anyways(middling GPA and most of my internship experience was in iOS development which is more niche).

It's already my seventh year working at the same company, and until recently, I felt like I was doing the right things. For perspective, I started here as a Marketing intern while I was still at university. After several months I got an offer as a Junior Digital Marketing specialist.  
After almost a year in the position, I was offered to change departments and become a Marketing Manager in a newly developing startup (part of the conglomerate where I work). It was very interesting because it was a blockchain startup and was very ambitious. But after being there for over 2 years I started to notice that nothing was changing and I couldn't bear coming to work not just sitting there, more I was recently married at that time and asked for a pay raise and was rejected (""cause we weren't doing anything"" this is the manager's response), so I asked for the change, again internally, and got the job of the Head of Operations of one of the main platforms of the company, which was also very interesting and I have learned a lot there. 

It was a year ago when I was doing some research and trying to apply to different jobs in the field that I found out that Operations is a very broad market and there is no such job as Head of Operations if you're not offered a COO role, you won't be able to find a job when needed (at least in my country). This is where I decided to learn something new, from scratch, considering I have time and energy for a career change.  
I learned Product Management and went to an interview for a vacant position and got the job, it was one of the smaller products of the same company. 6 Months passed and the Senior PM of the Platform Product who was the Head of Operation left the company, and the product department had no other choice but to offer the role to me, as I was the only one in the company who had the knowledge to do the job.  
  
The only downfall was that I am now a Junior PM and should forget about a pay raise at least for some time. 

It's hard to work in a Junior Position in the same company after being in the managerial one before. 

I can't help but think that I was in a bit hurry and that If I stayed in one of the roles in any of my previous teams I would have had more success. 

I would be better paid as a Senior Digital Marketing Specialist. 
The startup I left had a huge success, and the core team I was part of had dividends from the management like more than 6X Yearly Salary. 
Or maybe I shouldn't even change the Operations role? And stayed with some pay raises but no ambition to change the company whenever I want? 

P.S. Sorry for the long post, but I need some advice from people who have more experience than me. ",2024-11-12 16:13:50

I got laid off in 2020 for Covid and also had a kid the same year.

While laid off getting unemployment and the stimulus extras I ventured into the crypto space. I made enough money in 2021 to live off for some years.
Fast forward to today I have full custody of my son and have him everyday (his mother lives out of state so he doesn't see her) leaving me with a tight schedule and almost impossible to work a full time job with his pre k school etc. I still try to make money in crypto but it's not sustainable or consistent (more like gambling) but I also helped build many projects building websites etc. during 2020-2022. I plan to take a bunch of courses to learn those skills completely from the ground up doing web design-web dev-graphic design and would love to get into freelance work and hopefully land a job somewhere I can work remotely by next year when he’s in school full days. 

Just wondering if this seems like a possible scenario or situation that can pan out. I know I have to build a good portfolio and learn all the necessary skills needed to be hired by a client/employer. But my main question is the market over saturated for someone that's new to this field?

Should I be looking to learn a different set of skills rather than tech industry? The reason I'm choosing that is I enjoyed doing it in crypto and I do have some contacts still in that space and being a developer/designer in crypto is an in demand skill during a bull market (which seems like has just kicked off)

At the start of my career, I worked at tech start-ups. They were small and great in terms of work-life-balance, but as someone who was still full of energy, I wanted more of a challenge. 

And so I moved to a larger tech company that was in between being a start-up and being corporate. I learned a lot and really enjoyed my time there. It just wasn’t sustainable because of how fast-paced and demanding it was. So after 3 exciting years, I moved on. 

I am now in an even larger tech company, which leans more towards corporate. I get paid pretty well and get to WFH on some days, but the culture is awful. Politics is rampant, there are so many inefficiencies, kissing ass is the way to go, bullying is not seen as bullying, etc. 

I was willing to put up with it for a little while, but recently, my boss got a lot harsher with me. He gets mad when there are delays (even if they are things outside of my control) or when my updates are not concrete enough for him. I don’t mind feedback and learning how to improve, but the way he reacts has resulted in me feeling fear and having anxiety everyday. 

I talked to him and he got nicer, but my teammates tell me that it doesn’t last. He always goes back to his regular ways because there’s no changing him. 

The work is eating into my personal life now because the increased pressure has doubled the work I need to do in a day. I end up OT-ing a lot now to deliver the expectations (but still get scolded) and because of this, I feel down everyday. I’m starting to feel tense all the time and I’m eating less. It’s only been this way for a few weeks, so it’s not SUPER TOXIC yet. I’ve gone through worse, but the signs of it reaching that point are there. 

A lot of people can withstand the company and my boss’ ways, but I’ve determined that it’s just not a fit for me. 

I’ve begun sending out my CV, but I don’t feel motivated to take on any of the jobs I’ve been seeing. I think I’m drained. Maybe I was actually still tired from my previous job and this one just completely pushed me to burnout. 

I think what I want (and need) is a break, but I just want the opinion of others. I have the funds to go on a short break and I want to explore part-time jobs while I’m on break. 

What do you guys think? 

Should I just resign now or put up with it for a few more months to reach closer to a year and then resign? Should I put up with it for a while longer in case it gets any better?

Is it okay for me to just not apply for any job first and take a break? 

P.S. Changing teams is not allowed, and most teams are just as bad, if not worse.

\- 1 month in, and my manager has become comfortable yelling at me in front of customers. Our shift lead is also scheduling me full time hours (I can't do as a full-time college student already struggling with studies), even though I was only hired on for part-time.

\- 2 months in, my older coworkers are starting to ridicule me. I hear them talk about me behind my back, but I just try to ignore it.

\- 3 months in, I feel unappreciated and disrespected. I also started getting used as a scapegoat for my coworker's mistakes. They say every time, ""she is new"" even if it wasn't my mistake.

\- 4 months in, I submit my resignation. My manager asks if I'm putting in a 2 weeks notice. I say yes, (to help them with the new transition in the workplace) but as I submitted my notice, my manager tried to guilt trip me into staying 3 weeks, instead of 2. (In his words ""we have you on the schedule for the next 3 weeks"")

Today I finally snapped. As my coworker tried to confront me in front of customers about another patient, that I was not yet trained to help, I went off. I had been asking for help dealing with the patient for over 30 minutes and they barely offered support. Yes, they were busy too, but if they had set aside 5 minutes to demonstrate what to do, the patient would not have waited 40 minutes, before receiving proper help.

After I explained my frustration, my coworker's true colors showed, and she threatened me. Yes, I slightly raised my voice to the woman twice my age, that has been bullying me for months, but she was out of line. I didn't even have to come in today, but I offered to help because someone no showed. I was then accused of coming in late because they mixed me up with the person they originally scheduled, that never came in.

I've heard enough apologies from my coworkers to know, they are all fake by now. I stuck with this job because it required a certification I went to school for, and my family also encouraged it. I can't stay anymore and I'm ashamed I did for so long. I found a new job opportunity, but my confidence has really taken a hit, I even have some anxieties about new workplaces now.

Should I continue my 2 weeks notice or just be done?",2024-11-12 06:10:58

When I was thinking about what to do in the future, there were few options I could think of. 

 I could work really hard and land a job in a product-based company. The job would definitely pay well, but all the layoffs and recession is making me wonder how stable my job would be. Also my parents really want me to do a government job. 

 When my parents insisted that I prepare for a government job, I looked up on what options I have. I don't want to do a job where I am just doing routine work everyday, and let's be honest, we all know how government jobs in India are. I came across ATC, and I was really fascinated by the nature of the work. However, doing a government job would mean that there is a societal pressure and you can't leave the job at your own will without society shaming you. 

 I always dreamt of being a writer/author since childhood. Even though this dream never felt feasible, now that I am participating in contests and also receiving compliments for my writing, it feels feasible. However, regardless of what I am doing, I want to write books even if I wouldn't be able to monetize it because leaving everything for writing wouldn't be such a wise decision (what do you think?).

I’m feeling really lost and frustrated, and I’m hoping someone here might be able to shed some light or offer advice. I’ve been job hunting for what feels like an eternity now. I apply to multiple positions every week and get absolutely no response, no interview invites, nothing. It’s really starting to wear me down. 

I’ve spoken with experts in my field—people who have looked over my resume and said it’s extremely impressive with no changes needed. I have a degree in Art History, almost three years of relevant work experience, and an internship at a museum under my belt. My references are strong too, but despite all of this, I just can’t seem to get any traction.

I know the job market is competitive, but I can’t help but feel like I’m missing something. I’ve started wondering if maybe my cover letter is where I’m going wrong. Does anyone have a tried-and-true template or suggestions for writing a compelling cover letter? Or if you’ve been through this yourself, what did you do to stand out and land a job?

I’ve been networking a lot and making strong impressions, but it still feels like nothing is landing. I’m just feeling really lost and could really use some guidance or encouragement right now. Thanks so much for any help you can offer.

Most of the people I know have transitioned into Tech consultancy, and I’ve thought about future career paths and I would like to know if anyone here has information on which career paths, with reason is “better” than the other? Such as having the greatest potential, salary / developing skills for either Product Design, Tech consultants and product manager, specifically in London. 

I’m looking for jobs which would not require too much emphasis on coding, but jobs such as UX engineer or Frontend engineer I would not mind. I’ve done research on salaries / career paths but each website seems to be telling me different salary ranges. So I would like to ask for some opinions on great related Tech jobs, and see what everyone says, and it does not have to be limited to London as well, thanks :) 🙏 ",2024-11-12 11:43:24

I would like to present my life briefly :

I have always been a kid fascinated by physics, especially everthing heat/energy related. I started reading all kind of science books when I was young and I still do for fun. Im currently on my third year of a 3 years Bachelor called ""energy and thermic"" where I study HVAC systems (im not doing the installation part just the sizing of the equipments just to summarize quickly).

But on the other side, I'm someone that doesnt likes staying at a souless corporate office that sucks the life out of you (like im doing right now haha). Let's say Excel Spreadsheets are not fulfilling my inner child curiosity.

The other passion in my life is art, especially architecture, stone masonery, glazing, fencing,... There is a group of craftsmans in my country (called ""Les compagnons du devoir"", a very old and recognized institution) that can teach you all of these (and you are payed/housed/fed but must work at the same time). Restorating old buildings is somthing that would really makes me happy and fulfilled I think.

I don't see myself being an employee all my life, maybe for the next few years, but at some point I would like to create my own company. I don't desire to spend a life behind a computer watching a screen all day long without moving. This is why Im scared to pursue my studies, I'm scared to be locked inside an office as a technician/engineer. On a last note, I'm a confirmed scuba diver and I can weld, so I was tempted to become a commercial diver but Im scared to dislike the job (long hours, difficult working conditions,... same for most kinds of blue collar jobs I guess).

In 3 months I will have to make a choice concerning my pursuit (or not) in a master or engineer degree. I'm not sure if these 2 or 3 years will be beneficial. Is someone relating to my experience ? Is there some sort of White collar job where you sometimes need to do manual stuff (I mean blue collar style kind of work)? And finally, is someone here working in art/craftmanship ? Some tips ?

I have been doing her backlogs and never helped my one. 

It got to the point where I have done putting up with her. I have been telling about her to the manager verbally but no changes. Today, my friend who is a hiring manager wanted to hire one engineer for her team. She was asking if I'm interested in joining her team.

We ended up talking about the role responsibilities and expectations. She was quite happy to take me into the team but she asked me one question which I didn't know how to respond to it. She asked me if I have problem with my team or manager. I was a bit hesitant to say bad things about my teammate considering that she's the hiring manager although she's my friend. 

We are actually close before since we worked under a bad manager and had talked heart to heart about stuff. Although I wanted to be truthful, I didn't want her to see me joining her team to run away from the bad teammate. Should I have done so?

Looking for some career help from someone with more experience/ outside opinion. 

I’m currently early 30s, corporate Finance at a large non-public company (500m). I’m making $185k + 20% bonus ( paid every year for the past 10 years). I’m largely remote, going in 1-2x every 2 weeks. Commute is 1 hour each way. 

I recently was contacted by a company for a new role, doing FPA + M&A + Business Transformation work. Similar pay and bonus ( not as guaranteed). They are trying to go public in 3-4 years. This would also be 4 days in office, roughly 15 minutes from my house. 

My current role is not very demanding / not much is expected. I’m worried i won’t continue to learn and grow and could miss out on future growth by staying. This new role has a ton of growth already and more opportunity continue to appear as they are buying 1-2 companies a year. 

Am I crazy for considering this role? Am I just in the “grass is always greener” ? While comp is great and expectations are low, I find the day to day tough, especially after finding success in prior companies that were more demanding / faster pace.

careerguidance,1gpd997,My boss is super angry with me! How should I deal with this? ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpd997/my_boss_is_super_angry_with_me_how_should_i_deal/,1,"I had a specialist come into my work to consult on a situation that is under my direct responsibility. My boss supports me with this project though he has ultimate decision making and has advised me as to certain things (I am required or strongly encouraged to take his advice). 

I did not always agree with his advice but I was not fully sure because I am newer, so I followed it regardless and only voiced concerns very little bit backed down whenever he justified his advice. 

The consultant strongly disagreed with some of his advice. In explaining the situation to the specialist his decisions came into question. I did not do this intentionally but I simply explained what had been done. 

I believe he is very angry with me and blames me for making him look bad. I believe the consultant had some harsh words for him. He has been behaving angrily and in a very hostile manner towards me since then (a few days). 

I am very worried because my licensing evaluation is coming up. He even brought this up and reminded me he has the decision making power and that he will have suggestions and I will pass if I implement them. 

He also said things like ""I like to be challenged"" in an angry tone and told me to submit a report advising on something he makes decisions for. I was honest and told him what I believe when he asked me (against what he had done), but now I see I probably made him even more angry, I should not have been honest and should have just tried to appease him. 

He was hostile in a recent meeting and embarrassed me in front of my coworker and assistant. I have never seen such a thing happen before in my workplace. He would ask me questions and then rebut each answer I said, over and over. It is a very professional place with a strong code of conduct so this was very unusual. 

Up until now he has always been extremely friendly and kind, maybe even flirty to some extent. 

I am worried and scared for my evaluation. To top it off my coworker hates me and I think has been jealous of my great relationship with him until now (I think she has a crush on him - we are all around early forties.) She is constantly trying to undermine me to him. I now realize that he acts a certain way when she is there (more friendly to me) vs. when she is not there (more friendly to her). (Based on what I've told my husband, he thinks something might have happened between them - if this was the case they could both lose their jobs.) 

What can I do? Should I say anything to my boss or behave a certain way? I am thinking of asking if everything is ok and to be apologetic, and say it was not my intention to call his judgment into question and that ultimately I trust him (which I do). 

Quitting is not an option unless I want to not be able to pay my mortgage. He is my top reference and all others are connected to him and would be influenced by him. ",2024-11-12 05:05:32

I apologise if this is a question repeated often here, but I'm asking myself as I want responses as accurately relating to my case as possible.

I'm a 24 year old in the UK, and I've been working as a video editor since I was 18. I never got much of a higher education and I struggled greatly in school. This was due to family circumstances as I had to move around the country and abroad. I came out of school with just an A in English and managed to obtain a Level 2 BTEC in Media. I started work as a Video Editor for a corporate company from there. As the years have gone by, I've started to realise that this isn't my passion, and as I've become more independent as a person I've started to realise my passions and what I want to do in the future. I'm also a high-functioning autistic, but I don't usually divulge this as I don't want to be limited in the eyes of others.

I'm very passionate about politics, in particular foreign affairs and specifically how foreign actors use the spread of mis and disinformation to shape narratives. I'd like to do something in information/intelligence analysis in relation to conflict or other foreign affairs. Anything in that kind of realm really.

I have applied for foundational roles in relevant security services and I have gotten someway through the recruitment processes but have been rejected along the way. I also have some questionable family affairs historically that could impact my ability to obtain a security clearance, but they're distant enough for me to want to take the chance. I also applied for the military under the guise that I could work my way into Intelligence but I was declined on a medical basis due to a lifelong respiratory condition.

I have searched around for what kind of relevant careers there are in this field, but it seems that previous experience working with OSINT or similar are required, or some higher education qualifications in Machine Learning, Comp Sci, International Relations, Mathematics etc. I've looked at some possibilities of studying these but all seem to require funding which I cannot provide for myself. And due to my academic history, I'd prefer to work in some foundational role and be able to learn that way and work my way up - this is how I've progressed in my current career. I would welcome higher ed though, if I could get there.

I'd like some guidance on some of my possibilities here.. I considered visiting my local Army Careers centre to discuss this exact thing, but I'm not sure of how much use that would be. If I am just dooming, please tell me also. I just feel unmotivated and stuck with my current career, because I'm not educated in much else, but seeing a path to what I want to do seems difficult.",2024-11-12 10:40:42

Recently starting working at a new company getting paid about 40 an hour to support elderly clients in their home. Usually shifts are only 1-2 hours and 1.5 hours for cleaning shifts. More than half my scheduled shifts are cleaning and I feel tired already. Having broken shifts and driving house to house all day also sucks. I don’t think I can work here for long. 

Does anyone have ideas for other jobs I could try. I’m seriously at a loss. I tried university twice and nothing came of it. Possibly because of lack of confidence, mental health issues. I feel like I can put on a front to interact with clients/customers but it exhausts me so I don’t think healthcare jobs would be suitable.

Let me share a real world example.

 

My father was into education, working as  Head of Dept in a PG College few years back. One fine day , he was enjoying a cup of tea at out house gate in the morning on a Sunday.

I was in my engineering days, just completed my second year and was at home then.

 

Around 9:30 am , a sadhu approached my father and asked for alms “Bhagwaan ke naam par kuch de de baba’.

My father was in principle not keen to support people who beg as he thought people should do effort if they can rather than beg.

As my father naturally frowned, he looked at the sadhu. That person was 5, 11, well build , clean shaved and had a personality which was not merging with the sadhu clothing of his.

This irritated my father more and he shouted “ Kaam kyu nhai karte ho, why begging “ \[ Meaning – Why don’t you work instead of begging\]

The sadhu said “Meri kismat main bheek bangna hi likha hai” \[ My fate is forcing me to beg\]

This angered my father more. He said, ok -  “Clean my porch area with water, I will give you 5 Rs for cleaning”

He refused, stating , “Meri kismat main kaam nahi hai, mujhse nahi ho payega”

 

My father was furious now, and he shouted at the top of his voice “Bheek maangne aa jate ho, kuch padhai bhi kari hai ya nahi” \[ Have you studied anything at all?\]

That sadhu replied “ Sir, maine MA in Pol Science kiya hai”

My father was surprised and interested now. Surprised, as he didn’t expect the sadhu to be a PG graduate and interested as this was his subject of expertise.

 

Next question he asked “ What do you know about the Indian Political framework”

The sadhu spoke for good 3 mins in detail. He was quite at ease of explaining. My father didn’t say anything , just nodded.

Next question “What do you know about the Indian international relations in the UN”

The sadhu replied , with the same ease, only this time he spoke in English. The level and fluency at which he spoke was good, considering he same from a small village in UP.

 

Next, I was called by my father outside, and asked to bring a chair and a cup of tea for him. I was surprised why is he offering so respect to a sadhu who just came for alms.

My father asked the guy “Will you be able for a demo class for teaching tomorrow? “

He said “Yes”

My father asked “Hope you have right appropriate formal clothes for the class”. He nodded

 

Next day, during noon , my father came back. I was curious about the class the sadhu took. MY dad was impressed with him. He said , the whole class of BA was appreciative of the teacher.

My father, being the HoD, approved him taking 2 classes from that day \[ evening / temporary lecturer\]. He started getting paid INR 6000/ from that day.

 

After 3 months, he came back to my father and aspired to enroll for a PhD. My father , got him a guide aligned so that he could work on it.

Another 4 months, someone reached out to my father about a part time lectuer opening in a college in West UP. My father was prompt to ask this guy if he was interested. He was ok , and my father sent out the recommendation to the University for his application. This brought his pay roll to 25000/ per month.

 

After 2 years, one fine day , a husband wife came to visit my father at home. They came in a car.

On meeting my father, that guy touched his feet, and asked “sir , do you remember me?”

My father wasn’t sure who he was, so he asked him.

He smiled and replied “Sir – the sadhu whom you gave the evening classes to teach , is a full time lecturer in a degree college, and I completed my Phd, got married and now on a got on a payscale of 65000/ , in just 3 years.

This is all due to you”

 

My father said: “This is all about your hard work and dedication. I was the means to help you achieve it”

 

And then we have a good tea time together.

Stay in current role or look for another job in accounting(talking to others they say its the same environment) get chartered and then if I want to leave for the police or go down forensic accounting route.

One option is a Data Science major, which is heavily focused on math, statistics, and programming. The other is Information Systems and Business Analytics, which has a mix of business-focused data analysis, SQL, and programming, with less emphasis on math.

Math isn’t my strong suit – I’m okay at it, but it’s not something I’d say I excel at. I’m pretty good with coding and computer science, and I actually enjoy it. I’m also a big fan of working in Excel, so I like the idea of using it as a data analyst.

My main goal is to land a data analyst job after graduation. I want a degree that will give me the best chance of finding a job in the field without overloading on a bunch of advanced math if possible but if that’s not possible than that’s ok. 

Would a data science degree give me a significant advantage in the job market, or could I still be competitive with a business analytics degree? Any advice or experiences would be hugely appreciated.

To put it into perspective, I currently live in CA and I'm only getting paid around $17 an hour as a pharmacy technician. I make around $2000 a month (after taxes) and only get to keep around $100 - $150 a month to spend after paying off all my bills.

I've been looking for a way out for the past few months now (I would say roughly about 4-5 months or so at the moment) but I haven't had any luck hearing back from any of the other jobs I've applied to. My current job lacks a lot of workers (probably because it's such a low paying job for the amount that we have to do) and has gotten so bad for my physical and mental health that I find myself dreading each shift. Every inch and soul of my body tells me that I want to leave the place, but I know that I can't because I need the money to pay bills. I've been doing my best to just suck it up and go to work while I try to apply to different jobs, but after months of hearing nothing back, I find myself giving up.

I have thought about trying to build up a side hustle to rely on as well so that I can leave the place while I look for a more stable income elsewhere, but every time I finish a shift, I'm left so physically and mentally exhausted that I find it difficult to focus on anything else other than eating and sleeping.

On the 2 days that I do have off (I don't get 2 days off in a row fyi), I find myself struggling to focus on building a side hustle because I burn out and can't find the motivation to do anything.

More recently though, because of the spike in anxiety to my mental health and physical exhaustion from running around the pharmacy so much, I have been calling out from my job and have instead, invested the time that I should be at work into writing. I found out that I was able to focus much more efficiently on writing my online novels and that I could potentially build that into a career instead of suffering at this job.

The only issue with that though is that there is also a large part of me that tells me it's a stupid idea.

Obviously the wiser option for me would be to continue working at the pharmacy while also writing my novels on the side until I am able to turn it into a steady income.

The problem with that though is that I've already tried doing that, and find myself too exhausted to be able to focus on writing.

I feel like I'm stuck in a hole with no chances of getting out.

So now comes the stupid question. What should I do? Should I continue to put up with my job and try to work on building this on the side? Or should I quit my job and focus on doing what I want to do?",2024-11-12 00:48:00

Biggest issue, this new location isn't anywhere close to where I live (compared to our current location which was fairly convenient, aka the reason I applied to work there to begin with). Despite that, there's going to be an expectation that people work out of there.

It would cost me about 50% of my daily salary to commute there and back which would obviously not be worth it. I've made it known to higher up's that this would become very difficult for me to continue working there if that's the path they've chosen. I know they won't fire me but I can sense in the back of their mind they know I am just as likely to leave next week as I am likely to stay for months.

I'm mainly just venting here but as much as I don't want to leave I also don't want to be working somewhere that'll cause such a hardship. But this jobs expectations even before this move are ridiculous where I'm supplying myself at my own job, expected to use my own laptop, my personal email, if I need any sort of supplies (anything as simple as a pen or stapler) I'm scavenging around trying to find it somewhere, have no access to actual company resources like a printer, and never know on any given day if I'm finishing the day at the same building I started at, or if I'm even finishing at the time I'm scheduled to finish (can't tell you the number of days I've found out after 4:30pm that we're not finishing at 5).

Thinking about leaving and working elsewhere stresses me out too because I've worked here for a while now and have loved working there for the most part and I do horrible with job interviews.

The first job is a hotel front desk job where I am in charge of checking guests in, cleaning the lobby, occasionally folding towels, and checking the pool occasionally to make sure guests are following rules. I was told that I could work on homework or whatever I needed during downtime. This is a part-time position with rotating weekends which I don't mind. I was told the most difficult part of this job would be calling drunk guests and telling them to stop causing disturbances, and they would most likely listen after one reminder. The employer is very sweet and this job pays a little bit more than the second. This job would also allow me to eventually take up an internship within the next year which is a part of my college requirements. Lastly, this job pays 50 cents more than the second, which isn't a lot but hey it's nice.
2. The second job is working with marketing at my local tabletop game store. A dream of mine is to have my own tabletop game store or cafe similar to this one. When my friends and I drive past this place we always call it ""my future store,"" like we are manifesting it. However, this job was advertised as a part-time position but the workload is making it seem like it is full-time. I have to write the weekly newsletter, travel to take pictures and videos, advertise events physically and digitally, report weekly analytics of social media, and various other store things, and keep up with store reviews and customer data. There are also a few more tasks I am failing to mention here, but I feel that the scale of what they are asking me to do is much more than a part-time position. I was told I cannot work any more than 30 hours and no less than 20, as that does not work for them financially right now. I would also be able to make my own hours, which is nice when planning around class. I fear if I take this job I will not focus on my school as much because of how big of an opportunity this is for me. I am also afraid I will not be able to take up an internship under this job. My golden handcuffs are that this is an industry I want to look further into and have a chance to be a part of and look stellar on my resume, but it seems much more stressful and could hurt my schooling.

Every day I go back and forth on what is the right fit. I have already accepted the second job and start later this week. I have about a week to make my decision on the first job. I'm really fortunate to have these opportunities I just don't want to mess up. Please help if you have a similar story or experience.",2024-11-12 05:02:08

During my internship, I worked hard on my project for two months, often staying up until 2 AM after coming back from the office. The work culture in the company became so toxic that I wanted to quit halfway through. They never reviewed my code, and if the client found any issues, I was blamed, which was really frustrating. Despite the challenges, I managed to complete my internship and received a job offer with a 3 LPA salary. However, the company has a 6-month probation period, and if I want to leave, I need to serve a 2-month notice period.

After much thought, I decided not to continue with the offer because the experience left me mentally exhausted and demotivated. It's been a month now since I rejected the offer, and I've been looking for a new job. I'm also considering doing another internship, but I’m thinking it might be better to spend the next 3-4 months focusing on improving my skills and then applying to better companies to increase my chances of getting hired.

I (21F) am headed to new jersey for a final round job interview at a top company. FINALLY!!! (new grads can understand the pain lol). The recruiter did mention lots of candidates selected for the program are from the local area so like Rutgers university, NJIT, etc. I didn’t want the fact that i’m out of state to play against me so i didn’t mention it (i also wasn’t asked either). Also I think the reason it didn’t come up is bc my college was in that area and it’s a target school so i think they just assumed i was still there. Anyways I just got the email that the in-person will be next week. The only issue is i’m in california and the email about the in-person interview didn’t even mention anything about arrangements for out of state candidates. It makes me think they just assumed we’re all local? My question is, is it worth asking for travel costs reimbursements? LORD i’ll be so broke if i have to pay for this trip myself. i don’t drive (was suppose to test for my license literally the day of the interview ugh). So that means I’d have to pay for a $500 flight, uber from the airport which is an hr away from the company’s location so like $100 uber, then hotels etc - like after that, i would have blown all my savings lmao. My worst fear is having the recruiter be like no sorry they don’t cover or they realize i’m out of state and that ruining my chances? But again this company isn’t small by any means. Very huge in the industry - i doubt it would cost them much to cover me so just wanted to get people’s thoughts. I think i’m just a nervous wreck bc i’ve been on the job hunt for so long and really can’t ruin my chances. They are supposed to reach out with more details soon so maybe that will answer my questions but flight prices are going up by the minute so not sure if i should just go ahead and book it by myself.  

TLDR: Got invited for a final round interview in new jersey, BUT I live in california and am not sure if i should ask for travel costs coverage because i think the company apparently has a preference for local candidates…

careerguidance,1gpa9bk,Which path should I take?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpa9bk/which_path_should_i_take/,11,"I’m a 26 year old male currently living in California. I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering but no internships. For the last year and a half I have been working in an entry level IT position (Computer Repair Technician). I have been having trouble finding a new job and have even been contemplating a career change. I’m at a crossroads right now. The choices I’m contemplating right now are either to keep pursuing a career in tech or switch to the medical field. 

My problem is I don’t know exactly what role I want in the tech industry. I’ve done a lot of self studying and various projects in different tech skills. To list some of them off I have studied multiple languages (Python, Javascript, C, C++, SQL) roles(full-stack developer, DevOps, Data Analyst) and technologies/tools (Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker). I also have the AWS certified cloud practitioner certification. I have also looked into some networking certifications such as the CCNA but don’t particularly enjoy the content.

Because of the tough market and my inability to decide on a particular role I have contemplated a career switch to the medical field. The particular role I have been looking at is Radiologic Technologist. The reason I have been thinking about this particular role is because I have friends in the medical field who have told me that it is a good role that doesn’t need too much extra school. I believe in my ability to do the schooling and do the job however it’s not something I am particularly passionate about. 

Some other details about me, on the Myers Briggs I am an INFP. I have looked at what jobs are compatible with this personality type. I am looking for a job that is fulfilling and I am passionate about. 

Which of these career paths would you take? Am I being unreasonable in wanting a fulfilling job and one I am passionate about? Am I in a situation where I am viewing the grass as greener on the other side when it really isn’t? Any and all advice is welcome. ",2024-11-12 02:23:02

In 2016 I graduated with an intermedia arts degree, essentially experience in a variety of art, theater, and dance. I learned a lot, but there was never any concise focus on a particular medium of art. When I graduated, I found a job and two internships, but left them with nothing to show from that. Fast forward to 2024. For nearly six years I've worked at a coffee company, and as of now I am a shift supervisor with my managers rooting for me to move up to assistant store manager. But over the past few months I've felt I've been questioning where I am in life. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my job and the people around it, the benefits are great and I feel content working there. But I know that I won't work in retail for forever, and now I'm beginning to look elsewhere.

Here's the issue. I have done nothing with my art degree all this time. For a while after college I had to deal with some mental health issues that I won't go into now, but for all intents and purposes I am starting over. No portfolio, nothing. It's not a bad idea for me to start taking classes online for computer programs such as Blender, but honestly I also just don't see myself working as an artist, so for right now it's just for a hobby and for therapy. My conclusion right now is that if I want to do something new, a career that I can be comfortable in, I might have to go back to school.

So far I've been reevaluating myself, taking career quizzes from Truity, and such. What's been on my mind as of now is going back to school to learn from a STEM field, such as electrical engineering or even mechanical drafting. I don't have a definite answer yet, but it's a start. The main thing that I'm hesitant about is the concern for money. My first degree cost me quite a lot for nothing (admittedly I'm responsible for that nothing, but still), and if I want to something completely different I fear I might fall back into the same problems before. If I invest in my future I want to make sure it's a good investment, which is why I'm looking into such a drastic change from arts to science. I guess what I'm asking is where should I go from here? There's a trade school nearby that offers associates degrees, and there's also the nearby university, but if I go for a bachelors degree I'd essentially be doubling my student loans. How can I better look into what I want to do before I make such a huge investment into my life? I’d also appreciate if anyone else could shed some light on my situation.",2024-11-12 03:10:34

Looking for guidance for myself from a professional pov.

My problems:

* Lost with what I really want to do in life
* Never found anything I truly loved professionally in my exploration of 10 years
* I never want to use my brain (I have to push myself hard to focus) and I am not sure if this is normal
* Most of my interests were outside professional life, and I often jumped from one interest to another
* In general, I am unable to commit to anything for long because I lose interest. Then I don't get good reward and it is spiral down from there.

  
Brief about my profile and calibre:

* Changed roles a few times, tried different industries and work setup (B2B, B2C, startups, MNC, mid-sized companies). A little afraid and tired now to leave everything and start something totally new
* Did great academically although I did not work hard
* I am naturally great at sports, and I feel proud of this. But I am unsure if the early 30s is the age to start something professionally that is highly demanding physically and also rewarding enough.
* Creative



My problem may seem like a privileged problem but it has led to extreme mental stress, anxiousness and always being in my head for the past 10 years. Because of unsettled feelings in my professional life, I also never found a happy personal life.

I hope to connect with someone who may have had a similar journey and found their way out.

Hi everyone, I graduated with a B.S. chemistry degree recently, and after a well deserved respite, I am ready and prepared to enter into the work force. However, with some preliminary research, it appears that the demand for chemistry graduates(at least undergrads) has been stagnant. I am feeling a bit worried and doubtful of my decision to pursue a career in chemistry, which is why I’m here, asking for some advice from those who are further down their career path than I am and gaining some insight on things I should do and watch out for in the near future.

A little bit about myself first, so you can (vaguely) understand my situation better. I am Canadian, and I enrolled in a university in the US and started studying in September 2021. I believe I am a very good student; I graduated cum laude and a year early by August 2024. I gained some independant research experience as an undergraduate in an organic polymer lab, and then shifted to a biochemisty lab, where I assisted a graduate student with a project. After graduating, I spent a few months in my home country to spend time with family, and now I am well rested.

The main problem/concern I have with respect to my career is that I am hesitant to choose a career path out of the hundreds of options availiable for me; I am afraid I’ll be stuck to a low salary dead end job with no opportunities in my 30s. For example, my research tells me that any of these sectors are valid options for a B.S. Chemistry graduate: material science, patent law, food sciences, cosmetics, environmental science, instrumentation sales, forensics, toxicology, etc. Some people tell me to choose the one I like the most, or most “passionate” about, but I think that is BS because…how am I supposed to know which one I like without a complete understanding/experience of what a job in any of those fields entail? Personally, I want to choose a path that strikes a balance between good compensation, future career prospects, and difficulty/safety. I don’t really mind if I dislike the job, just as long as I don’t loathe waking up every morning. How should I navigate this problem and ensure I make the right choice in this pivotal moment of my life?

A secondary problem/concern is the location of the jobs; although I am Canadian, I intend to work in the US via the [TN visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals) and eventually get a green card, and choosing a location with the best employment opportunities, cost of living, safety, and many other factors out of the myriad of cities is daunting. Given the current state of the US, I realize that certain cities are so disparate to others, moving from a US city to another could take more adjustment than moving to a different country. That is scary, and I do not want to make such a costly mistake and end up discontent with my enviroment. With that being said, which factors should I take into consideration when picking a city to move to? Is there any discrimination against non-US job applicants? Which cities should I absolutely avoid? Any comments or suggestions will help, as I am pretty clueless when it comes to US cities.

careerguidance,1gpdan7,How do I find what fulfills me? Facing an existential crisis and abandoning safe career plan. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpdan7/how_do_i_find_what_fulfills_me_facing_an/,0,"I’m 19, in college, and I don’t know what to pursue anymore. Before, I planned on getting a degree in computer science and becoming a software engineer. However, the fact that the market for computer scientists today is so inflated, AI might be taking jobs, and I just don’t enjoy coding has led me to abandon that goal. The only reason I decided to pursue that path in the first place was because I have a family member who makes an insane amount of money from coding and when I was 15, I looked around at the people I was close with and they were all doing computer science too.

I don’t know why, but I didn’t even think to explore a path I actually had a passion for. I just told myself that I should just focus on making money for now and spend the rest of my days doing what I want. Even now I don’t know if that philosophy is wrong or not. I’ve heard of people that work their asses off when they’re young to get high-paying jobs, and I know I could do that too and then wait to reap the benefits, but I can’t stand another day working towards a career that I don’t have any interest in.

I watched a clip of this speech that Jim Carrey gave. He talked about how his dad didn’t follow his dreams and instead worked a “safe” job which he later got let go from. He made the point “You could fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance at doing something you love.”

I’m young, healthy, hardworking, optimistic, disciplined, and have a good head about me. I know any goal I set I’ll eventually achieve. I’m tired of wasting my potential chasing something I don’t want. The problem is, I don’t even know what I want. I’ve been painstakingly thinking of what I want to achieve and make the most out of my life with but I don’t know. I want to wake up every morning with a fire ignited in my soul rushing to any opportunity to work towards a certain something. I’ve been craving that feeling but I don’t know where to get it from.

The next semester is coming up, and we’re gonna start choosing our next classes. I spent so much time on computer science that I didn’t explore the world around me enough and I don’t even know what I’d be interested in. I know it takes people their whole lives to figure out what they want to do, but I have so much potential ambition it feels like I’m going to explode if I don’t direct it somewhere.

I don’t know what my passion is right now, but I know it includes helping other people. Before I die I want to leave this place better than it was before I came into it, even if it’s just a small degree. I’m the most content when I get to see other people happy. Could anybody give me some advice on what to do from here?",2024-11-12 05:07:46
careerguidance,1gpda5n,How can I be pragmatic about my progressing my career?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpda5n/how_can_i_be_pragmatic_about_my_progressing_my/,0,"Incoming rant -- some advice from some people who have been in the industry for a little longer would be much appreciated.

I currently work at a small healthcare company doing some software development/data engineering. This coming January makes my 2 year anniversary at the company and I kind of feel stuck in my career. That being said, I've only ever been ""in the field"" for around 2 years and only this last year or so have I really done a notable amount of software engineering professionally.

It sucks seeing friends and peers making 2 or 3x my salary working (seemingly) SWE jobs they really enjoy. Not that I dislike what I do -- I like coding and solving problems, but I also want to be able to live on my own and not worry how much groceries and everything else will cost. For context, I'm 24 and live with my parents in a HCOL midwestern city where I make \~63k gross a year. I know it's \~technically\~ feasible, but budgeting for rent takes a bunch away from how much I can save and invest for the future, but that's deserving of it's own thread.

Right now I'm working on an internal app to help manage some of our internal services and contributing to our (separate) developing data pipeline. The internal app is an initiative I started because I saw how long it would take to make changes to those services without an app and wanted to change that. So I'm doing basically full stack dev & data engineering, without much guidance (which I think kind of sucks for someone with my level of experience). It's nice because I can make a lot of mistakes, learn from them, and have the freedom to use whatever tech I want so long as it gets the job done. But it also kind of sucks because I don't always know if what I'm doing follows standard conventions, translates to future jobs, creates transferrable skills, etc.

My main gripe with what I do now is that it doesn't seem like we don't use 'industry standard' architectures, workflows, patterns, technologies, etc, making it hard to apply what I've learned on the job here to experience I can confidently place on my resume and talk about for another SWE job. It kind of feels like a amalgamation of technical debt barely making it by (with the exception of the aforementioned internal app -- I'm trying really hard to enforce what I know of as good practices and making a 'good app'. Or at least as good as I know how to). I'd give an example but it would need to be very specific and anyone that works at my company would immediately know I'm writing this and I'd like to stay anonymous.

The company, from what I gather, doesn't bring in a ton of revenue and talks about promotion were answered with a ""likely title adjustment"" to fit my new responsibilities and a ""possible salary adjustment"". So I've been trying to find a new, better paying job since I've got a bit of experience now. I've had mixed results, getting a few phone screenings, 1 OA, 1 take home, and making it to the final round for one company (but getting rejected).

This all being said, I'm not sure how to advance my career from here. On one hand, I'm early into my career, work remotely at a pretty chill company. On the other, I might be here until I retire unless I do something. Out of work, I've made it a habit to do leetcode everyday so at least I'm prepared for one aspect of the interviewing process (it's been helpful in keeping myself accountable and continuing my learning). I'm not sure if recruiters look at Github portfolios, so I'm not sure if it's worth pursuing a portfolio project unless it's something monumental. I have some basic web apps like a to-do app and weather app that everyone does, so I don't think those are going to hold much weight. I've thought about getting some certifications to potentially boost my chances of getting an interview, which seems like the best bang for the buck out of all of these (at least time wise) but correct me if I'm wrong.

I guess I have a few questions:

1. What should I do to make make my resume stand out more since I don't have much experience? Apart from this job, I have one internship where I frankly didn't accomplish much even if I was able to code. Should I look into getting certified? Create portfolio projects? (do recruiters even look at those still?)
2. Should I just stick it out and hope for the best? That the company will turn around and maybe I'll get more relevant experience I can add to my resume? Or hope that my responsibilities will encompass more SWE in the future and I can get a raise or more experience?
3. Should I just keep applying to jobs and Leetcoding?

It's been really tough for me to balance all of these things, so I'm wondering if anyone's been in a similar position that maybe can advise me to focus on just one of these? Or something else? Not sure how to take my career from here to be honest. It's all so overwhelming.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!😊I'm happy to try and clarify if I was unclear about anything.

What would you all do in this situation?

The pay for the one I got is incredible, especially for the area I'll be living in. The one I am still interviewing for would be in Austin and is the field I would want to end up in, pretty much a single step under my dream job. The big issue is that I already accepted the first offer as there was a tight timeline for Spring and leaving them would likely end up with me blacklisted from a lot of possible jobs in the future, should I still do that last interview and then depending on the offer go with it?

careerguidance,1gp5cv2,What different field can I get into with a psychology degree?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gp5cv2/what_different_field_can_i_get_into_with_a/,1,"Hi, I'm currently going through a midlife crisis on what to do next with my life.

I am currently 26 years old, and graduated with a bachelors in general Psychology back in 2020. For the past 3 years I have been an ABA behavior therapist making 30/hr at an autism clinic. The problem I have is this is a dead end job in terms of progression and salary, unless I go to grad school and become a BCBA which I have no interest in becoming as I am currently burnout with ABA.

The pay is average but there is no longer room for progress anymore and hours are inconsistent if clients cancel their sessions, and is not enough if I want to afford a house and family someday. 

I don't really have passions in life. What gets me excited is finding ways to be more efficient and effective in the things that I do, do in life. Whether it’s playing basketball or video games, I like the part where I'm familiar with basketball and video games but then finding ways on how I can be better. I like to self-reflect and watch videos of other people playing and determine what makes them good at the game that I'm not doing and then implement it into my own play.

In my free time I would flip clothes for extra income. I liked the process of buying poly mailers (instead of using cardboard boxes) or using a thermal printer for the labels (instead of a ink printer and cutting it out and using tape)  to cut down the cost and be more efficient with my time and money. Essentially I like the part after the initial fast learning curve, where learning slows down and I have to find ways to learn to do better in something, ultimately to make the task easier. 

My previous experiences are relating to being a teacher assistant, tutor, advisor and counselor for a college-prep program for high school students, which though I somewhat enjoyed, it’s not something I financially enjoyed.  

I had no research internships while pursuing my degree and did not learn how to use R studio while in school. I was an average student with average grades. Because of my age, I know I will do better in my classes and be more proactive if I were to go back to school. 

I want to break into a different field but am unsure where to start with a psychology degree. I am open to going for a 2nd bachelor's degree or getting a masters in something else to help reset my career. 

I have looked into non-psych related fields such as ME/EE engineering, computer science, statistics, cybersecurity, nursing, finance and accounting

And somewhat psych related fields such as Industrial Organizational Psychology and UX Researcher/designer but have read people are struggling to find work in these areas 

Preferably my ideal job would be a stable field where I am able to make 100k after a few years of experience (3-5 years), and potential opportunities to work remotely down the line of my career (though not required). If possible also a field that has a cap of around 130-150k. 

Computer science would make sense but I’m aware that an entry level position extremely competitive atm

As of right now either ME or EE engineering makes the most sense to me but wanted to hear from other people's opinion, even though I would be 30-31 by the time I finish my degree. Are there other options I can go into that would be a better use of my time instead of pursuing a 4 year bachelors over again.

I want to know what are my options for any non-psych masters program that would take someone with a psych background and if not what bachelor degree would you guys recommend that are available that would provide a stable income. 

Thank you",2024-11-11 22:35:48

However, I’ve recently learned about medical illustration and it has intrigued me because it’s art but also in the medical field. Both career paths are sciency yet also artsy so I don’t really know what I should pursue. I want to consider job enjoyment and salary. I have pros and cons for both paths and I just wanted to see if anyone has any strong opinions on what I should (or shouldn’t) pursue. Also I have no clue what subreddit I should’ve posted this in 💀💀

Industrial Design
Pros:
- I have a family friend who is in this field and that gives me a lot of advice
- It’s what I’ve been mostly focusing on
- I like designing my own products and sharing my ideas with others
- I want to go to Georgia Tech (and they have this major)
Cons:
- pays less than medical illustrator (I may be mistaken)
- more competitive ??

Medical Illustration
Pros:
- pays more ??
- I think this job intrigued me because I’m a very artistic person but I’ve also been into science. Also I’ve also kinda wanted to be in the medical field(?)
- my mom would like it lol
- more niche job (?)
Cons:
- the only AP science I’ve taken is AP Physics 1 (no AP Bio but I’m planning on taking Anatomy and Physiology Honors or AP if collegeboard comes out with it)
- I’ve just learned about it so I don’t have a lot of information on it
- I don’t know what college I would go to (I want to stay in-state)

Overall I’m quite literally 50/50 on this choice because I see myself enjoying both paths. I don’t favor over the other (for now) and I just wanted to see what would be better for me in the long run. Also I think as I research more about medical illustration I’ll be able to know what I want to do but just wanted to see what anyone else thought.",2024-11-11 22:50:17
careerguidance,1gpah9e,"A few specific questions based on the careers I show interest in, also what else should I know?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gpah9e/a_few_specific_questions_based_on_the_careers_i/,0,"# feel free to answer if you aren't Australian, but let me know in your reply :)

Finishing my final year of high school this Friday, I need advice on these areas I'm showing interest in

**Media**

To be specific when I say I'd like to work in the media industry I mean either tv/film or journalism.  
For tv/film I wouldn't mind either working somewhere in the film production itself or even as a writer, I have lots of social issues I care deeply about, and I believe being a writer would help get these out there.  
My questions are: What Jobs are available? How easy is it to find a job? What is the pay like?

**Neurology**

As someone with ASD and ADHD, I want to help those that are struggling with ASD, ADHD and many more issues, I feel like not enough is truly being done for many diagnosable issues.  
My questions are: What pathway would I have to take? How difficult is it to find a job?

**Computer Science**

Specifically, I want to work as a software engineer but if needed then I could shift to a different focus in the field.  
My questions are: Is it really as hard to get a job as people say? Is it a stable job?

**Engineering**

I love problem solving and coming up with new things, and I love being able to create things with function. But like I've mentioned I have ASD and ADHD, and I have heard there is an insane workload involved in Engineering.  
As for the specific field of Engineering I would like to get into, I am not entirely sure but I'm thinking either computer networks or something to do with robotics.  
My questions are: Will I realistically be able to keep up with the workload? And if I do keep up with the workload then how much time will I have to myself?

**International relations**

I will be completely honest; I do not have much knowledge on what one would do in an international relations based job.  
My questions are: What types of jobs are available? How difficult are they to get into? What can I expect? Will they be boring?",2024-11-12 02:34:21

Please help?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gp5l8f/29_male_stuck_overwhelemed_about_my_career/,2,"The main obstacle right now is I'm content with doing a call center role which I over perform my peers because It's really easy for me. I don't mean to sound arrogant in my work, but I would resolve 50 calls whereas the average peer would do 15 max per day. I don't expect to get anywhere in this company, pretty sure the management doesn't like me and won't give me any raises or promotions. Definitely need to move to a new organisation.



The pay for this job is crap and maybe more suited for someone who had just graduated at 23ish. ($25 NZD per hour). I have graduated from University with degree marketing and information systems. I honestly think I should be earning atleast $35+ NZD per hour. I have friends who have the same exact education level as me, with only majoring difference is they took their chances, while I failed to muster courage and strength take my chances to shoot my shot for a higher paying coporate job.

However, after graduating from university, therew was a period of depression in my life from 23-25 years old, where I didn't work at all, I mustered enough emotional strength to get a job at a call centre, which I have been working ever since then.

After enough time to recover to become a human being,  I realized that I have been low balling myself all this time 
 by staying at this dead end job where my talents arent' fully utilized and rewarded, which I fully take on responsibility and blame for this because I do admit I am afraid of the big coporate world.

I can live like this a hermit in this dead end job, but I honestly feel like I'm losing so much money via me not taking these open opportunties to advance my career. I need to set up soon and start my career which i think I honestly deserve not due to arrogance but with honest comparisons with people who earn in a higher bracket than I currently am.

I feel like an idiot, and infact am an idiot for not being able to over come these emotional limiting beliefs about myself, so I don't take this job.. or that job.. and settle for something easy. I need a wake up call...

I hope someone with lots of experience in the field of work can share me with some advice or insights around this career mishap.",2024-11-11 22:45:37

I’m 33 in the uk. I run my father’s business a popular restaurant. The money is good but reached a point in my life where I get no fulfilment from it. I would love a career change and I’m not overly passionate about what I change to.

They advertised the role as remote, but over time insisted on relocation. I really didn't like the concept of relocating to such a remote and cold part of the US (and didn't like their evolving expectations), so I sat on the offer while I was interviewing for other opportunities. They eventually rescinded their offer.

Many people advised me that I shouldn't take the offer, and I myself thought I had a real chance of finding something much better in my city by October, so I didn't see the loss of the offer as a big deal.

Suffice it to say that it's now November, and I have yet to get another offer since that one. I'm now thinking that I made a big mistake and should have just taken it and relocated. I tried reaching out the company earlier this month, to no response. I just now schedule sent another email to a different contact I have at the company, hoping they'll accept my apology for insisting on remote work and extend the offer once again. Though, frankly, they advertised the role as remote, so I'm not sure what I'm really apologizing for. But I also just need employment, I don't care about who's in the right and who's in the wrong right now.

I'm having serious doubts that I'll be able to secure employment before the New Year. It's incredibly despiriting, especially seeing all my old coworkers secure new roles. I'm coming up on 8 months unemployed... I just feel like I blew what may have been my only lifeline.

I don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying all the standard advice for job searching, and it was successful once. So I know my methods aren't completely terrible, but it's been 2 months since my last offer.

People I've shown my resume to say it's just fine. I'm networking and reaching out to people I know whose companies are hiring. 

I've fumbled technical interviews that just reinforce my previous doubts in myself as to whether I'm really capable as an engineer. I'm second guessing myself hard right now. I feel foolish for believing that I could do better than what I was offered.",2024-11-12 01:09:39

I graduated from a top public university in spring 2023 with my bachelors in Data Science. I came out of school with subpar grades (\~3.1 gpa) but several internships mainly at startups and mid-sized companies (3 in software engineering and 1 in technical consulting). I had a full time offer in San Francisco for technical consulting but fast forward to November of 2023, after the offer's start date had gotten delayed once, it finally got rescinded. I re-recruited hard and now am a Data Analyst at a mid-sized government accounting firm.

I'm unsure what path I want to go down in my career (software engineering, data analysis/science, or finance) and I'm struggling figuring out my passion is career-wise. I've been debating applying to Master's programs, but with my subpar gpa and few people to give out letters of recommendation, my options for schools dwindle dramatically. I'd want to go to a Master's program that isn't necessarily prestigious, but has good name value for CS ideally.

I took this current job after a 6 months just to desperately take anything. However, while they said this job was marketing, and I confirmed before I came to my current company that it wasn't a sales job, I have been writing their sales pitches.

I have never done sales or sales pitches before AND they want me to do this within their framework. It's also a startup company. Every day is a living hell. I didn't want to be the sole person responsible for their business expansion (they've had about 2 years of only having one major client now and pressure is on every day to get new clients). There is a team overseas, but they expect me to be able to work on my own, but I could have really used a mentor here...

I was put on a PIP which the term of it ended but I haven't heard back my results. I think they will fire me in December, though. They don't like my work.

I have had a long career of job hopping, but I did stay at jobs with companies who had larger teams and were more established. These past two jobs have been startup-ish companies, a ton of responsiblity was put at my feet...and I've choked.

I have looked so hard to find something else a bit more in my lane, but have failed to find something else in the year of searching now. I got to the final round with 4 interviews this past month all to either get ghosted or passed over for another candidate.

Hi, first off i have been looking for a new remote position for just over a year and a half and have had some health problems arise and I lost my previous job about 13 months ago. I want to find a job that utilizes the things that I love to do but I have no idea how to find these jobs nor what they could be called. So here is me, I apologize for the length. I have so many interests and transferable skills/experience that it's hard to summerize it all.

I've worked various rolls over 14 working years and have over 20 years of transferable skills for experience. I love to work with databases and would love to work with animals or in healthcare. I excel in roles that work with the public but am no longer looking to work with the public as it has become too toxic and detrimental to my mental and physical health. I've been the primary appointment setter for my family since I was a teenager and work with budgets often in my personal life. Spreadsheets and being a ""detective"" are 2 of my favorite things to do and get paid for would be a plus. I have a smattering of tech experience basically i only call technicians when they are necessary and the process goes past the ""turn it on and then off again"" or the first like 5 steps on a techs list of questions to ask. I have adhd which I use to my advantage when researching it doing ""detective"" work. I say it like this as that was how finding the cause of an issue was posed to me at my last employer and it stuck. I have a personal background with medical records/coding and billing procedures and finding the right codes for various situations, but lack the certifications needed to work in this field I also am exceptionally passionate about. 

My main interests outside work are video games, Sailor Moon, art, camping, music, and horses. 

I have always had a hard time figuring out what I ""wanted to be when I grew up"" that I really just worked and went with the flow for most of my early working years that while I have many years of total experience I've always started in an entry level position and just as I was ready to be promoted I'd be passed over or life would step in and I either left the role or got let go.

For the first year I was really doing that but after a devastating rejection I gave up on applying and just worked my IT jobs hoping to get a promotion or upskilled (1.5 years somewhere, 1.5 years somewhere else) but inflation/cost of living caught up with my stagnating wage so I had to move back in with my parents.

I'm so far divorced from my graduation date that I don't think any company would (or should) take a chance on me short of some savant work or contribution to a project.

careerguidance,1gp6yn6,Title Change Necessary? Grant Writer to Grant Manager,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gp6yn6/title_change_necessary_grant_writer_to_grant/,0,"I am at a midsize nonprofit in CA, USA working as a grant writer. During the interview process it was made clear to me that the organization currently has someone in a Grant Management type position who the company would eventually be parting ways with. The time has now come that the Grant Manager is leaving, so I will be taking on all of their work (workload is definitely more that I was anticipating), in addition to my current responsibilities. I was under the assumption that once this person has transitioned out, my title should change to reflect my new responsibilities - but I was informed that a title change will not be necessary.

Obviously their hesitancy to change my title is due to the fact that the Grant Manager title would typically come with a pay increase. I think their argument would be that during the interview process, they made it clear that this position would eventually take on these responsibilities, and my current job description already includes the grant management responsibilities. From my perspective, the reason that the title was not originally listed as Grant Manager, was simply because someone else was already holding that title, and that person was not aware that they were going to be replaced.

Also, pay aside, they'd be updating the internal policies to reflect ""Grant Writer"" as the official title - which just feels disingenuous? Like in the future if they're hiring someone new for this role, I just really don't feel like Grant Writer fully captures what this role is...

Is the title worth fighting for?

TLDR: I was hired as a grant writer knowing I'd eventually take on the responsibilities of the Grant Manager. Now that that is happening, should I fight harder for a title change from Grant Writer to Grant Manager?",2024-11-11 23:45:14

However, I feel I am bringing these feelings on myself. The store itself is not a place, I get along with the coworkers just fine, and they're not as strict on time. My hours aren't even as bad as others too, with clocking in everyday at 7 but some days I get to leave at 12, others at 2.

However, I feel that I am missing the motivation to stay. For some reason, these past few days have been unpleasant. It's not the physical labor itself, but it's the physical exhaustion from doing something I'm not motivated to do, even though I still do it.

If this adds anything, I still haven't received my first paycheck yet as they do one of those things where they hold it for my first week of working and add the hours to my next week. I am supposed to get it this Thursday and I am hoping that can change my perspective of things.

So far l've only worked 5 work days and I am already feeling like this. I would hate to throw in the towel this early in knowing that fact, but it's honestly very tempting and I need almost anything that'll help motivate me to stick around for a bit longer.

He currently makes pretty good money doing it since he gets a night shift differential, but would like a more stimulating and better playing job in the coming years. (Inb4 anyone accuses me of trying to change him, this was all his idea, and he asked me for help/support, and I have his permission to share this. He read it over.)

Ideally it would be a job in the same hospital network so he can keep his earned PTO, benefits, and make use of the tuition reimbursement they offer. (I also work for the empire and did a similar thing a few years ago for nursing school and the tuition benefit is legit.)

He doesn't think he'd be a good nurse/MA/CNA, and he doesn't love the idea of coding/programming/CS because he'd rather not sit at a desk all day. Maybe IT would suit him? He also doesn't think he'd be happy with a physical trade since he previously took HVAC courses but didn't like it and chose not to finish the program. He doesn't like taking things apart. 

He has been considering radiology tech, but is somewhat concerned about the math courses as this is not one of his strong points. (I am trying to build his confidence in this area since I went through the same thing, but ultimately got a B in college algebra with lots of studying and some tutoring. I know we're not the same person but I believe in him and his brain is very big.) 

I guess some other roles to be considered are respiratory therapist, lab tech, surgical tech, PT assistant, and anything else with an associates or shorter course of study - he thinks four years of study is too long, especially since he'll have to work while he's in school. If you have any of the above jobs or similar, please share pros and cons! Open to non-clinical roles as well. The hospital network also has outpatient clinics, physical therapy centers, offices, etc. It's huge.

He is very frugal and his home will be paid off by the end of next year, but he wants a job with good earning potential and in which he can put his sharp mind to use. He is very intellectually curious and probably reads 30-40 books a year. He loves history, making music, martial arts, old weaponry, and old ships... though now I'm realizing these things may not have anything to do with working in healthcare, haha.",2024-11-11 22:15:41

I currently work an internship at an investment firm which has potential to go full time but that depends on factors beyond my control. Its my 2nd internship in the field. I thoroughly enjoy the work and its my desire to continue building my career in venture capital or launch a startup.

My overall work experience is quite varied, holding positions such as business analyst, program manager and business operations associate along with the usual grunt gigs such as Amazon and UPS. I'm also competent in a variety of CRM/SaaS such as Salesforce, Excel and Tableau and to some extent programming in SQL and Python. Top it all off with sporadic freelance consulting for startups seeking  funding and running a small e-commerce operation on eBay.

A jack of all trades profile.

However, i've experienced an abundance of struggles too such as constant bouts of un/underemployment, working for free or being grossly underpaid by industry standard to the extent I was scammed but needed the experience. I've had good jobs but many of them were achieved via nepotism or just sheer luck. Its not how I want to continue my career development and its tiring constantly having to switch jobs. I still live at home because i've yet to build a stable career that will enable me to move out.

I also have ADD and Auditory Processing Disorder which makes traditional learning difficult for me especially anything math heavy or otherwise highly technical as I have no attention to details. I cannot pass math no matter regardless of effort. Not even college algebra.  I'm good at language arts, history and liberal arts but no desire to major in those. Law and accounting have garnered my attention but due to my ADD those fields probably aren't viable. 

Therefore, i'm wondering if going back to school would make sense? I already have ample experience. None of my ""talents"" translate into a profitable degree and to be frank, no degree honestly piques my interests. I have ZERO desire to go back to school and shell out a five figure sum just for the sake of checking off a box on the ATS. However, i've been routinely skipped over during the final interview for candidates with less than half the experience I offer but that person has a degree. This has occurred dozens of times and oftentimes, i'm forced to take a job I don't want simply because I was the only half decent candidate that applied. I'm conflicted as I want to advance and succeed but I don't want to go through the trouble of college. I just simply don't have the drive, patience or aptitude for formal education. However, if there is truly no other way forward, I suppose I have little choice. I'll be 36/37 when I finally finish since I would only attend part-time. UGH!!!!

I was interested in cars and thought about automotive engineering, but nearby universities didn’t have good programs, and finances were tight.

I graduated with a GPA of 2.29/4.00, managed to land a field service engineer role at a multinational healthcare manufacturer (probably due to my personality!), and three years later, I’m earning significantly more than most people my age in the Middle East. I don’t necessarily hate the job, but I’m not sure I want to do it for the rest of my life.

But, like most realizations in my life, it feels a bit late: about two years into the job, I developed a serious interest in aviation. At first, I thought it was a phase, but my passion for it has only grown. Now, I’m thinking about going back to school for an aviation-related degree.

However, I have a lot of concerns:

	1.	Is starting fresh in a new field worth it, given my current income?

	2.	Would anyone hire me in aviation with my low GPA and no industry experience?

The reason this troubles me is a) this was not disclosed upfront, or even shared until I dug for an answer, and b) **I am planning to leave this company before April 2025, and when I asked if earned bonuses would be paid to people no longer with the company** (we've laid off many, many people this year), **I was told ""no.""** 

If you earn a bonus and it is documented, **isn't it wage theft** to not pay it out even if the employee leaves the company before the payout? Maybe it's not, but this feels really ""off."" I have a wild hunch that my employer is trying to get out of paying bonuses that were earned by and promised to employees...",2024-11-11 21:23:48
careerguidance,1gp3h7j,Semiconductor industry vs biotech/pharma?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gp3h7j/semiconductor_industry_vs_biotechpharma/,0,"Hi! I'm graduating at the end of this year with a degree in chemistry and have recently landed an entry-level technician job in semiconductors. I'm pretty interested in the field, especially with how much growth there is. However, I'm a bit concerned for my future job growth. If I were to commit to the semiconductor industry given my lack of an engineering degree/knowledge, especially because chemistry isn't even really engineering-adjacent like math and physics are, I feel like I may not be able to get into higher-level engineering positions in the future.

Something more applicable to me/my skillset is the biotech industry or the pharmaceutical industry (which I mostly applied to during my job search), but I'm not sure if it's completely right for me given that the semiconductor field seems to be doing better/is more exciting to me. 

I'd appreciate any insight on which field anyone might recommend, although I know it's a pretty specific question. I'm hopeful that experience in semiconductors may offset the educational requirements for higher-level positions, but I know that realistically, that might not be the case. I just don't want to waste my time in semiconductors if there isn't a good outlook for me and if my time in my early professional career is better spent elsewhere.",2024-11-11 21:17:44

A sector I have always been drawn to (and often discouraged from even attempting, drawing looks of pity/condescension/disgust from those i asked) is tech.

OK, so here's my background: I've been a jack of all trades for most of my life, doing everything from post hurricane debris collection, to massage therapy, to DJing. In 2010, I graduated from EMT school and worked in a variety of healthcare positions as an EMT and later as a paramedic, including on a 911 ambulance, a NICU transport team, and in a correctional facility. COVID pretty much sapped my will to continue in the field, so I walked away. 

Here's where I am now: I got in with a company that provides experts for court cases, among other services (that's the department I work in.) I have a bachelor's degree in Healthcare Administration, and that in conjunction with my experience in the healthcare field landed me a transfer to a role specific to locating and recruiting medical experts for a nationwide panel. Additionally, I have a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.

Here is where I want to be: I would like to be able to use more of the managerial training I received from my education. I enjoy problem solving, seeing things from a higher level to identify problems within an organization's workflow and then working at the ground level to determine solutions.

My question is: What direction should I take with my background and credentials to locate and secure such a position, and are there additional certifications or courses that I should pursue that would help with that goal?",2024-11-11 21:07:15

careerguidance,1goxclc,I feel like I'm wasting my time getting an engineering degree. Where do I go from here?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1goxclc/i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_time_getting_an/,6,"I (21M USA) wasn't the brightest kid in high school. I was slightly above average at best in terms of academics. I've graduated high school with a 3.2 GPA in 2022. I had a fair share of missing assignments and unexcused absences. I took some honors classes, and I've even took an AP class during my senior year. I had an IEP and were given a study hall period. I showed up to classes, paid attention, used my time in study hall to get work done, and caught up on assignments over the weekend. Overall, I took school seriously, but not too serious. I've felt I was held back by the pandemic in 2020.

Right after high school, I've started CC, not because it was my last option but that it was the best option at the time. I went for an engineering degree because it would lead to the most opportunities and highest pay. I grew up in a low-income household, and I wanted to provide a better life for me and my future family. I like the idea of working with Technology/Machinery. I want to learn how computers and robots work. One time, I've built a PC. I'm also the creative type. I like making art and music. I like building and creating stuff. I didn't go for an art or any creative-type degree because of limited income potential. So, engineering made the most sense to me.

College isn't going so smoothly for me. Originally, my plan was to attend C.C. for 3 years (alot of math) to receive my Associates then transfer to University of Florida to complete my bachelor's but ever since, I've started CC, there had been a lot of obstacles and this plan is no longer feasible. I'll be lucky to get my Associates degree after 4 years of CC. Not to mention, with the grades I have now, it is very unlikely I'll get accepted to UF. I got suspended at one point because of bad grades. I might not even get accepted to ANY universities, and I'm worried about what will happen in that case. I was ""gifted"" in math, but now it's bringing me nothing but pain and frustration. I'm worried I'm gonna fail Trigonometry this semester, which will delay my graduation even further. With everything going on the past few years, I'm starting to think I should just drop Engineering and do something else.

Luckily, I have 2 other options that should still help me reach my goals. I won't be making as much as an actual engineer but I wouldn't be struggling either and If I move into a LCOL area or my wife works (which is expected in 2024 anyway), we should still be able to raise a family. These 2 options only require a certificate or Associates degree, so I'll become financially stable sooner, which I feel is becoming important. I haven't worked a job yet because I've been told to focus on my education, and while I was suspended, I was technically an NEET. I'm also not sure I can handle another 4 years of college anyway. I thought college was supposed to be fun, but I'm just struggling. Where's the fun? I feel like I need to switch to one of these 2 options for the sake of my mental health. No amount of money is worth sacrificing my sanity and mental health long-term.

So, the way I see it, I have 3 options for the rest of my life.

1.) Complete my A.A. engineering degree at CC and try to get into a university to complete my bachelor's.

2.) Switch to an A.S. Applied Engineering Technology degree and complete it at CC.

3.) Drop out of CC entirely and transfer to National Aviation Academy to get my A & P certificate.

What would you do if you're in my situation? Which options do you recommend? Is there something I'm missing?",2024-11-11 17:12:23

I just graduated last year and landed my second job. I don't have much experience with negotiating employment contracts, so I am posting here to get some serious help...

First, during the interview, the hiring manager said for the first 'couple of months' I would need to virtually come in everyday into the office (I am in civil engineering so I must conduct site visits and also to learn company processes in person), but after that, I can change to a hybrid work model. Should I be requesting this to be outlined in the contract?

Next, it says on the vacation section, that I will have two weeks vacation after my first year of service, unless approved otherwise. Would it be appropriate to ask them for vacation accrual during the first year of service on my contract as well? (This is kind of a deal breaker for me)

Additionally, they are asking me to start in one month (I told them this is my notice period for my current job), but I realized I may need some more time to relocate.

Finally, they are asking me to come into the office so that we can sign the contract together, after showing me around. But I live over 2 hours away and have already taken a massive vacation recently. So I am not so sure what to do here.

careerguidance,1gp21iq,Advice: New Grad (22F) feeling discouraged by tech - Should I start fresh somewhere else?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gp21iq/advice_new_grad_22f_feeling_discouraged_by_tech/,2,"


Hello! I’m seeking some career advice. 

I’m a 2024 Grad seeking full time roles in Product and UX Design. It’s pretty clear that this industry is over saturated. I worked towards this career for my 4 years of undergrad, and I’ve been searching for about 2.5 months now and it only fills me with immense anxiety and hopelessness. 

I love UX Design. I discovered it my freshman year and absolutely loved it. I’m a very people-centered creative person so this felt like the perfect career for me and I enjoy the entire design process. I know I haven’t been searching for long, but the job search ruins my spirits. Even if I switch into, let’s say, Product Management, I just feel like Tech will never feel stable (though someone please prove me wrong). Especially in comparison to healthcare. 

I keep thinking:
What if i never get a job? What if I experience layoffs my entire career? 

Should I keep searching for a little bit and then pursue another career? Will I have to accept failure?

I went to a very prestigious undergrad which makes me feel very unsuccessful in comparison to my peers. Even most of my close friends are pre-med, so they never have to worry about this job search as they are all planning their next 10 years very easily. My friends who are not pre-med already have post grad jobs or are working on getting further education. My corporate peers on LinkedIn work in prestigious companies and I just feel horrible. My peers who studied UX Design right next to me in college have full time roles. 

I know, I know. Comparison is the thief of joy, but whenever it feels like everyone around me and everyone who I went to school with is succeeding, I feel horrible about myself. 

I’m only a few months post grad, but I know these feelings will get worse as time goes on. 

I started looking into stable jobs that don’t require lots of further education like MRI Tech or Rad Tech. (Send other careers you can think of pls). 

I could see myself enjoying these, though it obviously wasn’t my first choice. I’m very smart and very motivated, so school wouldn’t be a problem, I think. I’m a people person and I strive for work-life balance. 

Oh, that’s another thing. I’m confident that my boyfriend and I will last until marriage and beyond. I don’t think it’s naive, we are very mature and strong. He’s going to med school next year, so a lot of our relationship will depend on where school and his career leads him. 

So when I think about going into MRI Tech or something, I know we will have an even MORE compatible relationship because we are both in healthcare. 

I said before, I’m a very creative person, so even though I created this life plan in my head where my job will have to be creative, I know that if I work in healthcare, I’ll be creative outside of my job (hobbies,etc). I had this vision for my life where I’ll work in a cool tech company and be able to live in awesome cities and travel and live this epic life, but now I’m not so sure. 

I can probably life in awesome cities and travel and live an epic life with a non-tech job right? And have my creative fulfilling hobbies on the side. 

I just don’t know what to do. I knew your 20s were full of questioning, but wow. I feel like I’m in the middle of writing out my life, but I have no idea what to do. 

I know we are little ants on a floating rock, but I still gotta figure out my damn life! 


So, if you’ve read this far, give me ANY advice you have. Give me advice on life, design, healthcare, relationships, etc. Tell me your life story or literally anything you want to tell me. 

Edit:
Forgot to include that I’m POC, First Gen, Low Income. I don’t really want to work blue-collar nor make my money solely through side hustles. College was important for me because my parents never got to go, so I have a sense of urgency in it paying off. I think I’m more passionate about living a good and happy life with stable income than I am passionate about being passionate about my career. ",2024-11-11 20:20:09

I am 22F, recently graduated this May with a degree in Performance Theatre. Now trust me when I say, I do not regret going to college or doing everything I did while I was there. I learned so much from it, and I also hold a minor in Sociology and graduated with Honors. All stuff I am insanely grateful for and very proud of.

However, about midway through my senior year, I began feeling extremely burnt out and lost all the love I had for performing. The department I was in wasn’t particularly great for a multitude of reasons, I was surrounded by people who I thought fueled my fire, but in reality just drained it. I began going to the gym about a year before this and it became a game-changer for my happiness and mental health. So this is what I started leaning into. I got to the point where I wanted to try personal training, stepped into an internship for about 3 weeks near the end of my senior year and dropped it because the workload was too much and it didn’t feel like my cup of tea. I tried to gain my passion for performing back but it came and went and just never felt the same.

All that goes to say, it is now November and I am getting certified as a CPT AND CNC through NASM, but am starting to feel disinterested towards fitness as a career path as well. It’s seeming like it will not pay much better than what I do now (waiting tables!!) I keep trying to figure out why I don’t want to do it anymore, whether it’s the emotional rollercoaster I’ve been on in my relationship since I graduated, post-grad depression in general, or just a feeling of imposter syndrome because I feel like I got a useless degree and now I’m trying to delve into something that I don’t know a lot about. I always worked insanely hard at everything I did in high school and all of that drive just died after I left college. I want it back but I want to do something different for a career.

I can tell it has caused him anxiety that I seem lost and don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore.

I originally picked this course because I'll admit, the high paycheck it can potentially bring blinded me, and also I underestimated how this course would actually drain me because back then I thought I would like it or thought it would be different. The longer I stay here the more I seemingly lose passion for it if theres any more left. I always wonder if its going to be like this for college then why would it be different in an actual workplace, or worse I might hate it in an actual job more and Im going to spend the res of my days being miserable . My passion revolves around more of in the arts and design direction, but I initially turned away from it because I was scared of how companies would not hire anyone with those kinds of degrees because of the rampant AI trend thats been going about as of late, so I went with a tech course so I can secure a future as Ive said before.

So I would like to ask some advice or at least maybe hear out someone here with maybe a similar experience. Should I just stay in my course now even tho Im starting to hate it because no matter how much I might despise a future I can have with this course, at least I still might have a future, or should I shift courses to be in a field I actually like but run the risk of not having a career when I graduate because its not as steady as the previous one?

Hi everyone!

I (M30) work for a AI Automation Tech Company as a CSM and manage a portfolio of 136 clients with combined $250,000 MRR.

I’ve been here for nearly two years and my company is a global one that owns 4 different solutions (Software/Service)

Two of them are in AI automation and after a year and a half on the first solution, they called me for a meeting and said they want to move me to the second solution where I’ll manage little bit less but much higher MRR customers.

I will still be a CSM but now all our meetings are directly with leadership and higher ups as the customers are higher value. My team lead is also coming with me and apperantly after they offered him this position and needed a CSM to join him, he selected me. 

February is my performance review, currently we’re on budget freeze so I can’t get a raise with this move but it will be considered during my performance review and potential raise.

When that time comes, I will have experience and knowledge in two solution and managed two portfolios.

The issue is, my company pays CSM in US much more than in Canada bc they pay based on your region and expected expenses. 

The pay is good overall and so are benefits but I am thinking is it better to stay and hope having this new experience will give me better career options within company in a year or two, or should I leave and look for a company that will pay me more but have to start working my way up from scratch?

Keep in mind my current company prefers and actively promotes from within. Everyone with 2-3 year experience has already been promoted. And even with 1.5 year experience I already got a raise last year (inflation matched) and they want me to work higher valued customers. 

I see bright future here but need to make sure I make enough to provide my family good life.

Mid 30’s corporate bro, fully remote WFH, sending emails and virtual meetings all day basically, currently making a salary of 145k effectively from my PJs at home 

For the past several years I’ve had this nagging thought in my head that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life… no one as a kid ever told their parents “when I grow up I want to work on a laptop all day” 

I’ve been debating on the ability to become a commercial pilot, as something with “more meaning” to life then the 9-5 corporate grind 

Here’s the problem - I am not a pilot, I have never flown (in command) and I have exactly 0 flight hours, no pilots license, no nothing 

My educational background is a bachelors in business and an MBA - but nothing aviation related

From my understanding potential pilots typically start there careers in their early 20s flying Cessnas around, then corporate / private jets, then regional carriers then lastly the “big name” companies after they have accumulated literally thousands upon thousands of flight hours 

The logical part of me says bro… your already mid 30s, that ship has sailed, this is not a realistic time to start a career at zero when your going up against 19 year olds with more flight hours then you have 

Additionally income… I have a family and am the primary breadwinner, additionally as I stated earlier I’m already at a comfy 6 figure income… I don’t know what entry level pilots make but I doubt it’s equivalent right out of the gate - so my entire lifestyle would ultimately suffer

As the title suggests, I am wondering if my “dream” career is too niche.

I am faced with 2 problems: 

A) I don’t exactly know the specific path I should follow to get myself into the position I want

B) I don’t know if what I want is even a viable career in terms of actually making enough money to live a comfortable life.

I have a bachelors degree in Visual/Spatial design. I plan to do my masters in Landscape Architecture (if it aligns with what I want to achieve) 

My career goals lie within landscape architecture, however I want my career to be about more. My passions include landscape architecture, reclaiming old/abandoned buildings and turning them into community hubs/markets/art museums/residential spaces/cafes/restaurants, and indoor & outdoor garden spaces using native plant life (public and private). The two key things for me is the reclamation of old buildings and landscape architecture. 

I like the idea of being able to be apart of both processes. First being designing and planning, second being actually getting involved physically whether that be demolishing, tiling, cement rendering, planting, etc. I understand these physical skills are that of a landscaper, which is something I am thinking about, but another HUGE goal of mine is to be able to travel the world working in this industry, understanding the local area and activating a space for an area in need. I don’t believe this is possible as a landscaper.

An example of the kind of work I am talking about is seen in Kuala Lumpur. “Rex KL” was an abandoned theatre now turned book store/market space. 

I have spent the past 2 years of my life travelling the world, I have seen plenty of inspiration and I know that this is what I want to do.

About a month ago, I was accepted for a post that pays roughly £2400 per month and requires me to work in the role for 3 years. The first year has a course integrated and would be physically and time-wise demanding. I have to stick in the role for 3 years to compensate for the cost of the course.

The reason I want a certificate is because regardless of going to business school for my degree, I only know surface level info when it comes to accounting. 

Considering I have a Student Loan from SK, does anyone know what would happen if I apply gor student loans in a different province? I convocated last June.

careerguidance,1gox8pr,Should I plan to stick it out? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gox8pr/should_i_plan_to_stick_it_out/,2,"I have worked for the same company since I graduated from college. First as an intern, then as a customer service rep, now I am in an entry-level HR position (I went to school for HR management). I joined HR in 2022 and my job description entails handling employee inquiries and serving back-up to Payroll. 

My job duties have widely expanded since then but my job description (and pay grade) has not changed. I am now proficient in payroll processing, have taken over leave administration, oversee HR compliance with immigration and I-9 processing, unemployment claims, workers compensation, ADA, handle the day-to-day employee and stakeholder inquiries, learning and development support, and assist with employee relations-related issues/tasks. 

I was paid a retention bonus to agree to stay within the division for one year. I plan to fulfill my contract. Since I have signed the contract, there have been many changes (both good and bad). Ultimately, I am not seeing any opportunity for growth. It also appears I am the go-to for the scut work nobody else wants. I am consistently provided with good feedback and ratings, but my compensation says otherwise. I have brought this up to my manager several times but doesn’t seem to go anywhere. 

I don’t know whether I should stick it out to gain those “years” of experience for my resume, or if I should plan to look elsewhere as soon as my contract is up. At what point is someone no longer considered “entry level”? I am struggling with this. Thanks for any thoughts/guidance/feedback.

careerguidance,1gox3yg,Am I in the wrong here? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gox3yg/am_i_in_the_wrong_here/,0,"
I work for a governmental department, and I have for the most part enjoy my job. 

It's very easy going, I get to make my own schedule and I get to kind of figure out what to do day in and day out as long as the work gets done correctly they don't care. 

HOWEVER, there have been some instances at work that make me feel that my boss is playing favorites with the other coworkers. 

For some context, my boss started off as boots on the ground and then her boss got promoted up as an assistant director leaving a vacant spot for the managerial position. It took some convincing, but she eventually took the position. When she became a manager, she became a manager over her now once coworkers. Those coworkers are senior inspectors now, and for the most part have been staying status quo till a group of employees retired and they needed to hire new staff.  

Fast forward now two years later, I've noticed that certain coworkers get special privileges that I don't get. For example, they have told me how to manipulate the time sheets to say an inspection took more time than it actually did and be done with their full shift earlier than the full time. I don't really care but what bothered me is that they make it a joke that they ""leave early"". There was one time where I was accused of leaving early and I that's when I lost it and told her and basically squealed on what people are doing. She mentioned that she was going to talk to her boss and send an email out to a team but she didn't do it. I have one of the county vehicles that can also be used for others because it's a Prius and fuel efficient. I got in trouble the other day for having it a little bit messy and then my boss mentioned that her boss said that she was going to have to start doing spot checks for all her employees. My boss said she was going to email the team but she never did.

 I understand and own that I make mistakes, but the problem that I have with my manager is that it feels like she's too afraid to reprimand her senior inspectors and allow them to come and go as they please because they were once her friends/coworkers. What do I do in this situation? I have one employee who gets to telecommute in such a way that they get paid to commute to work because we have to be in the office in ""two hours"" if needed. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I getting frustrated for no reason. Like I feel like there is special treatment for others and not for me and I'm not sure how to navigate this space. My boss doesn't do anything to follow up on policies to make it uniform. I am getting tired of seeing her pick on me to enforce politics while other employees are able to just do what they want.

I declined a raise at my old job because I was severely overworked and even with the new raise, I would be underpaid. I resigned and accepted a new position at a start up company.
The new position pays well, but there is no culture.
They don't have a solid list of services that they offer, which makes it hard to do my job because I'm in marketing. They have the funding from a large parent company but no leadership to guide the company. In the 2 months that l've been here, many executive leaders have ""moved on"" in the middle of the night, the strategy of the company has changed, entire departments have been fired or moved back to the parent company, and my manager sucks.
When I started there were over 250 employees and now it's down to the 170s.


I am so unhappy here. The commute is so long, I  don't like the people, and bc I'm not sure what the company does, it makes it hard to do my job. The office is proactively empty because they’ve fired everyone and all the roles they’re hiring for are virtual. I asked my manager to move to a more remote schedule and she refused. 

I've been looking for new remote only jobs (without including the current role on my resume) and secretly hoping that the company would just collapse already and fire me (bc the parent company has an established marketing team and wouldn't need me).

Before that, I had some part-time non-corporate jobs with super-flexible schedules, and to be fair, I loved what I was doing, but the pay was not great and I definitely needed to move to a full-time job. So I started working for a company. 

But I feel like it is sucking the life out of me. I became so obsessed with waiting for weekends and they seem to be my only relief now. The job is not necessarily hard (I manage to do my tasks pretty well, and there are some overtime hours on certain busy days, but not that much), my manager likes me, praises me, and generally people around me treat me well. There's some stress here and there, but I don't think that's the cause of my lack of motivation and purpose. 

However, doing the same thing (or almost the same thing) basically every day makes me lose any motivation I might have. I wake up every morning thinking about how I don't want to start working on my tasks - even though I always finish on time and with the expected quality. Furthermore I hate the strict 9-5 schedule, because I am forced to work on these certain hours (at my previous part-time jobs I used to pretty much make my own schedule). Working from home probably contributes to this, as I don't talk to my co-workers very much, and to be fair, I'm a pretty outgoing person. 

For reference, I have always thought about becoming a teacher, but to be fair I never really pursued it and I feel it would be a bit late now as I would need to do an extra two years of studies in my country to become one.

I am not sure if corporate life is for me or not. Has anyone faced the same problem? If so, what are your tips? ",2024-11-11 17:00:23

I (28f) am currently in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some advice. I’ve been unemployed for about two months after quitting my job to spend the summer working a seasonal job (best summer ever and no regrets), and while I’m not in immediate financial need, I would like to have something lined up by the new year.

I’ve been looking for positions in fields outside of the service industry, but so far I haven’t had any luck. I have worked as a restaurant and event manager for the past five years. I recently received an offer for a restaurant manager job. The problem is, I'm not thrilled about the role or the idea of going back into that type of work due to the physical demands and schedule aspect, but it’s an offer on the table.

I don’t want to get stuck in a job I’m not happy with, or worse, waste anyone’s time, including my own. Plus, this job is in my current city, which I do not want to stay in long-term. I know it’s better to have some income rather than none, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel stuck in a job that doesn’t align with my goals (which honestly, I am still trying to figure out), especially if it could delay my chances of finding something more in line with my long-term career.

So, I’m asking for advice: Should I take this offer or hold out longer for something that fits better with my interests and future plans? Any experiences or insights you can share would be really appreciated!

Now I know illegal substance study must be approved by the federal government, but how might I prepare myself to enter that field? Would it be considered ethnobotony? Psychopharmacology? Like what would that study be and what would be the best way to get involved?

And on a final note; please understand i don't want to get into it to take drugs. I've already had my own experiences with some and plan to with others.

I’m a **7th-semester mechanical engineering student**, and I’m at a crossroads with my career decisions.

On one hand, I’m considering preparing for the **GATE exam** to pursue a stable job in a **Public Sector Undertaking (PSU)**, which offers job security and steady growth or MNC's. On the other hand, the **software development** field is growing rapidly and offers higher salaries, which is really tempting.

Since the pandemic, I’ve been learning coding on my own—working with **web scraping**, **data crawling**, and **algorithmic trading**. While it's been interesting, I haven’t made much money from these projects. I’ve also tried **stock and cryptocurrency trading**, but I’m not sure if this is the right path for me long-term.

At the same time, I’m considering that the **number of Software Development Engineers (SDEs)** is rapidly increasing, and with the market getting **saturated**, this could lead to **layoffs** and slower **salary growth**. Additionally, the rise of **AI** continues to change the landscape, automating many tasks that were previously done by humans (although I know it also creates new roles).

With **6 months of free time** during my 8th semester, I’m unsure whether to focus on **GATE prep for a PSU job** or dive deeper into **software development**.

My questions are:

1. Should I prioritize **GATE prep** and aim for a stable PSU job, or should I pivot to **software development**?
2. Can I balance **mechanical engineering** with **software development**, or should I specialize in just one?
3. How can I best use the next **6 months** to set myself up for a successful career?

I’m looking for some advice on navigating my HR career. I’ve held three different HR roles since 2022 and earned my MBA in HRM in 2021. I genuinely love the HR field—events, engagement, and helping people are my passion. But my recent experiences have been challenging, especially with company cultures and lack of support.

Here’s a quick background on my journey so far:
	1.	HR Generalist 2 – Had very inadequate training and felt unsupported.
	2.	People Services Specialist at a tech company – I enjoyed the work but was seriously overworked. I had to handle back-up duties for India orientation despite the 6-hour time difference, and even when I requested support, there was no one to share the load.
	3.	HR Coordinator – My current role. I enjoy the day-to-day HR tasks, but the company culture is really getting to me.

The company I’m with now has some red flags. They’ve gone through three different HR Directors recently, and I’m starting to see why. Leadership often hires friends as managers, gives them director-level pay, and structures things in Workday so their true reporting lines are hidden, allowing them to make double what their managers think. The lack of transparency and favoritism is unsettling. I also want to note they are paying for VPs to have brand new cars but struggle to keep employees with a minimum of $15 for full time. 

I feel like I’ve found my footing in terms of the type of HR work I enjoy, but I don’t think I can thrive in such a toxic environment. Would it be worth it to invest in my SHRM certification to help with my exit strategy, or should I start looking to move without it? Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has advice on navigating toxic workplaces in HR.

My mom always told me I was born to do great things. She always made the joke that I was born during an active lightning strike on a stormy evening. My personality matches, as I am a fiery, spunky woman who just wants to give love and show others their worth. I lost my mom this year. I always wanted to prove she was right. 

My greatest asset, I believe, is communicating/networking face to face. I've been told many times that I can ""talk to a doorknob"". I would love to use my skills and pursue a career in such environment. 

When I was a child, I would sell lemonade any time I needed money to do something. I grew up poor, but my mom would have given it to me anyways (depending). Being the stubborn, ambitious, curious girl, I wanted to see how much I could make. I wanted to be able to pay for all of my friends to go to the public pool in our small town. My mom was always impressed as to how much I would make. So I turned it into a game for myself. Each time I made more than the last by incorporating new ideas. 

I know I need to network, whether it is through a luxury bar, event, fundraiser, etc. 

I'm unsure how far this thread will reach, but is there anyone out there willing to connect with me? I would love to learn how you have achieved success.

Hello! I posted this over in construction but also was looking to get some feedback here for anyone willing to lend a hand. I’m trying to break into the construction industry after being in hospitality and sales for a decade. I’m trying to get an entry level position. After send out over 100 CVs, I got a meeting with a guy who has a company doing window and door installs.

I went out to the job site to shadow and though in the short term I would be able to get skills and income, that it’s probably not the best move. It would be more of a tangential step imo. Without any sort of structure, advancement within the industry seems like a hard sell there.

I’m looking to work into a foreman position and work up to either superintendent, project manager or an estimator role in the future. I do have a bachelors in business but since I have no experience, my plan is to get my OSHA 10 and start as a general laborer or admin and work my way up. However, I’ve sent out over 100 CVs for entry level and haven’t heard anything back. My guess is my resume gets filtered out because there’s no experience that translates to construction. 

I’ve read a lot of stories about how people walk on to job sites looking for work but that looks/ sounds like a recipe for disaster. However, I was wondering if cold calling various GCs in my area and explaining my situation might give me a better chance to start at the ground level. 

Anyway, any feedback or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",2024-11-11 15:26:00

I had all kind of titles and job responsibilities, even managerial level positions but since it's a third world country the pay is peanuts compared to other countries. Many big firms outsource their work to my country and of course they greatly lower their costs by doing so.



Honestly, I find it unfair that for the same position I'm paid less than my foreign counterparts when I literally have more job responsibilities. Example, since I'm Bilingual (Like everybody in my country), we get more work to do. The excuse is the ""Cost of living"" but in reality, the cost of living is higher when comparing the pay to cost of living ratio.



So my question is, how do I get hired remotely or for offshore work from my location? I tried Linkedin, Indeed etc but some revert back saying that the position's salary will not be paid in USD/CAD/AUD whatever, because of my current location and as such, they will pay in my country's currency and at a reduced amount, resulting in the same salary we get over here.



Any help to this question would be appreciated.

I haven’t since I started it 5 months ago. I have around 6 years of work experience but this was my first experience in this particular industry (news) and while I thought I would love it, I’ve realized it’s not a good choice for me long term. The hours are crazy, there’s constant breaking news, the pay is low, and I’m constantly having to consume news and I didn’t realize how much all of those things would affect me.

I’ve been applying to non-news jobs and I received an offer for a role that’s way better suited for me. The hours are normal, the pay is better, and I get to do more than sit at a desk all day. I accepted the offer and told them I’d have to give my current employer two weeks notice.

My team is small so I figured it’d be respectful to inform my manager before going to HR so I gave her a call and kept it straightforward but vague. I just said that I didn’t think the industry is for me and I want to pursue other opportunities that are better aligned with my long term goals so I’d be putting in my two week notice, but didn’t get to mention I already have a new job lined up because she immediately starts going on about “I don’t think you’ve thought this through, you haven’t given it enough time, the job market is terrible right now, no one is hiring, why don’t you give it until January (my six month mark) and reevaluate.” I was caught off guard so I kind of just said okay let’s talk in January. I went to the new employer and told them my current employer has asked me to stay until the new year and they were very understanding and updated my offer for a start date of January. 

I’m absolutely still leaving my current role but my question is how to approach my manager. I gave her the courtesy of a phone call this first time but given that she tried to talk me out of it, I’m thinking of just sending an email two weeks before January and saying “I’ve given it more thought like you said and I still feel the same way. I also have a position lined up, so this will be my official two week notice.” 

I’m trying not to burn my bridges with this company because 5-6 months feels long enough to leave this role on my resume and it’d be really good to have on there but my manager’s comments felt a little condescending and I’d like to avoid a repeat of that. I understand she might’ve been trying to genuinely give me advice, but I’m not a naive kid. I was at my job before this one for 3 years and I plan to stay at this new job at least a year, if not longer, so my resume will be fine.

I’m not trying to give up art, I don’t even know if I could do that, but if I have to work to support myself, I’d rather go do a masters or potentially a second undergrad (they’re cheap here) and train for a career instead of doing menial jobs for years.

I'm getting decent grades in them, but I don't feel particularly interested in them or motivated to continue studying this pathway. So I am considering switching my major to business degree or general studies.

 

I have been looking into other administrative careers such as public policy, insurance, insurance, Healthcare or business administration. But I still feel lost at what to decide on. 

 

I am currently doing a remote administrative internship. I feel that I have gained some experience but no marketable skills. However, it has made me interested in hospitality management or logistics/event management.

 

My current concern now is that with the election over, I feel that social work isn't a viable career option anymore as people are predicting budget cuts for various programs funded by the state and federal government and stopping various assistance programs and grants, i.e., Medicare and SNAPS.

 

I had wanted to become a macro social worker due to the fact that it focuses on the administrative side of social work and organization. I am not interested in counseling, as I feel that it would too tasking on my mental state and providing comfort/advice to people has never been my strong suit.

 

Current Aim: My main goal is to have a bachelor degree in a career that allows me to work for a few years, save up money, and go to college for more knowledge in the field (master's or doctorate) or provide me with skills that I can transfer to another job or career field. 

 

I would appreciate any advice from social workers with bachelor degrees and other professionals who work in business administration or related fields. 

 

To summarize: I just want to know what bachelor degree would be best for someone in my position, or are there other options I am ignoring or have knowledge of that can help decide what to study?

Is it a bad idea?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gor1xb/taking_a_gap_year_after_getting_my_bachelors/,5,"Hey guys. I’m almost done with university(thank God). These four were TOUGH. I mean it. After high school I wanted to take a gap year because of the stress I went through for these years especially in 12th grade when my grandma suffered a stroke and i had to be a caregiver. Taking care of her and studying for exams took a tool on me. I wanted to take a gap year but my parents were against that. “You will forget how to study.”(I never knew how to) “You will get comfortable and won’t bother to go to university.” and so on. Now I wish i took a gap year. University was very tough. The amount of material I studied in school for 2
semester was the amount of material I studied for one semester. Semesters were shorter in university as well. I got burned out so quickly but i pushed myself and i kept on pushing. I still do. I sacrificed my sleep, my free time, my physical attractiveness and so on. It was the most depressing and stressful time of my life. I want a break after I graduate. During that time I am planning to

- Get two tooth refills and maybe one filling

- Start going to the gym again

- Get my body in shape again

- Read more books i am interested in

- Play video games without feeling guilty for not studying(I do it once a month now for like 2 hours)

-Relax.

I feel like my parents would call me lazy. But i will work until I die after that so does it matter? The retirement age here is 65 but it gets increased every few months(the average lifespan is like 71-73years too). I will get two weeks off a year if the employer even feels like giving me my whole break. If at my future job we are understaffed then nope. My mom got only 5 days off this year. They put her vacation days in her days off(somedays she has 3 days off and one of them counts as vacation leave💀). I know i will be fucked up like that so I want 1 year to enjoy life before i slave away the rest of it. 

I am scared this will hurt my resume though. I have experience. I worked during the summers in my field and i have savings. I am afraid my need for break would give me harder time finding a job. What should i do?",2024-11-11 12:29:05

I have been doing computer science for a year and have hated every minute of it, so I think it's time to change.

My parents are fine with this, however they (especially my dad) are certain I won't make enough or any money to survive. I know psychology makes very little money off the bat compared to computer science, however, I would still like to give it a shot. They are very against this reasoning since I am doing something risky without knowing if I truly want to commit to it or not.

I honestly would've liked to move out so I can do my own thing but I live in the bay area where rent is 4k a month, even if I worked part time (which I'm not) that wouldn't be enough to pay for rent alone forget other bills. I want to move out of here eventually so that shouldn't be a factor once I graduate.

Is there another major you guys would recommend instead? One that I can move to psychology from after? My sister said I can do any other major and try psychology later but I should have a backup. The only problem is I don't know what else I'm interested in. And I don't want to say ""I don't know what I'm interested in"" because then my parents will choose for me.

I think they will let me do psychology if I'm hellbent on it and they will pay for it all too but they won't be supportive, since they are against it.

My dad is high up in a startup and he oversees some employment and has employed others that have majored in lower income jobs like psychology and sociology. One of the people he accepted, their alternative was a barista at Starbucks. For these reasons he is very against me doing psychology, and even if he was supportive I don't know if that home environment would be a very productive one.

careerguidance,1gopnck,Should I Transition to DevOps or Keep Pursuing Backend Roles? Feeling Stuck in career trap.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gopnck/should_i_transition_to_devops_or_keep_pursuing/,0,"Hey everyone!

I'm a backend developer with about four years of experience, and I'm in a bit of a career dilemma. For context, here’s a breakdown of my experience:

**First 2 Years:** I worked with Java and Spring Boot on a groupware service backend. My main responsibilities were service logic development, domain modeling, and addressing operational issues—mostly core backend work.

**Next Year:** I transitioned to using Golang to develop multi-cloud platform features. This role focused more on subsystem feature development for a multi-cloud environment and internal CI/CD pipeline tasks. Rather than working on an active service, I was involved in developing open-source features and handling DevOps tasks within the team.

**Recent Twist:** I recently received a proposal to shift entirely into DevOps based on some internal CI/CD work I did that was well-received. With an upcoming reorganization, my team thinks I’d be a good fit for a dedicated DevOps role.

The thing is, I’ve been preparing for a job change over the last three months because of my current work. I've applied to a few backend positions, had some interviews, but unfortunately, haven’t landed an offer yet. I'm targeting backend development roles, but I can’t help feeling that my career path is a bit all over the place.

I worry that my skills seem too scattered. I have:

* **Java & Spring Boot (2 years)** but no experience with high-traffic or complex ops issues.
* **Golang & CI/CD (1 year)** but it’s relatively shallow, and not enough to stand out as a backend specialist.

I didn’t get significant salary raises during these years, and I feel like my tech stack and skills are all over the place—Java here, Go there, some DevOps on the side. Nothing feels deep, and I haven’t “dug deep” into any one area to build a strong professional identity.

So now, I’m wondering:

1. **Should I shift into DevOps and build up that experience?** On the one hand, it's a skillset that’s in demand, but I lack a strong foundation and would essentially be starting over. There’s also no guarantee this shift would even come with a salary adjustment.
2. **Or should I keep looking for backend roles, even if it takes more time?** The problem is, I'm worried about becoming a ""jack of all trades, master of none,"" especially if this DevOps work ends up diluting my backend experience further.

At the same time, I don’t want to waste more time stuck in a role that might not lead anywhere or just be “filler” work that doesn’t get me closer to my backend goals.

Any advice on how to approach this? Would a pivot to DevOps add value to my skillset, or would it make my career path even more convoluted? Thanks in advance for any insights or similar experiences—really looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",2024-11-11 11:00:15

I’d love your advice on a career decision.

I’m looking for some guidance on a potential career switch and would love to hear insights from people who might have been through something similar or have experience in the field.

# Background:

* I have a bachelor’s degree in biology and a strong foundation in scientific research and analytical skills.
* Recently, I’ve developed an interest in software engineering and am considering pursuing a master’s degree in the field.
* I don’t have a formal background in programming, though I’ve started learning some basics on my own.

# My Questions:

1. **Is a master’s in software engineering worth it for someone with my background?** Is it realistic to expect to find job opportunities as a software engineer or in a related tech field afterward?
2. **Would I be at a disadvantage in a master’s program compared to students with a computer science background?** Would I need to do additional prep work, like learning certain programming languages or completing specific coursework?
3. **Are there alternative paths to break into software engineering without a master’s degree?** For example, would a coding bootcamp, self-study, or a certificate program provide enough skills and credibility to land a job?
4. **Are there specific master’s programs that cater to career switchers, especially those who come from scientific backgrounds?**
5. **Long-term outlook:** For those who’ve made this switch, do you find it rewarding in terms of job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and salary?

Thank you in advance for any advice or insights! I’m really curious to know if others have taken a similar path and whether it’s worth the time and financial investment to get a master’s degree in software engineering.",2024-11-11 09:21:38

Last Friday, I had a difficult conversation with my manager about a disciplinary issue involving me in the office. For some time, I’d been dealing with an employee (c-suite level, but works alongside me) who was responsible for significant tasks but often avoided the work, pushing it onto me instead. Unfortunately, it went further—there were troubling signs that this employee had been mismanaging resources, possibly even embezzling funds (of a few crores). They wanted me to work under them and keep my mouth shut, but I raised it on email and asked them to not bother with my responsibilities. This exchange eventually landed in the CEO’s inbox, who then passed it along to my manager. Thankfully, my manager was supportive, offering advice on handling situations like this more strategically in the future.

However, this incident was only the tip of the iceberg. My manager doesn’t work directly in my office, so he’s not fully aware of the daily dynamics here. This employee’s behavior goes beyond avoiding work; there’s a strong undertone of discrimination, especially against women. He has openly made comments like, “I don’t want women in this office” and has specifically blocked female candidates from being hired under various pretexts (the recruiters will support if I ask them for evidence) His influence is significant in the office, and despite multiple complaints and instances of biased behavior, leadership has taken no action, possibly due to his seniority and age. 

The overall environment has only added to the discomfort. It’s not uncommon to witness verbal clashes among leadership, complete with shouting and cursing.

I had already drafted a resignation letter, but Friday’s events solidified my resolve. Saturday, I recently received an offer from another organization with a 30% salary increase. It’s an opportunity for a fresh start in a (hopefully) healthier work environment.

Now, I’m preparing to hand in my resignation, feeling both determined and apprehensive about facing the CEO, the leadership,aand the problem employee

1.) It's wfo day tomorrow. How do I go in and adress this person, if at all? 
2.)I enjoyed working with my boss, but this office is not it for me. How do I part way without any issues? 

TL;DR
An employee at my current workplace has been avoiding responsibilities, passing tasks onto me, and displaying discriminatory behavior, particularly against women. Leadership is aware but won’t act due to the employee’s age. A disciplinary incident last Friday reaffirmed my concerns, and Saturday since accepted an offer with a 30% salary increase. I’m planning to resign but feel uneasy about facing the leadership and this employee in person tomorrow.",2024-11-10 15:21:26

This wouldn't be that big of a problem usually but I have no interests other than my hobbies, which I can't physically do full time, and I'm not the brightest bulb in the box, which limits me considerably.

Any help would be highly appreciated! 

If you need any more info about any of my previous jobs, qualifications or anything, feel free to ask. ",2024-11-11 04:18:15

Please leave your opinion/suggestions!,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gon9vb/am_i_at_the_right_path_please_leave_your/,0,"I am a 22-year-old male from a small town in India. I have a younger sibling and my mother and my father in our family. Currently, my situation is lost, and I am not able to get a clear vision of how I should continue my life and how I should go on a track. For everyone to understand, I will quickly explain my life till now. My school went well; I was an average student. After school, I decided to continue junior engineering, which is known in India as Polytechnic Diploma diploma. For that, I left my hometown and went to a place that was a bit far from my hometown. But I didn't get the college I wanted because of my low grades. My parents never interfered in my decisions; they had always let me do what I wanted (I sometimes think that is the fault I lack). After six months of college, the pandemic started, and I was back in my home. All classes were going online; I neither attended classes nor studied the whole pandemic. I lost interest in what I was trying to be. At that time, with one of my friends, I started filmaking and started earning a small amount of money, and I was happy with it. As time passed, the pandemic was over and colleges were opened, but I didn't attend classes, which led me to have lower attendance, and I was not able to sit for the examination. After that, I lied to my parents that I just got backlogged in 1 subject, so I will not sit in exams. I will take online courses and try to get a job. I somehow convinced them. They agreed to it. I took online classes a few days were good, but then I again got some money through different part-time work and lost my interest in learning coding. After that, I got into a call center because relatives were starting to ask what I was doing or planning for. I started searching for any work and got a call center job. I didn't let anyone know that I worked in a call center; I told them it's some kind of office work. Now, I have left that work and have started again my coding journey. In March 2024, I started to develop my physique as I was obese. I lost 22 kg in 4 months. I started learning web development in July. Till now I have completed my HTML and CSS, all from free YouTube tutorials, playlists, etc. Started javascript just a few days ago. I used to have some break in between, like 4-5 days for some relaxation or some outing with family or friends. Now I have only an aim to just get a good job in the web development field or as any coder to make my parents proud. Now the thing is, why have I told you all this? This is because I wanted to tell you how my life is going and if I am on the right path or if you have any suggestions you want to give me. Please reply with some comments; I will be very happy. I can't discuss this with my friends or my family.",2024-11-11 08:03:45

Throughout college I poured all my focus into my career, I did multiple high paying internships and after college I landed a high paying job. Recently I’ve been feeling extremely disengaged with work. Quite frankly I just want a change of scenery and some time to focus on my wellbeing. I’m still extremely passionate about my career and what I do, I just don’t think my current job is really fulfilling.

One aspect that I feel guilty about is that this might set me back financially a bit. I have about 120k across my accounts and I have no debt whatsoever. My monthly expenses run my about ~3k. On paper it seems financially responsible but because of my surroundings peers and upbringing a small part of me still thinks this is a bad financial decision.

My plan is to spend 3 months to just reset and focus on my physical and mental health. I want to just spend time doing things I enjoy like cooking, reading, running, exploring this new city I moved to and work on side projects just for the fun of it.

All my friends and colleagues are extremely supportive about this. However, this still seems like such a foreign idea, I see people take career breaks mid career but never so early into their careers. Am I delusional or crazy for wanting to do this?",2024-11-10 06:51:09

I started to learn coding by myself 4 months ago and I really love it. Its annoying at times when I don’t understand the code but learning it is really fun and interesting to do.

However, from my time in college and from different research experiences, I have realized that I hate research and would like to avoid years of research if possible. My lack of love for research kind of limits me in what programs I can do, as many programs for psychology or therapy revolve around research in some capacity (at least in the US). Due to this, I really don't know what I want to do when I graduate or what programs would be good for my interests. Any help or advise would be amazing, thank you in advance.

Activities not preferred: dealing with confrontation, deep emotional involvement(empathy is a great element to have, but it shouldn't be central to my role), event planning (too many complex parts to manage, high reliance on other elements)

So I feel like I have 2 choices 

1. Get into project management by doing certificate etc and get a job here in India which is not my preference 

2. Do masters in mba or business analysis from abroad and then do jobs but it’s gonna take my year and also I won’t be earning and the risk that comes with it

Apple machine learning engineer:
- austin, tx
- total annual comp: ~162k
- under the finance/ops org (related to fraud detection) 
- part of a rotational program within that org that focuses on different areas of fraud detection
- pros: i interned there last summer and really enjoyed my experience, the teams + everyone i met in the org were amazing, decent wlb, the role is explicitly machine learning, interesting domain and projects
- cons: not sure if there’s much growth, you’re pretty limited to your org bc of how secretive apple is, org is only based in austin + seattle, might be pigeonholed into classical ml roles/fraud domain, not as much variety in work

Meta software engineer:
- menlo park, ca
- total annual comp: ~182k
- haven’t done team matching yet so not sure what i would be working on
- pros: faster career growth, more opportunities for lateral switches to different teams, much more flexibility with locations, bay area, more variety in projects/teams
- cons: job security, idk what work + team culture is like, potentially bad wlb, harder to switch into an explicitly ML role later since its general swe

beyond info about the role itself, in terms of location i would probably prefer bay area because ive been in texas all my life so i want to live somewhere else, my bf will potentially be in bay area full time, better weather, and generally just ~recent politics~

I’ve taken a practice LSAT cold, and got a 150. I do plan to study more to apply next cycle (and so teach one more year).

I’m looking for advice from HR professionals or hiring managers, especially those in healthcare or mental health fields.

I’m currently updating my resume for roles in mental health and substance use counseling. My background includes client-centered mental health work (trauma-informed care, crisis intervention, community resource coordination), and I’m close to finishing a Master’s in Counseling. Over the past five years, I’ve worked in mental health roles off and on, including positions in clinical support and management at treatment centers.

However, from 2014 to 2019, my primary focus was running my own short-term rental management and consultancy business. I started the business from scratch, eventually generating $60K in net revenue by 2019. I handled everything independently, from client relationships and financial management to marketing and operations.

I’m considering adding this experience under “Professional Experience” on my resume, but I’m unsure if it’s relevant enough or if it might distract from my clinical background. I’m especially concerned that, because I was self-employed, it could detract from the impact of my other roles in mental health.

On one hand, I think it highlights my skills in client management, organization, and adaptability, which could be relevant in a clinician role. But I’m also weighing whether it might shift too much focus away from my mental health experience.

Would including this add value from a hiring perspective, given that it was my full-time work during that period? Or is it better to leave it off and keep the focus squarely on my clinical experience? I’d love to hear your thoughts—thanks in advance!",2024-11-11 01:03:50

Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice on a career decision I’m facing.

A bit of background: I’ve always wanted to work in the U.S., so over the past year, I’ve been practicing for American tech interviews, focusing on LeetCode (around 600 problems) and system design. My goal is to join a U.S.-based company here in Australia and eventually transfer to the U.S. So far, I’ve applied to seven companies, and Amazon is the only one where I’ve made it to the interview stage.

Meanwhile, I received an “exceeds expectations” rating in my current job’s performance review. My manager hinted that another strong year could put me in a good position for promotion, and they’re planning to involve me in some high-complexity projects to show I’m ready for a senior role.

There’s also the matter of my visa status. My company is sponsoring me for permanent residency, and I should be eligible for Australian citizenship by 2027, allowing me to apply for an E-3 visa for the U.S. This means staying with my current company, gaining a promotion, and making the U.S. move in a few years is an option.

Given this, I’m considering three options:

1. Focus entirely on my current job to secure the promotion. A senior title might help me switch later, but I worry that waiting until 2027 might be taking the long route.

2. Continue balancing work and interview prep as I have been. This way, I can pursue both promotion and external opportunities, but I’m concerned about potentially not excelling in either area.

3. Quit my current job to dedicate myself fully to interview prep. But I’m worried about limited U.S. company opportunities in Australia, a potentially long job search, and missing out on the promotion.

Since this is a big decision, I’d really appreciate any advice or insights, especially from people with experience in similar situations or those working in U.S. tech companies. Thanks so much!",2024-11-11 04:33:50

I am seeking suggestions for companies in the US  that hire individuals to work with people with special needs and/or disabilities. Currently, I work in healthcare technology, but I have always had a passion for serving this population, which is near and dear to my heart. I’m looking for a more fulfilling role where I can make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

While I’m not sure what specific job opportunities exist in this field, for context, I have an MBA and have worked in healthcare for the past four years. I believe I would thrive in an administrative role within this sector. Although I don’t have a clinical background and may not have direct interaction with individuals, I do have relevant experience through volunteering with several organizations and personal experience with a family member. 

Ideally, I'm looking for a fully remote role, as that's my current situation. I understand this may make the search more challenging, but I require the flexibility to manage a cancer diagnosis at a young age. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",2024-11-11 04:04:47

Im currently a brewing associate at a midsized contract brewery in new England. I have about 3 years brewing experience which when boiled down is essentially manufacturing expensive. I operate heavy machinery - steam/glycol insulated vessels, centrifugal pumps, centrifuge, heat exchangers, etc. I have learned a ton about maintenance and working and fixing general plumbing, electric, and fixing machines. I like my job, but Im moving on to greener$ passages. Ive already decided to leave the brewing world, im just alittle stuck on where to go. 

I have 2 ideas that have stuck with me. The main one being biotech/pharmaceuticals. I live outside of boston which is a massive biotech hub. I think i can get a maintenance or manufacturing job (entry level) pretty easily since i basically have experience there, just not GMP experience. But I figure if I can get my foot in the door I can move up pretty quickly over the years. 

The other one is becoming a ""stationary engineer"", basically a boiler operator. Getting my firemans license and moving up that direction. It would be alittle trickier to get in, cause i would need to find a job as an unlicensed operator for 1 year before sitting for the exam and then going from there. I am currently in charge of the high pressure boilers at my job and have sort of enjoyed learning about them and fixing things where i can. 

Im having a hard time deciding. Biotech seems like the obvious choice, plus I actually have a bachelor's in biology lol. But im nervous that I will be stuck in manufacturing and be stuck making mediocre money. ",2024-11-11 03:23:04

I've only ever worked physical construction jobs in high school and during college, however I just got my first ""entry career"" job as a bank teller. I'll have full benefits with PTO and a set Monday thru Friday 9-5 schedule. They'll also be paying $5000 a year towards my tuition for me and since I'm a finance major after 6 months of working as a teller I'll be eligible to apply to other roles internally. I'll get to shadow any departments at the bank I'd like and once I get my degree I'll likely be able to be promoted assuming I'm not already promoted before I graduate. The only caveat is starting out my pay is $17.50/ hour.

I've been comparing myself to my buddies who went the trade route and I'm feeling super behind. My buddies who are all the same age as me are making much more than me doing construction. For example one friend is in the elevator union and he's making over $50/hour as an apprentice. Another buddy started at an HVAC company 2 years ago and his starting wage as an apprentice with no experience was $24/hr. Fast forward to today he's making $44/hr.

Like I said I've only ever worked physical jobs in construction and landscaping my whole life and I like being physically active however I know deep down I'm doing the right thing for my future and how my body will thank me. I enjoy finance and find it interesting and this job is an incredible opportunity that will almost guarantee me a career once I graduate.

I don't think this reflects the broadness of the role and I'm afraid it might lead to me being pigeonholed. If I'm co-leading with someone with a PM title, it feels weird.

The job does annual raises and my first year I was provided the highest possible, 10%. Over year 2, my timeliness fell to the wayside, this was due to family issues and they’ve been conveyed with the job clearly. Over the course of the second year, my general treatment from management has also shifted, I went from being an office favorite by all, to essentially what feels an example. My remote day was taken, (I do 3 13’s so this honestly was a make or break for me), my shift was forcibly moved an hour later into the day, and new management has been micromanaging my every move from what used to be quite a self motivated role. Upon the meeting date for my 2 year review, 10 minutes after my start time (I’m fully dressed for a review/interview), I was told the date was being moved to the next day due to a tour of the building. Rubbed wrong by this, I still continue my day. Later around 3pmish, I’m told to come to an office. I find myself sitting with a manager as well as an HR member having me sign my final write up due to my timeliness. Completely tipped off at this point. I go on to the next day, head to my review and make a case for my work ethic (which was told to me by the same manager as “on point once here and locked in” it’s just timeliness that’s my problem. (17 instances in a year’s time, either late, left early, or called out). I was told I’m receiving no raise at all, and it would be reviewed in 3 months time. It’s been 4 months. Not to compare, however there are members that will do far less work with much lesser accuracy that still possess their remote day along with having received raises. If my work is to a degree where my name shows and it’s taken as a relief that there won’t be much double checking to do (QC process), I feel as though I should’ve been compensated for this. Even to have met in the middle of where I should have been raised and told the remaining would follow after improvement would’ve provided me more moral than I’m currently with. The job has a high turnover rate now after switching to a more metric focused route and new management, so it’s just been pushing me away entirely. Only thing keeping me here is the lack of an opportunity awaiting me. I want to make my time here at least serve me financially, however I’m taking every step to leave. To add insult to injury, they pulled me in for another meeting to say I should’ve been on FMLA since the beginning and it could’ve prevented a lot of their measures. This again left a terrible taste.

P.s. if you’ve any leads on an I.T. Job, I’d happily send you my resume.

I’m 40 years old, a manager in a major consulting firm, making $143k, and I just got a solid and confirmed offer from a bank for $175k plus a 15% annual bonus (so basically 200k). And yes, these are middle class salaries.

**Here’s the unique and f'd up situation though:**

* I have a conviction for a violent misdemeanor, which makes consulting’s frequent background checks an added stress. Cause a lot of clients will raise a red flag on me. (I didn't actually commit the crime, I got caught up. I pled. Nearly ruined my life). This has not stopped me in any way though. I've constantly gotten promoted.
* Financially, I’m $100k in debt, and I don’t have much saved for retirement, like 50k total. I started late. I'm was a high school drop out, and I was broke as hell until 32 years old (no excuse for the debt though).
* My ultimate goal is to hit millionaire status on paper by 60, and consulting has the very clear potential to get me there—but the higher immediate salary in industry could help with my immediate debt and savings goals right now.

I**f you were in my position, would you stick with consulting for the long-term wealth potential?**

* Mind you, consulting makes you DREAM of the craziest salaries, most of my closest colleagues are all making over 200k (all). But of course it comes with a ton of stress, politics and it takes over your life.
* In the banking/regular job, things are relatively easy, chill even. The salary is decent. But the upward trajectory is uncertain and I'd probably never make 300k - 400k going that route, and I'm going to need a TON of money to catch up.

It feels like a bunch of little stuff has just added up and I called my mom really upset. Everyone in my personal life that I've talked to says that I should quit and come back to my original state. I just feel like such a failure for not being able to stick it out. Like I should have been tougher. My first real attempt at moving away from home didn't work out and I'm really embarrassed. Nobody at my work knows quite yet because I sent the resignation to my manager via email and she isn't in over the weekend. Am I deceiving them? I also had told them that I was going to be staying over the winter and into the summer. I know I shouldn't care what other people think but it's really hard not to. I think it also doesn't help that I work and live in the same building. There is not a lot of separation and my room is in a literal basement. There is a window and it leads to a window well.
So should I feel guilty? What can I do to stop feeling this way? I feel like I've been making myself sick with all of this stress and anxiety.",2024-11-10 19:12:49

Ultimately the game isn't as popular these days and the career in that game is looking slim. I wasted two years playing games every day and failing every class.

That lasted until 2023 when I decided to stop doing Computer science and switched to IT and make a fresh start. That year I got pretty decent grades and did really well at university and passed all my subjects. I don't know what I was thinking but at the start of this year 2024, but I looked at my transcript and was incredibly disappointed at two years' worth of failing the same classes. It depressed me thinking that my future employers will see this university transcript, so I decided to transfer to a better university this year, the best IT university in my city and really got myself on track, did a computer science program got high distinctions all throughout the first semester.

Come second semester and I was looking to be on track, but I got a full time IT job offer in September and have started full time working in IT. So far it's quite enjoyable, the pay is about 70k a year in Australia and for my age, for someone with no qualifications at 22, it isn't bad at all. However with full time work and full time study I've found my studies to have suffered a lot, I passed two subjects this semester with HD however another subject which is a very difficult subject I am looking to maybe, just maybe if I try my very hardest to barely pass.

I am feeling very lost in my life, next year I'll be pretty much a year 2 student at age 22 turning 23 after one semester. I feel so behind, and I know I am so behind. Almost everyone my age already has a degree; I would watch YouTube videos and just randomly search them up and wonder what age they graduated. Oh, what do you know, 22 or 23. I can't help but compare myself and I regret those years I spent wasted so much.

What should I do. Should I forget about work, keep studying and get a degree when I am 24-25, or should I just drop out entirely and work full time. Some people tell me that it might be because I don't enjoy my degree and that could be true, but I feel like at this point I already put too much into it to stop. I never knew what I wanted to do when I was younger, when I was 18 in my high school's career counselling, I only answered IT because at the time it was just a good salary job with good development in the future and it being future proof.

What should someone who wasted so much do in your opinion. Should I switch careers even if I'm not obsessed enough about IT and do something new at 22, is 22 really too late? I know I can really learn and become incredible at something if I become obsessed with it, I became nearly the best in my region at two different games because I got obsessed with them so I just don't know what I'm missing in life and how can I be successful and enjoy living my life.

Looking to register for CFA down the road. Long term goal is to get into corporate banking (ex: portfolio management)

Hi all,

I'm a Canadian currently working as a bank teller in Canada and I wanted to see what my options are in terms of taking the next step in banking. I've been working just under 6 months now, outperforming my targets and units, in hopes of getting a promotion (although promotion doesnt increase my income as much).

I was looking to take the general securities course in Canada (Canadian Securities Course), but saw that the U.S counterpart (SIE), is significantly cheaper to register. The reason why I'm considering taking U.S certification is because the earning potential in the US is just so much more compared to Canada.I also wanted to ask if I should register for CFA after I pass the general securities course. I understand these certifications can open up so much more opportunities, but I also do understand that my current position in banking is the most entry-level, and will take time. I was hoping to seek some guidance on what should my next steps be.

Thank you very much in advance!",2024-11-11 00:27:32

i know that new grads are advised not to take internships, but i wasn't landing anything and i spent four months looking and looking. this internship required two years of relevant experience and a degree, of which I have decent experience and, of course, a degree. i didn't think much of it because post-grad internships are becoming more common but ... yeah. im a grad, and i would've like a permanent position, not an internship.

anyways. i take the offer, it pays $23/hour, it's very convenient for me, life is looking alright. but now im three months into the internship and me and an analyst - one ""step"" above me in the hierarchy - are doing the exact same work. exact same training. granted, they have more work experience than me and they've been in this ultra-specific field for longer, so of course it makes sense they're an analyst and im not.

but. we are doing. THE EXACT SAME WORK. is this normal? and quite frankly, they're given way more grace than me when they fuck up/need more time. literally our manager will be like, ""oh if you feel overwhelmed you should give one of your tasks to the other analysts who've been here longer than you"" to this person. last time i tried to tell my manager when she tried to add another task to my day that i couldn't - im literally drowning in work most days - she was like ""lol no we need you to know how to do this.""

the incentive to work when my colleagues are earning $30/hour while im doing the exact same work for less is low. but i also need to know if im being a bratty little intern who doesn't know how the office works. my previous work experience was very isolated, or i was working with people on my exact professional level, so i don't have anything to compare this to.

am i being snubbed?

additional info if it makes a difference - i cant dox myself but this job is at a respected institution. however, our team specifically has a large turnover issue (a fact i learned after i started working there.) one other team that works under the same department as us is also facing a turnover issue - two people have left from that team because, rumour has it, another team in a closely-related department was putting way too much downward pressure onto them. so far, in the three months ive been here, three people have left.

i feel so naive and stupid right now typing all of this. i dont know if im in the wrong, or if im just whining. again, if anyone could help, or give me advice on the next steps i should take, let me know.",2024-11-10 20:31:07

My first job was very toxic, and I was sexually assaulted after a year. I finally got a new job, hoping it would be a fresh start, as I was going through a lot mentally and physically at the time. Unfortunately, that job was just as bad; I was treated with disrespect, and because I didn’t speak Italian, they let me go. After that, I found another job where I met amazing people, but the company was still toxic, and I ended up getting fired. 

Then the big boss from that company found me on Instagram and tried to chat me up, which was awkward. Eventually, I landed a job I really loved, but then COVID hit, and I was made redundant, back to square one. I had a few temp jobs during lockdown, and when it lifted, I got offered a job that was absolutely amazing. I loved everything about it and received so much praise for my work. However, a year later, new managers came in, and everything changed.

I really wanted to pursue a career managing coffee shops, so I thought I had landed my dream job. However, it turned out to be mentally and physically exhausting; I was only paid £10 hourly for managing a busy coffee shop with no support, not even an assistant manager, and the owner treated me poorly, which forced me to leave. I then found another job, but the owner was deeply in debt with suppliers and consistently paid us late, leaving me no choice but to look for other options. My next job was with toxic coworkers, including bullying, and the owner didn’t care at all.

This month marks one year at this job and they just told me they would be increasing my pay to $21 an hour.

So I do a lot of work and am incredibly busy all the time. Since I have started the team has grown by 2 people so my workload has as well. I get no paid time off, no sick time, no benefits like insurance, 401/ retirement. Due to the type of company benefits like insurance are unable to be offered. I am thinking of countering with $25 an hour. I am okay not getting those benefits but I think because I get none of those things that my base pay needs to makeup for not having them. I realize that is a VERY large jump but I think when you take the benefits and no time off into account that it is justified. I would like $25 so I would like to start high with that but if they counted at $23 I think that would be reasonable as well.

I'm not the smartest person ever but if I assert myself I can exceed. 

I love kids and I love helping them and I tend to do really well with autistic kids which is why special ED and OT are on this list but I am not sure if I'll be able to handle it since it would require a lot of energy and I run out of energy quite quickly 

I love any kind of problem solving and math, I like the technicalities in engineering and engineering is definitely something I would love to persue, I'm just not sure if I could handle it. I know it takes a lot academically and there are some fields which are more difficult than others.
I definitely do not want to do anything mechanical, I really love biomechanical engineering but I simply am not, nor will I ever be smart enough for that.

I am exploring the role of product manager for technology companies. My research and readings have shown me that my skills are directly relevant and transferable to product management and I am getting more motivated to explore further. One of the board members of the nonprofit I work for is a high-ranking person in a technology company and was friendly to me when we met in person recently. I described my role at the nonprofit leading a recent major project and he commented that it sounded like product management. I've sent him a LinkedIn invite. 

Ideally, I'd love to ask for an informational interview with them or their staff member who hold the title of product manager to learn more about the role and to expand my network of contacts in the tech industry. One thing that concerns me a bit is to be approaching someone so high-ranking and well-connected in the upper levels of our organization.

For the past three years I have been serving and bartending which has been awesome for the money from tips, I enjoy my work and love working around other people. I have great interpersonal skills and am good and connecting with my customers and coworkers. I love the thrill of a rush and being busy at work so I don't have the time to be bored. I am super efficient and good when it come to multitasking. I can handle stress well and am able to identify and solve problems when they arise. I also do a lot of modelling outside of working at the restaurant. I pose as a nude model for art studios around my area and have recently gotten into working more with photographers and such. I just bring this up because it highlights my skills in networking and being able to connect with these people and get myself booked for jobs. Also being able to manage my schedule and the time that it takes to get myself booked behind the scenes spending time building my portfolio and writing emails. I'm basically my own manager.

I sold all of my stuff in Canada hopped on a plane and headed to Switzerland in hopes of starting a new chapter of my life. But a few weeks in and I realized that my visa wasn't valid and I had to leave the Schegan area after 90 days.

In the end it was an amazing experience and I learnt a lot and I grew so much as a person and was able to have an idea of what it would be like to live abroad.

So coming back to Canada felt a bit underwhelming and I decided to move from East coast to the West coast to spice things up. It's been quite the experience so far but it's been great and has furthered my independence. Even though I'm here I know this will be temporary and I actually have plans to go to Brazil in February to visit my family. But after Brazil I don't want to come back to Canada. I want to be back Europe, I want to properly apply for a visa and be able to stay there on a more longterm basis. I have an aunt that lives in Spain and was thinking of applying for a visa to stay there with her and learn Spanish and maybe find work. I also want to go back to Switzerland and want to figure out how I can live there on a longterm basis.

This is where the whole school thing comes in. I want to go to school, even do an online course just to get a degree and get it over with. I just don't know what it is I want to study, and I don't want to pick something and invest my time in something useless. I want a degree that can help me find a job that fits with my interests and allows me to travel the world. I don't want to ever work a mundane job, I love excitement and the thrill of trying something new and being spontaneous. But I also don't want to waste these years and have to worry about this further down the line. I also want to make money. I want to have financial freedom and be able to travel and have all of these experiences. I just need to go to school get a degree. I was thinking of online school so I can do a Canadian school that gives me coverage with OSAP but also I would love to go to an actual school somewhere in Europe but that's a bit too expensive.

Anyways if you read through this thank you. Just share any ideas you have or advice for someone in my situation. Also everything I do is fully funded by myself when it comes to travelling and paying my bills and tuition for school, I receive no help from my parents. So budget friendly ideas and pathways are welcome.

Small company with about 50 corporate folks, it’s e-commerce driven direct to consumer company. Been there for just over six months, my six month review I got high remarks and my boss seems to like me.

I was brought in under the marketing team to better understand our consumers and strategize we can target them better in paid media and sponsorships. Since joining a consumer insights leader was added, as well as someone in finance specifically to understand marketing.

I don’t believe these are direct reflection of my performance, the consumer insights VP job was posted when I applied. And the finance role was mentioned to me when I started that “you’ll be working closely with the finance person when they are hired.”

In a larger organization all three roles could coexist, and probably could here as well but there seems to be no swimlanes.

I was doing great job, impressing leadership, then a higher level person comes in and as expected does better then me and is presenting to leadership what I used to just a quarter or two ago.

I don’t believe they are trying to replace me and think this is case of private equity throwing money at their new investment (just bought the company this spring) to ramp up efforts. 

So:
- how do I work on developing swimlanes with those above me?
- the new hires are much smarter then me and much more experience, how can I do my best to hang with them and not let them run all over my work?

I do not have a trust fund or any money dedicated to college. Parents never went to college either. I'm currently looking for other career paths that could be good. I've been thinking about things I hyperfixate on a lot.

Even though neither me or my parents make enough money to go on vacation, I've spent hours of my free time before (often in single 9 hour sittings) researching and calculating not only the costs of a trip, but also the time of year, how many people, low budget to high budget, how to get the most of your money, and the many different avenues I could take to save up for all of those scenarios (and a lot more). It's all very fun for me, even if I know it's something I'll never do. This doesn't just go for vacations however, also cars, homes, weddings, birthdays, businesses, lots and lots of things. 

Typing this out almost makes me think of an event planner? (Don't know why I didn't think of this before?) Especially because I also enjoy coordinating things with others, and visualizing stuff, but I do not know how much they make and I'm really trying to go into a middle class/upper middle class career so I can provide for my family and loved ones who do not have that life. I may have to look into it more after posting this!

I've heard accountant, mathematician, engineer, but I don't really know what they do exactly? Even with the research I have done, none of it makes sense to me... Accounting doesn't seem very fun (at least in my terms of math fun), mathematician is very broad and I'd be afraid of messing up something important, engineer also seems very broad and as much as I love calculating things (not even limited to budgeting but many other math things) I don't think I'm smart enough to become an engineer, nor have that kind of self confidence. More information on any of these would be nice!! Especially if anyone has any ideas of specific jobs within these fields are similar to what I already enjoy doing! 

I just really like math, budgeting, problem solving, planning, I don't know it's all very nice but also very idealistic. It also doesn't just have to pertain to planning events or budgeting (though they are my favorites), I just really like calculating things with math in general, finding solutions and/or answers is very rewarding for me! 

Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated!! Thank you and have a great day!! :]

Right now, I have a part-time job in public relations with a professional sports team that pays $18 an hour for every home game. There’s approx. 40 games from now until April. I also am working with local colleges statting their basketball games for $80 a game. There’s about two games per week. Finally, to make these two occasional yet awesome sports experiences work, I work part-time a grocery store for about 25 hours a week. 

This is all amazing and I’m so excited to have experience with a professional sports team. I believe it will really help me get a full-time job somewhere in professional sports soon. However, I am interviewing for a full-time athletic communications job right now as well. It pays 50k a year and is stable, and safe. It’s what I used to do before I moved in with my girlfriend. 

I’m worried that if I pass up the full-time opportunity, I may regret it down the line if I struggle to find work. However, if I take the full-time job, I’lll have to stop working with the professional sports team which will make me sad, and will hurt my chances of working on professional sports down the line.

I had a 3 last year. The reasoning. Basically because my position is more senior in title than other members on the team, they expect more “leadership” out of me. My position involves interacting with about 40 individuals from 3-5 different teams at a time, and bringing together their work, as a project manager. I have people bringing me, ideas and pet projects all day long, and I pick and choose the ones that I think will get the job done in the most efficient and clean way possible (using tools, contextual clues, and historical data.

Gotten access to Database/tools/syncing/building builds to our testserver/feature owner/even tho i was junior i took ower the lead when he was in parental vacation etc. everything went well.

The company itself sadly was dying tho so after 5 years when the company lost 80% of its workers i also decided to quit because i didn't see any future here anymore.

Last 2 companies tho.... things went really bad. Even tho i wasn't a junior anymore but a ""Regular"" (kinda middlle between junior/senior i was not given access to any tools/databases/etc. i felt like an intern and that sadly repeated in my last company too. So over the last 4 years i unlearned more than i learned so im stuck with very bad knowledge and skills currently. 

Last company wanted to push me into a management direction which i didn't wanted to go to, had a small fight with my boss because he didn't accept that until they fired me. 

Now for the first time in 9 years i am unable to find a job because most people look for a senior with more skills or want a junior. 

So im into a career where i lack skills and also a future i think because mostly QA goes into 2 directions right now, either you manage or you test automate. I don't see myself (yet) as a management person neither do i wanna learn programming(i tried and even tho i am a very logical thinking person and thought it will be fun to me it just doesn't).  
  
Now im like where to go? I like IT overall but don't know where to go tbh without programming. My other interests are Sports and Music.

I do bouldering and workouts but boulder trainers are usually only part time/Mini jobs here

I play Piano so i thought maybe becoming a piano tuner but idk if that fits me either

I think i can't go for a completely new education because i would not be able to afford a living (very expensive in Hamburg)

Else i just got lots of random hobbys like club level player in chess, solving the rubics cube and things i can't make a living off. Also im weirdly between a very active person and a desk worker lol, i don't know if i prefer home office or do something active.

I’m currently in the process of trying to leave my job, and have a job offer on the table, but it’s lower pay. 

My current job is in a very toxic, at times openly hostile environment, with no support and too many constraints to do my job to any kind of good standard (I’m a service designer, it’s a relatively new specialism and needs certain conditions in an org to happen). When I think to next steps in 4-5 years time I get very stressed, because this role doesn’t offer me the right kind of experience to work in a digital environment, which the majority of service design jobs are. 

I started applying around for other senior design roles and was told by 2 leading service design employers that I wasn’t experienced enough yet. I know that I won’t get this experience working in my current role, due to aforementioned constraints. 

I then applied for a mid level design role and got it. It’s with a well respected service design employer in the UK, with a really high calibre team. I will learn a lot and become a much more employable designer there. It would set me on a much more lucrative path in the longer term. The only issue is that it’s lower pay than my current role. 

I might be looking at another 2 years before I get back to my current salary level. 

The alternative is staying where I am and continuing to earn the same higher salary, but be miserable and (most likely) not very employable in the wider industry if wanted to move on. So in a sense I would be getting stuck. 

Is it worth the move to a slightly lower paying role, for much better long term career prospects? ",2024-11-10 19:50:40

Currently, I work at CVS making $20 and have been here for 3.5 years. It was my first job. They’ve said they want to get me promoted for quite some time, but I feel as if they keep pushing it off or further from me. But my current manager seems to be telling me I will get promoted this year. First, she said November, but that didn’t happen. Another factor is my drive is about 30 minutes  with no traffic and ~25 miles. I also just really don’t feel happy here anymore, but I’ve had a lot going on, so it could be that. 

Now I was looking on Indeed and saw there was a position I was thinking about applying for. It’s as  a delivery driver for Amazon DSD. They pay more, $21.50, so a $1.50 more than what I make currently. And my drive would be about 15 minutes and <10 miles. They say it’s a 4-day work week, which is a plus, but I’m willing to work OT if they want me to. I’ve always thought doing something like this would be fun. I know it’s hectic and can be nonstop, which is fine. Financially, it might sound better, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it. 


Last part, I’m also trying to pay off some debt and just feel it’s hard with me not making enough currently, unless they were to promote me at CVS, which gives me like an 8% raise, which slightly puts me over what the delivery driver positions offer, +5 OT hours, which I’m not sure is worth it with my drive still because I see that is one of my main expenses, because I need to fill up about every 5 days, and it costs about $50 every time. 

I would just like to hear your advice on what I should do. Should I stay where I’m at and try to continue to grow or should I do something different? Thank you if you read this all. ",2024-11-10 18:45:37

In 2016, I went to college on a football scholarship. I decided to major in computer science because I’ve always been very tech-savvy and very interested in computers, as well as being very good at math.
After my first 2 semesters, my grades were absolutely terrible and I was ineligible to play. Long story short, the head coach who recruited me was fired mid-season and the new coach kicked many players off the team including myself. My grades were not bad because I was I wasn’t smart enough, but because I was so young and immature that I didn’t realize what I had going for me. After losing my scholarship I had to drop out. 

As a person who suffers from depression, It took me a long time to get over blowing the opportunity I worked so hard for. After I dropped out I started working full time at the best paying entry level jobs I
Could find. 
Flash forward 8 years..
I have learned a lot about myself and have finally devolved the grit and work ethic I should’ve had when I was in college.

Im currently 27 living in a small town in the Panhandle. After working hard to get my credit up, My fiancé and I bought a single wide trailer. Rent is so expensive here and I always feel like it’s money wasted , when your rent money could be going to something that you own. Our mortgage payment is lower than any rent we could find in the area. We also don’t know which way the housing market is gonna go so we decided to pull the trigger. The only other debt we have is about $15,000 left on a car payment.

My fiancée is currently enrolled in college and is very close to having her BSN for nursing. She works about 30 hours a week at a grocery store. I currently work as an entry level auto technician working 40 hours a week. There are so few jobs in the area. The average pay is around $14-17 an hour. I’m tired at chipping away at these low paying jobs and just want to start a career. 

The long term plan we had was for her to go to school and us both work to pay the bills until
She graduates and starts making a lot better money so I have the freedom to learn a trade , or go back to school. I just get so down because I want so much more in life and I am so lost. I don’t want to get a degree in computers and absolutely hate it , or not be able to find a job anywhere. I wake up early and work hard every day and take pride in my work , no matter what it is. I just feel like a lot of times it’s for nothing.

I’m interested in:
Computers
Math
Science
Cooking
Welding
Electric
Car audio
Owning my own business

Any words of advice or guidance is much appreciated. Thank you for your time!",2024-11-10 18:17:28

So I had an accident a few months ago. A surgery and then a second surgery for a post surgical infection that almost turned into osteomylitis (Bone infection). Was pumped with antibiotics for a number of weeks and just recently got off. Needless to say the infection and anticipation of being in hospital on IV antibiotics and unpredictability of infections changed my perception of things and have come to realise life is too short to be in a job you dislike to make corporate overlords happy.

Have been within my space for 6 years and pay has been absymmal at best. Working within the data and commercial sales space and every job I apply for has a shit tonne of applicants and the multiple interviews just for a job has gotten to me let alone the increasing requirements for analyst jobs, asking for multiple languages, tools, applications etc. Its probably because I dont have a tech background but I can't keep up with the constant learning. Every manager expects you to pull a rabbit out of a hat and just thinking about the work gives me a great sense of dread. I hate coding but that's probably where the money is in data? Most of my analytical roles involved excel, macros, power bi, salesforce etc but the pay still seems crap when you take into cost of living in sydney.
 
I didn't pursue graduate school within health and I regret it hard now. I am trying to figure out some options and potentially finish graduate school back in health but my GPA was shit. The initial goal was to get into physiotherapy.

Long story short, I currently work in law enforcement. I was diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor and while it may not be cancer, it made me realize how short life is. It made me realize how much I hate my job and to finally pursue my dream job: post production sound mixing for film. I did sound stuff all through high school and some of my early adulthood (I'm 26), however my parents were never the ""follow what makes you happy"" type. They were miserable with their jobs but it paid the bills so in turn that was the mind set ingrained into me and my siblings: take the stable job that allows you to survive. 

I've always wanted a simple and cozy life. I recently visited a friend in Arkansas near Fayetteville and I absolute fell in love with it. The cheaper cost of living (cheaper minimum wage however), the mountains, the fact that your daily driving consists of trees and not skyscrapers, and the biggest thing of all: perfect for a family. The fact that there's tons of free things to do, the fact I can let my child (he's 1.5 years now) ride his bike down the street or play with the neighborhood kids, it's everything I've always wanted in life. 

My question is this: my dream job would eventually require me to move to the heart of Los Angeles. Rent for a 2 bedroom is ridiculous, gas prices are higher, traffic is unbearable, etc etc. Moving to Arkansas, while it wouldn't involve ever winning an Oscar for sound design, still has opportunity to work on sound for smaller indie-films, live sound for events, and I feel would just make life feel safe and cozy if that makes sense.

Throughout this extensive process, I maintained regular communication with HR, who consistently reassured me of the firm’s profound interest in my candidacy. They emphasized that I was the sole candidate being considered and expressed their intention to craft a more senior role tailored to my qualifications, as I initially applied to a more junior role. In fact, accoridng to HR, they were told to stop receiving applications from others because they wanted to focus on me.

At one point the managing director asked me to ""delay the response to the other offers as much as possible until you hear back from us with more concrete details. We believe what we can offer you will play to your strengths and your capabilities. We are serious about this and the time we have invested in this process is a positive thing and how we feel about you"".

During one of my interactions, a senior partner expressed his desire for me to meet a lawyer they were looking to recruit, as I would be working closely with him in my business development role. The firm plans to launch an office in my city as of January next year and will be looking to increase the headcount there. This indication that he wanted me to connect with this prospective colleague felt like a strong signal that progress was being made in my application process. I received consistent feedback that I was a cultural fit for the firm, my vision aligned with theirs, and they appreciated my strengths, particularly my ability to cover business development efforts across several regions, which they found attractive.

Everything pointed toward the likelihood of my hiring, and even HR mentioned with every week that she believed the signs indicated I would receive an offer very soon. In light of this, I declined other job offers while waiting for a final offer from them, which has compounded my frustration and anger. However, to my astonishment, I was ultimately informed by HR that they would not be proceeding with my application. This revelation was particularly shocking, given the firm’s plans to inaugurate a new office in my city and their previous affirmations regarding my suitability as a valuable addition to their team. When the HR representative called me, I could sense her distress; she appeared almost teary and expressed her own confusion about the decision, noting that the only explanation she received was that they would not be moving forward with me. This sudden turn of events has truly blindsided me, leaving me to ponder the underlying reasons for this unexpected outcome.

HR sympathized with me and in private told me they are on my side and are also very surprised at the decision. She was very empathetic towards me. She offered to help me in any way possible. So she spoke to upper management and the managing director would like to connect with me on Monday morning presumably to tell me their reasons for not proceeding ahead with me. Ideally I want to refer him back to what he said about postponing the other offers until they get back to me and basically use that as an opportunity to make him rethink the decision as I feel they should compensate me in some form, not monetary of course but offer me a job due to the circumstances.",2024-11-10 17:50:58

careerguidance,1go36t3,Lab positions with AA degree?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1go36t3/lab_positions_with_aa_degree/,0,"My friend is 21 and has started and stopped college twice. She is now going to a community college. She does not really like school and has no career direction. So far, the only courses she has liked are the lab parts of science classes. She is social and personable and I think she may like the labs because she can talk and move around and all of that. Also, I think she likes the 'discovery' part of lab work. Anyway: she is almost done with her AA and is unsure about going to college for a BA or BS. Her parents say they will pay for the whole thing but they don't want to pressure her because they feel she was not ready before and it just was a big waste of money. So I am writing to see if there are lab jobs -- like a lab assistant or a lab tech -- for people with only an AA degree I can imagine her working for a year or two and then returning to finish a degree. Is this a viable plan? Do labs hire people with AA degrees? Or is a four-year degree required? Thank you.",2024-11-10 15:31:47

About me, I'm a creative person and a person who likes to work pratical instead of theoretical always. I've came across a lot of degrees and courses based on my interest and I came upon visual communication. (The part of exploration and creation of this course made me interested in this)

If there's anyone out there who knows about this degree or someone who's studying this, please let me know if there'll be a part of this course where I should draw living being images (humans and animals) {p.s. I should not create such images based on my religion and I value the point}

careerguidance,1go2oco,PhD or Work?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1go2oco/phd_or_work/,3,"Hello! A brief introduction about myself~ I'm a bachelor of computer science in my final year and will be interning some time in March 2025. I major in this Human-Centred Computing (focuses on Ai, Data Analytics, Simulation Modelling, and UI/UX). I currently live in Malaysia and the current AI scene here is booming like crazy.

As a final year student, I've already started to contemplate whether I should further my studies or just start working. So the question is PhD or Work?

Option No.1 - Work
I would most probably prefer to work in a more Ai or Data Analytics centric job. I'd love to handle data and process it (yes I'm a nerd). It's just something I'm decent at and find joy in doing. R&D kind of companies would be cool too. I however would like to stay away from web dev as I don't think I'll be that good in it or at least have tried it and have not found any joy in it whatsoever. The main driving factors in choosing this path is money, and work experience. Both are good and better if I want to stay in the industry.

Option No.2 - PhD
I want to further my studies to a PhD because it's something I've wanted to do. Not really for the title, but more for knowledge sake. I want to find connections and how I can link both fine arts and technology together into something cohesive. The downsides however is that I will have no working experience once I have a PhD as I want to do it full-time and get it done quick and I feel that my working options would become scoped down to being lecturer only.

So I have less than a year to figure this out and decide for good. I really need advice. What do you guys/gals think?",2024-11-10 15:08:30

And the thought that I need to open a company, and pay for this and pay for that just to make my own startup (about $5k just to get started). When I can use the money for self improvement (fixing some missing teeth for example).

I don't really have a TL;DR, but I did spoiler the things that add context, but aren't completely necessary.

Hi, I'm 22NB, and while this is my second hospitality job, I've been a service worker to the public since I was 16-17. I currently work as a front desk agent at a resort, making $15/hr fulltime, and have been at this particular job since May 2024.

I technically have manager experience on paper; however, that was at Papa Johns, and I sucked at it.>! I struggled with time management, and everything needed to be done in X amount of time, with no help, and an abusive manager.!< Thus, I wouldn't personally call this experience, as I learned nothing to take with me to another job.

That's where I'm at here. I recently accepted the position of OJT (On-The-Job Trainer). I already help out my fellow coworkers where I can, so why not get the title, right?  
It doesn't come with any kind of pay raise except for a quarterly $300 bonus, and the only thing I have to do to get that is to not have any disciplinary action beyond a verbal warning issued to me during that quarter. Compared to the many metrics we have to hit as front desk agents alone, smooth sailing. But more importantly to me, I figured it would give me the proper experience to take with me throughout my work career.

Also worthy of note is that I very much dislike this job. It takes a lot of energy out of me, it gets sensorily overwhelming with golf groups/family reunions/busy weekends >!(I'm autistic, and while I am permitted to use my Loop earbuds per discussion with my manager, I have no official accommodations. We do have a means of requesting them, but I haven't had the energy to go through the website)!<. It's also just the same things, over and over again. As I tell many people, it's either overwhelming or underwhelming, seldom in-between.

I'm also studying towards CompTIA+, because I believe that pursuing IT will give me the mental stimulation I need. I like to problem solve and tinker, not delegate everything out to other people, or be yelled at because XYZ. It's the same old, same old. And yes, I know I'll have to start out basically delegating everything, but at least there's opportunity for growth, even if it means switching companies to achieve it.

We just got a new hire, and though I was explicitly told that I wouldn't be the only one training her so that she wasn't ""thrown at me"", I find that I *am* the only one training her on our shared shifts. Our supervisor trains her on their shared shifts, but she's otherwise my work responsibility. They tell me what she needs to focus on, and I have to balance that with doing my regular job of checking people in. Even when it's busy and I have to manage not getting overwhelmed with helping her with doing my job.  
I haven't received any training myself, as classes don't open up until Jan 2025. Nor am I receiving any coaching unless I reach out and ask, which I don't feel like I should have to do every single time.

My ultimate question: Are these just growing pains, or should I try to cut my losses sooner? I can't up and quit this job, because bills are a thing, and $15 at fulltime just barely lets me scrape by. At the same time, however, I feel my threshold for overwhelm and frustration decreasing by the day, and it's affecting my personal relationships (not to mention having to be extra mindful of how I talk to the new person).

My goal is to switch to IT by the end of next year, but there's still a bunch of time and money that has to go into certification, and then there's actually finding a job.",2024-11-10 14:32:39

I've been pretty depressed and recently kinda xame our of it and now I'm sat with no career and working in a field I detest, before a job was money to survive,now I feel like I need more but I've fucked up by being depressed most of my life. Any advice on breaking into something that's even remotely close to my degree, or just not filled with being shouted at by the public?",2024-11-10 11:46:52
careerguidance,1gnyx6s,Which free training program should I choose ? ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gnyx6s/which_free_training_program_should_i_choose/,0,"I’m in MA and there is a program that allows you to get certified as either an EMT or EKG tech for free. 

From what I’ve seen, EMT pay is very low but there are a lot of open positions. EKG tech salaries seem to vary drastically but none of the local hospitals here have any job postings for it and I think it’s common for nurses or other hospital staff to get certified and do it as part of their job, rather than hiring a person for just that. 

EKG seems to be better over-all but I do not have any medical experience either, which probably would make getting hired that much harder. 

EKG program is only 60 hours while EMT is 172. 

Any advice ? TYIA (: ",2024-11-10 11:46:21
careerguidance,1gnytap,"Thinking of switching into either Engineering, Medicine or Dentistry. Unsure of what to pursue?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gnytap/thinking_of_switching_into_either_engineering/,1,"So I am an 18M living in Australia, and feeling a bit lost in terms of where to take my career.

I'm currently studying my first year of Pharmacy, but I'm not sure if I want to stick around for much longer. The coursework's a mix of biology and organic chemistry, and I find that to be quite enjoyable. I've also been working in the pharmacy, and while the work isn't exactly amazing, it is bearable. The problem arises, when I start looking at my career prospects. I don't think I'd have a problem with finding a job, it's more so with the job itself. Pharmacists aren't paid the best, it's pretty much capped off at 100k a year, and the dispensary is a pretty high-paced, stressful environment. The overall sentiment in the industry (at least from where I have worked) is to find another career. Unless you are smart enough and lucky enough to become an owner, it's a pretty dead-end career. The thought of being stuck in retail, doing what I'm doing now, for pretty much for the rest of my life, isn't too exciting. The careers I have in mind to switch into are : engineering, medicine and dentistry.

I know a lot of of you are from the US, so just for context, here in Australia, a lot of the courses that are solely graduate courses in the US (like medicine and dentistry) can also be taken as undergraduate courses. Anyways, I applied for medicine and dentistry this year, and while I haven't heard back for any medicine interviews, I did receive an interview for dentistry. I'm not exactly sure how it'll turn out, but I'm just looking into the future, in case things don't pan out this time around. I'll discuss a little bit about why I want to pursue each.

Engineering. So I've always really enjoyed maths. The logic, problem-solving and the immense satisfaction you get at the end of a difficult question is honestly incomparable to any other subject I've studied. I didn't take physics in high school, but our maths syllabus did brush over the derivation of some physics formulae, which I also found very enjoyable. The creative aspect of engineering; being able to convert calculations and CAD designs into tangible objects is pretty exciting to me. The job prospects are also quite good. I hear engineers can make pretty good money, and I also heard of the work-life balance being pretty good. The one problem with engineering is that you aren't guaranteed a job straight out of university. My dad's a software engineering manager and he tells me a lot the hires are from abroad because they can do the same work for cheaper. Actually landing a job after graduating is a bit of a concern to me.

As for why I want to pursue medicine? I won't go into too much detail, but the desire has been there ever since I was a little boy. I always really enjoyed learning about the human body, and the idea of being able to analyse symptoms and tests to come to a diagnosis and choosing treatment plans seems pretty cool. The emotional aspect of treating someone hits close to home for me, and I think that's the aspect that really pulls me to medicine. I experienced some life-changing events in early childhood. I spent many nights in the hopsital feeling scared, anxious, helpless, and the thought of being able to maybe alleviate some of those fears for someone else is very alluring. There's many careers where you can help someone, but I don't know if there's any where you can have more of a personal impact than in medicine. And of course I'd be lying if the strong income (that is virtually guaranteed) wasn't a factor as well.

And finally, dentistry. This one has been the most recent consideration for me, but the reasons are pretty similar to the two careers I mentioned above. Interesting, hands-on work that brings some positive change to the world. The pay and work-life balance is great, and there's also an opportunity to open a business if I feel like going down the entrepreneurial route later on in life.

I know people say to choose a career you love, but money's still an important factor to me. I wouldn't say I'm a materialistic person, my biggest spending is on petrol and education services. But I still want to make enough that I wouldn't feel pressured by finances, and I also want a really nice house (a little vain, I know) later on which I know get pretty expensive.

So where from here? Well, my options are to either stay in pharmacy or to transfer into engineering. Pharmacy's going to act as springboard for me into either dentistry or medicine. It gives me a decent shot at both, as it's not super difficult to maintain high grades and to be able to study for the GAMSAT (equivalent to the MCAT). I think part of why I also want to stay in pharmacy is that I have a scholarship that pretty much covers school fees for the next 4 years (I'd lose it if I were to switch to engineering). The problem is, if I don't get into medicine or dentistry, I'll be doing pharmacy for the rest of my life. I know I could always try again, but I don't really want to waste time trying to pursue a career that I can't get into.

If I switch to engineering, that pretty much closes the door on medicine and dentistry. Of course it's still possible, but Engineering -> Medicine (post-grad) is notoriously difficult, especially in Australia. I'm not exactly sure if I could balance engineering studies WITH the GAMSAT as well. I wouldn't be disappointed with being an engineer at all, but I fear that I'd have that lingering regret of not pursuing medicine for the rest of my life. If I were to choose to go into medicine later on, I'd had have to study another degree, and that'd be a waste of more time and more money.

I apologise for this post so long, I just wanted some unbiased, outside perspectives on this. I've talked to friends and family about this, but the only advice I get is along the lines of ""do whatever you think would make you happy.""

Any comments would be much appreciated!",2024-11-10 11:39:14
careerguidance,1gntpn1,How to negotiate a salary higher than the internal promotion cap? ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gntpn1/how_to_negotiate_a_salary_higher_than_the/,5,"Hi there! 

I am on my last leg of interviews for an internal job application. Though I don’t have an offer yet, I am highly manifesting it and already planning ahead lol. This is also out of curiosity, so if it doesn’t work out I still want to get your insights for future reference. 

For background, I’m graduating from our management trainee program for fresh graduates after 2 years of training and we need to apply for our permanent roles. The role that I applied for is 1 career level higher than my current classification (internal company structure) and this position is actually open for Europe but I’m working from Asia. I’ve told the hiring manager that I’m willing to work remotely than relocation. I was actually told in my interviews that I’m junior in experience compared to other applicants and also to the ideal candidate they had in mind. Despite that, I guess I’ve proven myself enough, otherwise I wouldn’t be making it to the final interviews with the big bosses. 

Anyway, back to the salary caps - I heard from my trainee colleagues who have gotten their permanent roles, that we actually have an internal cap of 15%. This is not explicitly stated in any of our HR policies but rather what the recruiter will mention if our asking salary or negotiation exceeds that. 

My question is, has anyone here ever exceeded such caps? How did you position yourself to be worth more than their offer and cap? 

Also, if I work remotely in Asia, I just know that I’ll save them so much of their budget which was initially set for a candidate in Europe. Is it a valid point to bring this up, that I’m taking on this role that would typically cost the company xx times or % more, for an ideal candidate that supposedly would have more experience than I do, but I was chosen for the job meaning that I can do what they can, so to not base the offer just purely on my experience etc which I’m sure they will probably do

careerguidance,1gnyabb,Should I redo high school or specialize in IT?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gnyabb/should_i_redo_high_school_or_specialize_in_it/,0,"Hey folks,

I'm in my early 30s graduated with a BSC IT majoring in business management as a backup and I'm not so massively fond over the IT space so much anymore. I'm considering doing the adult matric (I believe for the American folks it's a GED) Brainline program to redo my high school essentially to see what can be done and unlock more possible avenues for study (my current NSC (GED?) doesn't allow many paths due to my mathematical literacy as high school subject choice (quantitative literacy?).

My current interest is mathematics and statistics, I tried to apply to UNISA for a higher certificate but the few math/stats modules I've done for my BSC is not enough to be accepted and I was rejected to study further. 

When I was younger I wanted to get into animation but realized although a fun (and extremely time consuming) and paid well job doesn't exist in the animation industry let alone in South Africa... unless you're a director or an accountant and that's when I decided to fall onto my secondary interest... Computers.

Now, I'm a super lazy and uninspired programmer and don't find it super fun. It's fun and nice to make something quick and automate a process or two but that's where it stops for me. I only do programming if I needed to - like assignments or if something is annoying to do repetitively.

I had a job as helpdesk for 3/4 years although it was nice from time to time. I loathe direct communication with users though and try to avoid it.

I do love documenting things like training manuals, writing instructions and such. I'm not sure where this can fit in the IT space or other careers.

I do have extensive IT background and could do more certificates but I'm over it in some way. But, on the other end I feel like redoing my high school is also a waste of time and restarting at 0 in the middle of my life. One thing I do know, art is something I love doing but would never do it for money. I guess I could but don't like the idea that I will hate doing it in my spare time due to doing it in my job.

Any advice or suggestions on what I should do is highly appreciated! Happy weekend!",2024-11-10 11:03:22

I’ve been a TAM* (Technical Account Manager) for the past 5 years and made the most I’ve ever made last year at $108k, working 50 hour weeks and occasionally on the weekends and holidays @ $42.50/hr. For 4 dependents to have a great PPO, dental, and vision I only pay $184 out of pocket per year, with a low deductible and low max out of pocket. 

I like my job for the most part but am basically a corporate piñata that can’t guarantee outcomes or effort put forth, all I have control over is how I navigate the path to resolution. It’s a stressful job with a lot of pressure and I’m starting to feel burned out. 

A recruiter reached out with an offer to do cloud enterprise implementation for $160k but I have to pay $14,000 for my family to have health insurance and the deductible is $7,500 with a max out of pocket of $15,000

It’s appealing because I would be on salary instead of hourly and I’ll rarely have to work more than 40 hours a week. I’ll still have to be on call for SaaS stuff but the stakes won’t be nearly as high as they are now. 

I’ve been with my current employer for 11 years and they’ve never had any layoffs in 50+ years of business. The new role is with a company that’s 20 years old and I don’t think they’ve  had any layoffs either.

I’ve seen people around me, like a family friend in their 40s, struggle because they don’t have monetizable skills and rely on loans and generational wealth to get by. I really want to avoid ending up in a similar position, especially since I see med school as a big commitment both financially and career-wise.

I’m willing to work hard and contribute my part, but I’m not sure what realistic options are out there for someone like me to support myself through med school. If I can secure accommodation and basic necessities, I think I could manage, but I’m wondering:

	2.	Has anyone here been in a similar situation as an international student? How did you manage financially?
