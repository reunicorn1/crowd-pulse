depression,doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2363,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,177,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2019-10-29 14:52:02
depression,1frqlk0,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1frqlk0/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,69,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",2024-09-28 23:05:43

I was so grateful, why is everyday so fucking miserable again? I don’t understand what happened. And it’s not even my head making me depressed it’s this wave of heaviness through my entire body.

depression,1gq8v1n,i honestly feel like i can't do this anymore,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq8v1n/i_honestly_feel_like_i_cant_do_this_anymore/,0,"I (17F) have been suffering with anxiety (or something) since April 2022. Because of this, I can't eat- especially when I have to do something like going out, going to school (then, going to uni now), literally anything. I haven't eaten in a restaurant since March 2022. I've only been able to go out to certain occasions and places because I was forced to. I've been at home the past six months, waiting for uni to start, and I've been crying almost every two weeks for a few days on end. I just... can't. Why can't I be normal? Everyone can do it, so why can't I? Today was my first day of uni, and I couldn't eat breakfast, heck, I didn't even want to go, I shed a few tears before my dad drove me to the campus and I willed myself to go into the building. And I came home during lunch. Now I don't even want to go tomorrow or ever. It's... too much for me. I'm not saying I don't have a good family, I love my family, despite not getting along in terms of my avoidance to certain things due to my anxiety. I'm trying to do this for them, but after today, I just... don't know.

These are the symptoms I'm facing- severe nausea when I'm told I have to do something (like going to school), my heart speeds up, my forehead is kind of sweaty, there's racing thoughts that make my head hurt. I experience all of these even hours before I have to do anything. Like, even the slightest bit of consciousness at 5AM, my brain goes to what I have to do and I start feeling sick.

I can't visit a doctor, I get sick at just the thought of going there. I don't know how to explain all of this to my parents, they think I get exam stress which makes me nauseous, but it's not just that. 

All of my uni classes aren't in the same building, they're in different buildings (workshops, labs and theory classes), and my stomach flipped upside down when I had to go to the workshop building today. 

I'm not even 18 yet... I cry every day, thinking it is going to be my last. I'm stuck somewhere and I don't know what to do or who to talk to, I'm scared if I tell my parents, they'll either react wrongly or they'll help me at the cost of telling the entire family I'm mentally unstable (I live with my extended family). I respect all of them, but they're all so overbearing. I'm the first grandchild in the entire generation and my younger cousins are supposedly ""not as academically gifted as me"". They all say I have a good brain and I did so well up until now.

But I just can't. I'm tearing up as I'm writing this because I have nowhere to go. I want to switch my brain off for a while and let it be quiet. I want to stop feeling sick. But I'm exhausted. I don't want to leave my sister and make everyone sad... but every day is just pure torture for me. Fighting an illness is one thing and fighting your own brain is another.

I tried looking for over the counter medication, but there's nothing. Obviously, since they're antidepressants.

I can't even eat food at home sometimes. It's probably a disorder, but I eat and it comes back out in a few minutes (my parents don't know). 

There's so many things I like in life, but this is getting too much to bear. I can't... be normal. I can't... do this.",2024-11-13 09:09:10

I backed her up and she winded up transferring to a different department while nothing happened to my leads. I’ve been planning to follow her but the last few weeks because ever since I feel so isolated and depressed but she’s been acting much differently towards me the last few weeks and it feels like she wants very little to do with me. I’ve spoke to her but she insists nothing is different but it is and ironically feel like things got worse after I voiced my feelings. Our relationship is strictly platonic, we’re both in relationships of our own but I feel so heartbroken and alone when I’m at work now. I isolated myself and the person I stood up for is pulling away from me, its been harder making friends as I get older and even harder making friends with women (who I rather be friends with) at my age. I’ve spent several days just crying the first couple hours of my work shift. I also don’t want to leave this job, the money and hours are great along with the benefits we get.I also want to add that it’s so hard for me to trust people and open up too because I have been betrayed so many times in my life and it keeps happening and I just feel like a fool and a moron and while I have no plans or real desire for killing myself (I have attempted several times in the past though) I do feel like my life doesn’t matter and things would just be better without me.

I am a 20 year old male college student and I am so done with life. Every single day I wake up and there is not a single thing I want to do.

I did really well in school growing up and ended up getting into a very good school. However I am starting to realize I am not going to live up to any of the expectations I had for myself or that my family had for me. I am constantly wondering if I have undiagnosed Autism or ADHD or something because there is no way that what’s inside my head is normal. I have no aspirations for any career I would rather just be dead than work to live. The world is just starting to seem more hopeless and hopeless every day and I just don’t know what to do.

depression,1gq8wa8,"Rejected from internship, will probably end it soon.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq8wa8/rejected_from_internship_will_probably_end_it_soon/,1,"Thought the final round interview went perfectly. Received a lot of positive feedback and got a generic rejection the next day.

I'm not trying to come across as entitled, if I didn't deserve it, then I didn't deserve it. However, I cannot live with the shame of this failure. I have nothing else- my grades this semester will be terrible because I put all of my time into preparing for the interview, and the crippling pressure of securing a good internship before I graduate (I'm a junior) has taken a serious toll on my mental health, making it hard to focus on getting any other work done. I'm pretty introverted and barely have any friends, and no girlfriend. So I went all in on this. It was my ticket to a probable full time job at a fantastic company, which is almost impossible to get in the current tech market. A ticket out of this miserable, lonely, monotonous college life that I'm wasting away.

This was all I had left to prop up my self-worth. You might say that my sense of self-worth is skewed. Maybe it is a little. But when you look out into the cruel society that we've built, what do we see? Money matters. Prestige matters. Achievements matter. How people judge you, matters. It's the hard truth, *especially* in Asian/Indian culture. It's human nature to be superficial. I try not to tie my self-worth to my career and material success, and I try not to compare myself to others, but I just can't fucking do it. The future I envisioned for myself is crashing down.

I've failed badly in the past and persevered through it, but this is different. It hurts in a way I can't describe, and I know that I'll never feel happy again. I know I'll always be dwelling on this. All the good companies are done hiring as well.

I've barely been able to get out of bed these past few weeks from the stress, there's no way I'll have the strength to finish out this semester with the weight of this rejection. So its better if I just end it. My apartment balcony is only on the 6th floor and I'm not sure that'll be enough, but there are taller buildings on campus. If anyone else has another painless way of doing it, please let me know. Thanks for reading.",2024-11-13 09:12:02

he texted me jn to pay me back but i told him it's fine and he said thank you like, 5 times.

it was just 1 buck.

idk it just made me feel really nice, i felt like i had something to offer somehow after that which is fucking crazy given how i've been feeling lately. 

maybe it's just the fact that i was able to get myself to go down and get the items for my roommate, and that i could even help someone out a little bit.

it just kinda gave me hope.

depression,1gq43io,Struggling with Detachment and Exhaustion,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq43io/struggling_with_detachment_and_exhaustion/,2,"I feel constantly zoned out, as if I don't really exist—just going through the motions, consuming life rather than living it. I've become a spectator in my own life. Despite being physically healthy, I feel mentally disabled, stuck in a half-lived existence. My mind is exhausted, and I've grown deeply pessimistic. Even the smallest tasks feel overwhelming, and I give up before I barely begin. I've tried everything to regain my energy and motivation, including various nootropics, but they only leave me anxious or jittery. I desperately want to feel alive again; I'm tired of being just a passive observer. This is severely affecting my career—I feel like an 'add-on,' not someone whose presence truly matters. I wish these feelings would stop, even for a moment. I want my mind to function normally again, to regain control and finally take charge of my life.

tl;dr

* I frequently experience a sense of detachment, as if I'm watching life happen from the outside rather than actively participating in it. This feeling of being 'zoned out' is persistent.
* I've lost my sense of purpose and find myself passively consuming content rather than engaging in meaningful activities. Despite being physically healthy, I feel mentally disabled. My mind feels constantly exhausted. Simple tasks feel overwhelming, and I give up easily due to an overwhelming sense of pessimism.
* I've tried various nootropics seeking mental energy, but they've either caused anxiety or jitteriness without addressing the core issues.
* My career is suffering because I can't shake the feeling of being an outsider - someone who's just 'there' rather than a valuable contributor. I struggle to feel that my presence or contributions matter.
* I desperately miss feeling mentally present and in control of my thoughts and actions. Even a brief respite from these symptoms would be meaningful.",2024-11-13 03:49:57

Peaceful. Leave everything behind. The world has hurt me enough and I finally get it. I accept that I'm not some hero anr that nobody sees me as someone they want in their lives.

The thought of dying is genuinely comforting. The first time I ever thought about how one day I'm going to die, and that thought calmed me, immediately afterwards I was freaked out with myself. But now it's more like relief. It's this return to equilibrium, how I came from nothing and I will return to nothing, that eventually, somehow, somewhen, I will die, and everything will be ok.

I've been through enough pain trying to love people that want nothing to do with me and feeling pain like my heart and lungs refusing to work, refusing to continue, refusing to make me live any longer with the pain. I try to hide it, shove it off, ignore it, drink it, hike, drive. It always come backs. It always grabs my head and forces me to my bed and blankets and darkness and sadness. 

I don't know why they did this to me. I don't know why I had to get called a stalker creep. I don't know why I didn't make any friends. I don't know why I got cheated on.

Every relationship i ever been in, I got cheated on so i think it had something to do with that. I never caught them in the act of cheating, rather i snooped around and found out stuff they were hiding that was/were detrimental to the relationship.

I can NEVER look at myself in the mirror so as soon as I get ready for school I just walk out the house since I already know that I look bad but seeing that makes me feel much worse. No skincare, workouts and gym, diet and good sleep will change the fact that I'll always be the ugly, lonely girl with autism and several mental illnesses. I'm the only one with a large and fat nose in my family and I always wonder why. I also look like a man with a deep voice, how worse can it get? 

I used to have 4c hair but got bullied so bad about it to the point that I relaxed/ permed my hair at 13. I knew I would regret it but I did it anyways, and I'm being ridiculed even more and people are calling my hair 'fake' and 'ugly' like what they said to me when I had an afro. My hair is so hard to mantain and all my hairstyles are ugly and I already have enough on my plate but I added more myself. I'm not allowed to wear makeup until I'm 16/17 which is in 2-3 years and that's so long. I'll probably end up buying some makeup anyways since I can't handle walking around like this anymore. I avoid eye contact when someone's speaking to me(mostly teachers since my classmates don't like me and think I'm weird) and It's not like I want to, its just that I'll end up tearing up if someone sees how I look close up. I do tend to get in trouble about it since they don't understand but I'd rather that then them making eye contact with a monster. It's so long until I turn 18 and days go by slow for me, I cry everyday wishing to God that he'll make years go by as quick as a flash so I can use the money I've saved for rhinoplasty in Turkey.

Nothing will make me beautiful, everything I tried failed. I just haven't tried makeup yet, I think that's a chance for me to become pretty.

And I am feeling a little bit better than before but there are still a lot of things that I haven't been able to speak about yet. I tend to bury stuff pretty deep and I get extremely emotional when trying to discuss things about my life that I find upsetting. One thing I don't know how to bring up to my therapist is intrusive images that I get sometimes. I'm quite certain they're not normal and I feel like I'm going to seem insane.

When I am very depressed, when I think of things that make me very upset or anxious or embarrassed, I get an intrusive image that is violent. Not gory, though, which I feel like is maybe less crazy? And never directed at anyone but myself. I'll see a knife going into my chest or an axe coming down on my head. Nails or pins going into my forehead. It's always very quick and not at all bloody or gross, it's really more cartoonish than anything else. I don't know if it's some bizarre coping mechanism to get my mind off of whatever is making me upset but I wish it would stop. I don't know when it started but I seem to remember an SSRI made it worse so I'm hesitant to start medication again.

Anyway, I don't know how to bring this up with my therapist because I'm pretty ashamed of it.

I am not doing well as I lost a lot of my friends, my life isn't so great after I came home from summer break working as a camp councilor, and I struggle with doing hard activities from being addicted to watching YouTube and staying in my room all the time. I think life is terrible for me right now as I like being extroverted but I also been isolating myself since I been failing college. I just have this mental barrier to not do anything that is beneficial for me in the long run. I haven't ever considered suicide, and the one time I almost self harmed, I stopped myself because even though i was majorly depressed I relapsed on another addiction i have. I don't know what it is like to be like on the edge of life as some people in the world are. As I am not at that level. However, I know how hard it can be as I read a lot of people's stories here and I wish everyone here to one day be where they want to be.

 I don't want to life this life anymore of waking up and never leaving my house and never stepping out of my comfort zone. I think I am wasting my life away due to external factors that don't matter. I lost my support system through my friends, I am in a whole new chapter in life, and It sucks a bunch. 

What would make me happy to get out of my depression cycle is to stop failing college and force myself to hang out with people. my future self doesn't deserve this because there is a voice in me that is screaming at me to do better. I don't want to snuff out that voice anymore. I don't think staying the same will make me happy. I don't know how I am going to improve,  but I am going to start trying again.

I’m in a weird mental spot the past few days so maybe that doesn’t help. I just feel like an alien cosplaying as a human. Life feels so bleak, bland, boring. So monotonous. People you love die and get sick and you can’t get them back no matter what. You’re lonely, single, broke as heck, can’t afford therapy. You don’t open up to anyone. Because you know you’ll burden everyone, even when they say you’re not one you know you still will be. 

But also you’re comfortable wallowing in misery. It’s all just some vicious cycle. While you’re capable of exiting the vicious cycle… it just seems… impossible, you know? Because you’ve tried for years and years and just when you thought you escaped from it, you get sucked backed in. Sucked back into the void of hopelessness. The loneliness comes back, situational friends come and go as always when you graduate, people get sick and die, the financial issues. It’s just hard to not feel like a shell of a human. I’m just existing, and I want it to end. 

The only thing that numbed my feelings of inadequacy was weed. But I liked it too much, it was the only thing that made my brain make sense and feel happy. But I quit. Now I’m just sober, lonely, and miserable. ",2024-11-13 04:38:10

Also I know part of it is because I can’t love myself i don’t think I’m attractive and I can’t stand the way I act most of the time and it’s been that way for as long as I can remember, I’m just tired and I long for someone to hold me and just tell me everything is going to be alright and be there for me.

depression,1gq6kob,I’m apparently too functional to have depression ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq6kob/im_apparently_too_functional_to_have_depression/,2,"So the question is, how badly do I need to fuck my life up again for people to realise I’m genuinely miserable and exhausted and close to my last straw? 

I’m apparently too functional to be depressed. I went to therapy yesterday and mentioned how I’ve been struggling a lot recently. But according to my doctor, he said that my willingness to set up an appointment is clear indication that I am willing to fight it, ergo I cannot be depressed. 

It’s left me really confused. I have a wfh job and lately I’ve been feeling so tired and demotivated I’m half assing it. I lie in bed most of the time and suddenly the whole day is gone. My mood swings from desperate hopefulness to abject numbness. I make plans and force myself to do things that I know I’ll regret otherwise. I keenly remember what it felt like the last time I was depressed, how much regret I felt for all the time I had lost when I got better. So yes goddamnit I’m trying but I’m hanging on by a thread. I have been to the gym in a month. That’s one of the first signs that something is wrong because I normally go daily. Im back to gaming excessively, isolating myself from others, troubled sleep, stress eating, losing clarity of thought, feeling numb. But when I’m outside, I can still act like a functioning human until I get back and have to crash for 48 hours. 

I feel on the cusp of giving up, constantly. What will it take for someone to not treat what I’m going through like a joke? I don’t necessarily mean for the doctor to agree that I’m depressed. I hardly thing getting him to agree to the diagnosis would make one whit of a difference to the reality I’m going through. But at the very least, when I talk about being tired and stressed, he won’t minimise what I’m going through. 

Like when I mentioned my stress levels. I feel constantly numb and confused and stuck, I can’t make a single decision and move forward because I feel terrified by everything, he tells me oh stress is a normal part of life. Everyone gets stressed. Life is stressful. But I don’t remember stress being like this when I felt better?? What I’m going through now is legit unmanageable even though I’m trying. 

Again: Do I really need me to mess up majorly in work/friends/life again before I can qualify to being treated seriously?

depression,1gq9ija,Why it doesn’t feel worth fighting ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq9ija/why_it_doesnt_feel_worth_fighting/,0,"This an an excerpt from a journal A few weeks ago so context is not 100%... I don't think you need it though to connect with the emotions. 

Will things get better. They almost assuredly will. Will things get worse. They almost assuredly will. How much better or worse is the real question. Do I think people can recover from this. 99.999%. Do I have the capacity to recover from this. I believe so. So 99%. 

What do I think is most probable though. What’s most likely. What’s least likely. I think about this a lot because I don’t like wasting my time when I am going to do something. 

I know what it takes to get to where I was previously. I don’t have the energy nor do I care or want to summon the energy to do so. I know the odds of a business being successful. I feel like I have a grasp on the odds of me living the life that makes life worth living. I know the work it would require to make life worth living. That shit never comes free. You pay for what you get. I don’t have enough “money” to pay those costs. And honestly I don’t want to anymore. I used to. But that desire and hope seem to have vanished and I have no control to get it back.

I also know how much work it would take to live a lesser life. And the life that would be isn't appealing. That’s also not worth the hassle. A mediocre life at best. I should basically fight with all my being to stay alive to live a mediocre life thinking how you missed your mark. Nope. 

I’m not willing to work for what I want. That’s on me and I own that. I’m not willing to work for a shit life either. Why would I go through that hassle. For others? That’s just as selfish on them to want me to endure for them as it is for me to want to be done with my pain. That all seems fair enough too. 

If I were a betting man trying to measure my risk/return audit, and I am, I would not bet on me. Not even close. My health is getting worse. Not better. Life is getting worse. Where do I think I’ll be in 10 years? Based on the information from the past and what I see in the future given the variables and what I know? I’ll be living a pathetic life. Slave to the systems of life. Probably divorced. Lower class. Wishing I was dead. Drowning my sorrows with beer and tv in a mobile home near a rural Nevada town. 

So where does that leave me now. Nowhere. Nowhere is where you go to die. I hope I found the right place and can save 10 years. ",2024-11-13 09:59:10

By doing that, I was told I’m not “serious” about this relationship. Despite multiple attempts, I still wasn’t believed and then recently I was told I was manipulative which I was just trying to get support from my partner they doubled down telling me to “stop making them feel sorry for me”. I just wanted support

I know it was probably the best decision because I have been drained from this relationship for months quite literally. I stayed because I thought if you want a serious relationship this is what you have to deal with but literally not even a year in I felt so suffocated.

It's hard to put all this into words, but I think I need to share what I feel. I am going through a stage that seems like an endless chain of problems. On a physical level, I have constant pain in my knee that does not go away, and I have been waiting for months for a surgery that could help me, doing rehabilitation that has no progress. The pain is getting worse, which has affected my work life to the point that I requested medical leave. I'm in advertising, a field I've worked in for over a decade, but I'm completely burned out and have lost interest in it. I know I want a change, but between the pain and job instability, I don't know how to start.

As if that were not enough, I recently ended a relationship in which I invested a lot emotionally, and this left me even more broken. This person was someone I supported unconditionally, even when I was in a failing marriage. But when he saw me at a peak of stress and despair, he simply told me that he no longer saw a future with me. I didn't expect him to react like this, especially as someone I was so transparent with about my emotional state.

On the one hand, I want to move to a quieter place, start something new. I also have passions that I have never explored such as carpentry or working on something related to sports, but I feel limited by the language barrier and lack of clear opportunities. Everything has been accumulating: pain, lack of stability, loneliness, and a constant feeling of being trapped in an endless spiral. Sometimes, in the darkest moments, I feel like I just don't have the strength to carry on.

I just want to feel someone cares. I want to be coddled. Self-holding makes me more depressed. I want to be held and be soothed like I'm a child. I want someone to care for me like I'm a child. It's difficult to explain, but sometimes I feel like I want to be held and talked to sweetly like you would do to calm a crying child. I have no friends and I am not close to my family. I only have one person in my life who has already told me to find other ways. ",2024-11-12 08:49:26

I am 5 years into therapy. 
I go every week. 
I pay cash. 
I’ve read the books. 
I focus on the present. 

Recently when having a horrible day I called my dad to ask him how he was doing. 

Two to three years ago I would call him when I was crying and couldn’t take another step in my day. 

I still have those days. 

How I react to them is different. 

If you can’t anymore seek therapy.

depression,1gq5284,Don’t know what to do (Rant),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq5284/dont_know_what_to_do_rant/,2,"Hi, I don’t use reddit often so I’m not sure what kind of advice I can expect to get on a post like this. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for all my life, anxiety and fear being the only thing holding me back. I attend classes at a university and for a while lived in a dorm, I attempted to kill myself off of prescription drugs and adderall and was unsuccessful. After telling my parents about my attempt I went home and took classes online, and they got me help. I’m 19 so I can’t expect them to do everything for me but they acted as it wasn’t a big deal as it was. I have medication for depression and ADHD now but nothing really has made me feel better. A few months later now and it’s like they forgot or as if it even happened- I have a job now at a smoothie place which isn’t bad besides the insanely long hours, but I can’t escape it. How do people hold a job for so long?? I can barely go a few months without wanting to do nothing with it. I know I have ADHD mental issues which probably doesn’t help the fact I can’t, maybe it’s the cause I don’t know. I just want to be normal. If I can’t be normal I don’t want a job. How am I supposed to work for someone else when I can’t even take care of myself. I don’t want solutions I just want to be fixed. It’s like my brain is wired differently than everyone around me. I can’t uphold normal conversations, and I’m in my head all the time. I just want to be gone. I’m such a disappointment, I’m 19 and I can’t drive?? I don’t have a car and I depend on my parents for everything. Despite that all I’m so ungrateful to them, I don’t do enough. I need to do better  but I know I can’t, suicide is my only option but I can’t even do that right either. What do I do. I just want someone to tell me what to do. I have no plan for the future and I just feel like a really big fuck up…",2024-11-13 04:44:55
depression,1gq50jx,Did it kill your love of art? Also a stream of conscious. ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq50jx/did_it_kill_your_love_of_art_also_a_stream_of/,1,"I just watch YouTube and scroll Marketplace for vehicles. I used to read for hours and hours. Hard stuff. James Joyce, Faulkner, and finally, in the climax and immediate end of a relationship, I read To the Lighthouse by Woolf and then a book of Plath poems (can't remember which one, I think Ariel). I read Baudrilliard last I think. I think Simulation and Simulacra was the last book I finished over the summer.

These books take me to dark thoughts. Especially To the Lighthouse where Mr. Ramsey is in the boat and everyone is going to the lighthouse while the woman (I can't even remember her name anymore, she was the artist) flips out on the shore. I never read a book that so captured loneliness like that. I tried sharing this love of literature with my ex, but she never understood. We sat and I tried to show her this book, especially the beginning where the guy is in charge of Ms. Ramseys bag, and how I felt. I proofread her prospectus. I put myself into writing I'm in charge of. Not anymore.

I made it halfway through Light in August in the past several months. I used to study grammar and English language books for my gratification. I would read and read and fill every moment I could with learning. Now I just don't pick anything up. I don't write anymore. I got my BA in English. There was a point when the writen word was beautiful to me, but that's gone and it's just words on a page. It's dillute, and sometimes I'll read a line from something and the best it can do is sting and make me close the book. I'm flunking grad school now. I study communication and media. I used to find it invigorating to try and fight for the written word and humanity in such an honestly dour and shallow discipline. Now I just want to quit, go home each night, stagnate and just age. Play with my motorcycle, drink, and jerk off.

I find I lose my train of thought a lot, I forget spellings of words. All the writing I do now is very mechanical and sterile.

I think art is introspective. When we create, we look inside ourselves. Sometimes the feelings are overwhelming and unhappy, so we can't look anymore or we'll destroy ourselves. Some people are brave and they do destroy themselves, and they become art for that.

Maybe it’s hard for them to know what to say, but it makes me feel even more alone. I have no drive in life anymore, I’m failing all of my college classes because my depression and anxiety work hand in hand to make waking up everyday a cruel struggle. I moved to a city 2.5 hours from home so I have no family or friends where I am which just adds to the loneliness I feel. And just the thought of how everyone wants me to succeed out here and knowing that once they find out I’m not gonna pass this semester makes my anxiety race. And then I think of the disappointment that these people who believed in me are going to feel makes my depression bring me lower. And each week I tell myself “this is my week. I’m gonna change, I’m gonna be the man I’m suppose to be” and each week I never do. I’ve started drinking more, I can’t sleep at night no matter how hard I try. I constantly feel like taking the easy way out although I don’t think I will, I’m scared at how much more appealing the thought gets every day because it’s getting harder and harder to deal with these issues.

I wake up everyday thinking to myself “I really have to live this life, everyday for the next however many years I have left in this world” and the thought alone is so exhausting.

So let me start this off by saying I really don’t want any comments urging me to stay alive because I promise you that would not be beneficial to me or others.

I really don’t feel like getting into too much detail (edit: I got into so much detail) but overall I have had depression for many years and it has not gotten better. My brain wants serotonin so bad but nothing provides it. Spending time with my family, foods I used to like, substances, friends. I have severe ADHD,  I’m slightly on the spectrum and I wish I could explain to you how painful it is to be conscious in my head everyday. I’ve tried so many hobbies and nothing interests me or brings any joy. Things recently have gotten almost impossible. There’s simply nothing that motivates me to “keep on pushing” and I wish people would stop trying to get me to continue this painful, unhappy life. 

There are some external factors worsening my symptoms right now. At the end of last year, I found out I had been secretly recorded in my bedroom by my boss for months. I was awarded a good worker’s compensation claim after the situation and I spent every last penny on a car to live in. A 2019 Subaru Outback. Had my keys stolen the other day and it’s 3500 to replace them. Yeah I know how that sounds but that’s what the dealership said since there’s no spare. Anyway, I don’t have 3,500 dollars. No where to live. 
I swear to you I have been depressed for the past 9 years. I have wanted to end my life many times but I’ve never been able to follow through with it due to fear of pain. Something always stops me. I finally feel like I’m at peace with my decision to not pursue the next 60 years but I am struggling to find a good option to do it. It’s kind of funny, all of this I have a terrible fear of pain. Any recommendations would be a blessing. Please don’t try to talk me out of this, I have made my choice and Its finally given me a little peace",2024-11-12 23:45:07
depression,1gpz3y3,Said to my partner sorry im depressed and they said do somthing about it then ,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpz3y3/said_to_my_partner_sorry_im_depressed_and_they/,2,"Me and my partner where having a hard talk, when it came up. We long distance and planning on getting married next summer and filing for a greencard so i can move there. I just got back from seeing them and typical post trip blues (i already suffer with mental illness but it gets a lot worst after the come down of seeing each other and going back to distance) We got engaged this trip and today looking on reddit at visa waiting times, i thought i would only have tk wait a year but turns out its more like 2. Being distance is horrible and i want to close the distance as soon as possible. 
But in the talk it came up that i need to stop focusing on the heartache of being long distance and focus more on the good to which i said im sorry im depressed, they replied with well do something about it then. That really hurt they know i struggle and they also struggle with mental illness. Honestly my mental health has declined a lot this year, i had a surgery with unfavourable results in the summer then lost my nan (the closest family member i had) a month later and im stuck in an awful retail job where i get treated awfully by my manager and customers, plus my physical health has declined in the last couple years. I know if i had a better job the distance would be better as i would be less miserable but finding a new job as an autistic person is hard especially as i have no degree and not a lot of work history at the age of 28 (been working for just over a year). But im trying ive been applying to loads of jobs, i havnt heard back from any but im applying.
Their comment just really hurts other people already see my as lazy and unmotivated to change but hearing from the person thats closest to you especially stings, i feel they dont see its just a struggle to stay alive and the fact even though im not swimming im just floating but not sinking that isnt good enough. 
I feel they were trying to motivate me but now i just feel even more hopeless.",2024-11-12 23:43:56

When I was a young child all I wanted was to be seen, but no matter how hard I tried I was ignored. 

I’m all grown up, but now all I want is to be ignored, but no matter how hard I try; I’m seen.

I can’t ignore people. They won’t let me. 

They dig and dig and dig, what the fuck do they want, what the fuck are they looking for? 

Everyone always wants something from me. 
My attention, my approval, my energy.

But I don’t think I longer have anything to give. despite that I feel like have to pretend to care. 

Half smirk at their shitty joke that they think was absolutely hilarious.

Give them a sentence when they ask me about myself.

Humor them with a slight nod of approval when they royally fail to explain a mildly complex topic.

I have nothing to give, yet people never stop asking.

They ask because maybe they see something  inside me that I don’t. Some worth. 

But I don’t care what they see or what they don’t. I don’t see the worth in myself just as I don’t see the worth in others. 

I don’t see the worth within myself, therefore I can’t allow myself to see the worth in others; lest they can to take advantage me. 

Do you beat the animal that is still on the ground? People will say no, but reality paints a different picture. 

People want to beat the wounded animal because it gives them some sense of power.

If I don’t show the wounds; they can’t take advantage.

The mask works. The mask is reliable. It’s always been. But at some point down the line, the mask became one with who I am. It’s been cemented on for so long, I forgot how to take it off. Or what it even felt like before it was on.

I don’t care to share my world with others. Nor do I care to receive someone else’s world. People make me feel nothing. So I reflect that nothing back onto people. 

I tell myself I like it that way. In actuality; I feel completely alone. But the loneliness feels incredibly comfortable.

So why tell myself any different? 

I may be able to control how people see me from the outside, but I know I can’t control how people see me on the inside so I can’t allow it to show through.

Keep the inside where it belongs - where it feels most comfortable; inside.

I want to feel. I want to connect. but I can’t. Not on my own. someone would have to teach me. But that’s not reality.

No other person can change it; Teach me to feel for others. That’s far too much a burden for anyone to take on.

A therapist could try, but at the end of the day you know it’s not real. So it’s meaningless.

I have no other option but to not care; Ive just learned to accept it and carry on.

I have no choice but to self delude into thinking that it’s what I want, and accept that it will never change.

So I can’t become reliant on it. So I can’t become controlled by it.

cope? Yea no shit, but it’s the only way I can possibly accept the reality of a life without true human connection.

A life without intimacy. Or at least genuine intimacy. 

What does it feel like to hold someone’s hand; give a girl a kiss? 

I’ve experienced it, but I don’t remember it. No feeling behind it. Just remains a blurry picture in the back of my mind.

I’ll take the cope on this one. It’s good for numbing purposes.

Maybe someday I won’t have to cope, but I won’t get my hopes up. 

I just try to control what I can. 
The mask I can control.

It’s fruitless for me to try and control something that I cannot. 


Did I do good to make you feel inspired, and motivated? 



 < if I can motivate you, I can control you >

< If I can make you feel good, I get to have you in my back pocket, I can use you later as an asset when I need it >

Fuck people. I’ll keep wearing the mask.

If there is something of worth underneath, I’m not letting anyone take it. 

I’ll keep to myself. It’s easier that way. It’s safe to my ego - the contrary is not.

But what has worth that is not seen?

If it has worth, doesn’t matter if it’s seen; if shared. It has worth still. 

But then how do we quantify what and who has worth and what doesn’t?

I feel I have nothing to give. So I give nothing.

Maybe there is a human being deep down inside

But If there is, it’s probably close to death. Better to leave it there, it’s too weak and hideous to deserve to be seen. 

It’ll die off eventually. Better to let it suffer alone than to kill it myself. To kill it, id have to expose it for what it is; weak.

I wear the mask because if people see the pain then they might feel something. 

then I’ll be obligated to feel for them. 
But I don’t want to.

all I have left to give is pain; hatred; apathy. But I hide it because I know the feelings I have controlled within will turn to chaos if exposed to the outside world.

I can’t control it when it’s exposed. I never learned how to. 

I’ve instead learned how to hide it, and I’ve become good at it.

I won’t allow it to see the light. 

the pain and hatred stays within. internalized and transformed into self-hatred.

But it’s contained. I allow them to see what I want them to see.

They paint a picture of who I am based on the external; the mask.

the mask that began to take form as earliest as my recalled memories.

The seemingly eternal mask that grows thicker by the day.

every person is a different mask. 

The mask for the weak and insecure; make them feel strong.

The mask for the vain and superficial; make them feel attractive.

The mask for the unintelligent and ignorant; make them feel smart.

ironically these masks I’ve crafted for others, have slowly turned me into the ones I was originally creating them for. 

I’m a man of many faces, but without a face of my own.

Why am I not allowed to be myself?

I put in the work, but every step forward feels like 2 steps backwards. 

Maybe I’m too broken.

I can see the future, but the more a look to it, the further it becomes.

People get in my way; try and steal away the self respect I work tirelessly to build and maintain. 

I guess it makes them feel good about themselves. 

And so my mind has merely turned people into obstacles that I have to overcome; Anxiety.

But I can’t let them see that either; drugs.

I could take the obstacles head on, but society says the consequences outweigh the risks.

It was people who took my self respect and confidence when I was a child, thus it’s through people I’ve searched to repair it.

So I wear the mask. 

The mask that is refined.

The mask makes me feel powerful. 

The mask gives me confidence.

But the mask is killing me. I want the internal to die, but I want to mask to stay. Instead both are decaying. 

The mask slipping; 

the internal disintegrating.



Funny how a society that endlessly shoves the idea of acceptance and embracing uniqueness - down everyone’s throat, seemingly rewards the most to those who are weak, singleminded, and unmeaningfully ordinary; 

They are the easiest to control. 
So I emulate the status quo; Pretend to fit in.
But why have I not yet felt rewarded? 
Guess I’m not good enough at pretending.

The mask is suffocating me, yet I’m still alive.

Exhale and inhale the same dead air. I feel like I can’t breathe but my chest is still moving.

I want to understand love; I want to be accepted by others.
But I don’t know if that will ever be possible. 

The mask is dense, but behind the mask is hollow and weak. So I have no choice but to keep it on.


If others can’t accept me, maybe god can?

But sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever be capable of taking off the mask for god.

The future is the only thing that brings me hope. The future is the only reason I’m still breathing air, as stale as it may be.

Because maybe the future will be better than now. 

Maybe I’ll be lonely, but at least I can be rich, I can be famous, I can be attractive.

The present is never the present. It’s only the past or the future. 

I have no choice because the past is pain, and the present is pain and some pain hurts too much to confront.

So I chase the future because even if kills me slowly at least It won’t take me in one blow.

I’m afraid that the present will reveal a truth within myself that is too much to handle.

Continue looking forward, so as to not have to confront the reality that is staring straight into my soul.

The mask is suffocating me:

Maybe it will take death for the mask to finally come off. But as stale as the air may be; I’m still breathing.

Hope:

to have peace before that last breath.",2024-11-13 01:55:17

depression,1gq5fg9,I'm suffering...,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq5fg9/im_suffering/,1,"No one even has to read this, I'm just using this site as a journal.

I've been with my husband for almost 10 years, married for only four months though. But anyway.. He's known me since I was 19, I just turned 29. He's my soulmate and I moved in with him 5 months into our relationship. What I don't get though, is why I can't open up to him. I've been battling depression and PTSD from SO many things, and I just.. Can't casually talk to him about it all. I feel like he will just tell me to suck it up or get over it, because he's not the type of person who would be able to understand my life experiences and how they make me feel 😅

And I've done therapy so much. I only found ONE therapist I liked, but he was very old and unfortunately passed away and I haven't liked any therapists or psychiatrists since then. And the problem is... I feel like talking to my husband would feel just like a therapy session, where they usually just SAY they understand but they actually don't, and they're there to get paid not actually listen to you. My husband wouldn't get paid from listening to me but I feel like he wouldn't truly be listening or taking anything in, and it sucks. So I'm alone in all of my thoughts forever 😅 Therapists always have noted pulled up on their screen from previous conversations with them, likelyyy because they don't actually listen fully but just tell you what you want to hear and jot down little notes for next time so they can read and remember what's bothering you, and that's why I find it hard to find a therapist that I feel like actually cares... Because the super old one was NOT tech savvy so he remembered everything and I think that's why I felt like I mattered with that one..

depression,1gq0um8,I’m exhausted. ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gq0um8/im_exhausted/,1,"Three years ago, I dropped out of high school because of my grades. I didn't see the point in continuing, and I was going through a tough time with depression, which I still struggle with. Now, I'm returning to school because I need my diploma to pursue my goal of studying abroad. I've always wanted to move to Japan - it may sound cliché, but it's something I've seriously thought about, even considering going there for language studies there. 

The issue is, getting my diploma will take about two and a half years, meaning I'll finish in 2027, when I'll be 22. I can't help but feel like a failure, and I'm scared I might not pass my classes or fail an important exam. I'm also really afraid that I won't be able to achieve my dreams. I don't even know what to do anymore.

I’ve never felt like I’m good at anything. I’m not doing well in school, and I’ve failed as a person, even as a kid. I don’t have any close friends (though I do have some online friends, but we don’t talk much - I’m still grateful for them). Just thinking about waking up and going to school makes my stomach hurt. It’s not that I hate it, but I definitely don’t enjoy it. I dread tests and exams because I either freeze up or don’t understand anything. It makes me feel stupid, and maybe I am - I don’t even know anymore. I don’t know how to study, and even when I try, it doesn’t feel enjoyable at all.

I'm exhausted, and I just want to rest and never wake up again. I've failed. To anyone I've hurt, I'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. Especially to my mother; I'm sorry I haven't been the son you deserved.",2024-11-13 01:04:41

but idk like. i just. can’t seem to find solace or escape. i want to be creative like i used to. i want to enjoy creating. i don’t have the motivation to do my schoolwork and i lose hours every day in bed too exhausted to move. i can’t “get into” fictional stories or characters like i used to. i feel so empty but talking usually helps so here i am, i guess. my support network i guess has been too busy to talk to me or anything and ive been so burdensome over the past year and everyone has their own things. but it’s lonely. i dont like feeling lonely and im not used to it.

ever since something happened last year that really emotionally impacted me i haven’t been the same person. it’s as though my cold and apathetic shell was split apart but like, i didn’t have the supportive environment i thought i did to help me sort of transition to personhood and so now im just like. scattered. i did a lot of work over the summer but i had to put those feelings away once the semester started and idk if i really finished working through them but i don’t want to take them out now. who even cares if i get better? the person i wanted to break out of that shell into humanity for isn’t in my life anymore. i tried really hard for months to get better and for what? now i just carry more pain than i did before. now i want people when i didn’t before. i don’t want to die but i want to go back to how i was back then.

the other thing is that ever since that happened, i just have bitterness in my heart. i think that might be why i can’t get into fiction or create. it’s an act of love, and mine has been displaced and wasted. even when i was happily alone i had love in my heart. now i dont. i guess in addition to the pervasive bitterness toward love, im also angry at that person for, even if not intentionally, carefully melted the ice encasing me only to discard me. left to evaporate or soak into the pavement. not knowing what ive lost in the process. it’s not fair. i never got an apology and i never will, i hardly even got an acknowledgment.

either way, the work is really piling up. i should probably get back on my meds. i think they probably blunted my emotions but i don’t see a reason to care. i have therapy and see my doctor on thursday. it’s just been a bad 3 weeks. i hate that lately i seem to tremble when im dealing with emotions, right now im shaking really bad. 

whatever. it doesn’t even matter. i seem to say that a lot after pushing back my feelings..? unless i have someone telling me it does matter. and i don’t. so it doesn’t. if only i could at least get all my work done, but im genuinely so pathetic and lazy that i can’t even do that. i have no idea if i truly want to do my work or not but at the beginning of the semester i was doing quite well getting everything done and still having time for video games. i felt an urge to work. now i dont. and im so weak and undisciplined that i cant just push past it like i should.

whatever. doesn’t matter.",2024-11-13 04:50:16

You wonder if the world is lying to you or the universe is playing a joke to you.

I'm in college, having a hard time completing my education because of these symptoms. I've fought out of academic probation once, I'm not sure if I can do it again as easily. On top of that I've been unsure of my future. I can't imagine myself doing anything but completing this education, nowhere but the one thing I decided was the ultimate goal for myself. I rely on financial aid to attend school and I've done nothing but fuck up with a seemingly endless string of procrastination from one assignment to the next.

I don't know what I'll do if I lose this ""golden ticket"" I've sort of internalized as a magic cure-all to the issues I've dealt with in my early life. I don't want to go back to my abusive(?) family, nor do I want to admit that I just can't do it. But I'm tired, oftentimes I feel I'm too tired to continue. The first thing that comes to mind when I imagine what happens in the event that the worst possibility comes true is just plain suicide. It's easier to just say I'll do that than actually come up with a plan B.

I don't want to consider suicide an option. Never have, and if I stay rational, hopefully never will. It gets harder and harder to keep that thought going each day, though. I don't know what I'll do if I lose the strength to preserve it.

Beyond that, I feel alone near constantly. I shut myself away in my room because it's always easiest to just stay inside, to ignore my issues by putting my head in the sand like they never happened. And where does that get me? A week away from an important project and the night before a midterm with nothing to show for it. I feel completely and utterly screwed in every conceivable way, and I just wish it could all end. I have no energy anymore. Watching my grades go down, knowing they're barely more than just some letters in all reality. Even then they still have more pull than anything I can think of. Those letters are my world right now, because getting my hands on a degree is my only method of escaping this hell I'm subject to. I never asked to be brought here, I never asked to be stuck in a dying world, with people who couldn't care less if I were to just end it all.

I haven't cleaned my apartment in a month. The floor is covered in paper bags from Doordash or dirty clothes I haven't washed in weeks. My family is supposed to visit for a few days but I don't even know if I want to see them anymore. Everything feels like a question I just don't have an answer to and the more I stand around the more those questions come back to bite me.",2024-11-13 04:14:06

I was taking all AP classes with a 4.04 gpa but now that's all gone. oh well! I think about ways to kill myself but I'm too lazy to actually do anything. I live with my dad who doesn't care about anything I do and lets me do everything I please, and I have dropped and ghosted all of my friends (which is not many lol), giving them no explanation on why I just stopped going to school because saying this out loud seems so stupid.

I love dreaming. I love day dreaming, I love having nightmares, I love everything that happens in my head when I have a reason to be not doing anything, I love sleeping. It's fun and weird in the best way. The weirdness of my dreams are what makes it so normal and homey. The nostalgia that hits when I'm back in my childhood home or school, talking to people I haven't seen in a long time, but also the strange random insertions like why did this annoying girl suddenly turn in to a rat? It doesn't make sense when you write it down or say it out loud but it makes so much sense in my own head, I am the only one that can really understand. LOL the symbolisms and hidden meaning are there and they seem to make a lot of sense but you just might be overthinking, looking for any sign to explain what you're feeling.

I have been taking strawberry melatonin gummies and they seem to work for me. and since I am only 16, I can't wait to get sleeping pills.

I don't know how I keep going sometimes, or how I can still wake up and get through my day while hating my life. Some days, it feels like a movie with no ending, not even a sad one—just the same 5-minute clip that keeps playing. It never moves forward, just stuck in its perpetuity.

I moved countries two years ago. I thought it would be a fresh start, but it turned out to be more of a curse. It's been a series of bad luck—an injured shoulder, an incurable disease, no money, a trip to the ER... I could list all the horrible things that have happened, but somehow, I was still okay. I kept telling myself that these were just sacrifices I needed to make to get where I wanted to be. That if I could power through this, I could achieve anything.

Well, it didn't work. I finally snapped and broke down completely. I was alone. I never thought something like this could break me after everything I've been through, but it did. I had nobody. Whatever friends I had made abandoned me, and I never felt so alone and broken. For so long, I had given everything to the people I cared about. But when I needed them, they left me to rot. I couldn’t function for months. I’d have random breakdowns, anxiety, and the feeling of not being able to control my own body.

Eventually, I got help. I distanced myself from these people and got better. I met an amazing group of friends, and although we’re no longer in the same city, I’m so grateful for them for helping me find myself. But at the same time, I feel anger and sadness for the person and the time I lost. It would have been different if my life was moving somewhere or in some direction. But I’m stuck in an endless cycle of job applications for a year. Maybe I’m being too stubborn, too stupid, but I can’t find anything. If only I were okay, maybe I wouldn’t be here. I wouldn’t have been so weak and would have fought harder.

I’m really good at skipping the point and rambling on, so I’ll try not to do that. Earlier this year my family moved provinces, and I stayed at my boyfriend’s house for five months (summer) in the original province, and have moved here and been here for three. My sister has gained quite a friend group, and my littlest siblings have joined a good spattering of clubs. I am 19, freshly, and have never lived in one place long enough to make ‘good’ friends. I thought I had in our last home, but it was a constant switching of who was included in the activities and who wasn’t. 2023 was my best year, I felt so happy and got over my habit of cutting (mostly), but then something changed and my friends no longer wanted anything really to do with me. At work they acted strange, and had weekly activities with just each other, where I was told there would be “no room” for my boyfriend and I to join. That bit wouldn’t be an issue or anything except for the fact that I introduced them to this activity, and knew very well that there was indeed room. I am a year or so older than each of them, so that is also a factor I guess, but ugh I don’t know. I’m still in contact with them, but this week they have crossed multiple provinces to see each other, essentially passing right by me but not bothering to stop, even though I told each of them that I would be more than willing to drive and meet up for a little while. Now, of course, this whole rant probably seems like a whole self-pitying speech, but the bottom line is that I’m so lonely. I find it hard to be happy, although I’ve gotten very very good at faking it. I missed my family all summer, and now I miss my boyfriend and everyone out there. It feels like my heart is never going to be whole. I’m moving back out there myself at the end of the month, and that should make me excited, but instead I’m just filled with anxiety over the fact that I know I’m not going to be happy, I’m just going to miss more people.

On a previous account that I deleted I posted here about my relationship with my father, and how that made me consider offing myself. I was unanimously told that he is a narcissist, which I am considering is true. 

I still live with my father because he has drilled fear into me that I cannot live on my own. Despite having a BS in biology, he has on many occasions told me that I wouldn’t be able to get a better job than I have (I have a job that pays slightly above minimum wage in the US). He has specifically discouraged me from applying from better jobs that I was offered, often paying up to $28-$30 hourly. 

I feel that I have listened to this fear because I live in a city without public transportation, and I cannot drive due to a disease. 

Today, he couldn’t figure out some computer problem, and specifically asked for some help. However, he was constantly yelling at me, and wouldn’t listen to what I suggested. I walked away, then he yelled for me to come back. Then he went off on a 15 minute tangent screaming at me. 

I am getting sick of living with him, and this mistreatment, that I am willing to build up the courage and leave. I have many friends who maybe be able to help. I am just not sure where to start. I would appreciate some advice and potential plans. Thanks.

I guess i just want to start on how i feel and how it has gone to many points of despair and offing myself. i just want to tell my stupid story before i go.

growing up was not particularly unique or developmentally there. i grew up with my grandparents and my biological parents didn’t parent me. I fell in tune with my grandparents and their hobbies are what i do today. they are what give me joy; if they’re happy, then i’m happy. i can remember my grandpa’s signature ommlette and i miss it sometimes. 

i didn’t really bond well with my parents. they yell at me for trying stupid things and when i do the right things, any simple mistake on my part just infuriates them. and so when i try to please them with studying and trying to make them happy, it never turned into my favor and haven’t received their love back. it’s a very thorny relationship and i know that they’re learning too as parents. they’re people too. so their constant harassment and them trying to mold me into a “perfect child” never worked. My parents really wanted me to succeed; a golden child w a great heart can do it. They told me their dreams and what they wanted for me to become; doctor. lawyer. anything with high status to flex their child being the best. all that pressure and never being able to communicate my own needs just ended up burried within my heart. they constantly reminded me that I should be like this cousin or that cousin. they really paid enough attention to my present me. always my future me. it made me feel very frustrated and confused. I was always in this sense of urgency to make them happy. and even at the cost of my own pride and dignity, soul even. if i could make them happy by giving them my life i would.

I tried to explore life on my own terms many times. very few worked out. the one i really wanted was to be a girl especially during middle school. even though i knew it was impossible for someone like me to achieve. Both mom and dad were like, “wtf? why are u like this?” and even before this has gotten to this point, my mom kept reminding me that if she had a daughter it would make her life so much easier. ( ironic isint it? )
they didn’t even like that idea and beat the literal shit out of me. verbally and physically. then it clicked.
they never saw me as a “winner”. they saw me as an animal that listens to their reason like a dog. even when i gave it my all and thinking of them, it still woundnt make them happy. 
ever since then, at every step of the way, they always had a way to win over their son. 

it made itself clear to me. i’m a natural born loser. supposed to build a glorious temple for my family and all i built was a fuckin shack. a shit shack and they remind me every fuckin time and every opportunity they get, i distance myself further from them of how i feel about myself. even if i open up, they still put me down. so i can’t win.
i was never built to win. false dreams and desires. expectations turn into dust and no hope or dreams.

the only times that i feel at peace is when I can’t hear anything from anything in the family. home alone was the best feeling to me, especially when they went on vacation. just quietness.

i can’t stand with them nor at myself. i know i can’t make it. cause they don’t see me as anything else. so i let people walk all over me knowing that it kills me. all that’s left is no personality and all machine. built to serve the family, nothing else.


if anyone needs a liver, heart or organ, tell me. i’ll write my wills and make sure you get them. i see no future for myself, either male me or female me. i have destroyed my own self worth because it’s the only thing i know and can control. i’m this deep in. i don’t want anyone to save me. because i know that i’ll hurt them. it’s not worth it knowing i’ve hurt so many people with my own mistakes and i can’t bear it hurting others. i only wish to take my own. so if u need something important, tell me and i can see if i can give it to you. your happiness is my happiness.",2024-11-13 02:33:12

I am 25 now and my depression has not gotten any better. I used to cry when the feelings of despair and loneliness hits, but now not even I have sympathy for myself anymore. What happened? Why do I even feel this way? 

I had a beautiful girlfriend who was so supportive. She tried to make me feel loved but I was unreceptive. I was addicted to drugs and I lied and hid it from her. I broke up with her because I did not want to lie to her anymore. 

My family is technically still “whole”. However I hate my father and feel indifferent to my mother. I was born from an unexpected pregnancy, and my parents decided to keep me. It’s the one thing I wish I could go back and change. My father and mother got into a major altercation last year and I just lost it. I felt like a kid all over again. I decided to move.

Now, I must have saved some money before moving right? Because I worked. I had worked during my high school years to save up but it was all spent on rent and food as my tuition for university was covered just enough by the grant and loan given to me by OSAP (organization that provides loans and grants for post secondary education) 

Any remaining money I saved after graduating was used on a $5000 car + fees and maintenance. With $1000 to my name and $1800 owing on my credit card, I moved out when a knife was used in my parents last altercation. 

I had moved into a friend’s girlfriend friend’s basement. Rent was cheap but not cheap enough. My two part time jobs that I am working is not enough to sustain my food, rent, phone bill, car insurance, and drugs. After 7 months of living in the basement and almost maxing my line of credit, i moved out into my car. 

I have lived in my car for 5 months now and think about my life all the time. My family are technically still alive, but it’s impossible to make amends with them. They never grew up. The girl I used to love has moved on already. Of course she would. She was beautiful and she obviously could do so much better than me. My promotion at work seems to be nowhere near in sight. Looking for a full time in my field is almost impossible currently in Ontario (where i am). 

Why am I still alive? Whats keeps me getting up in the morning? To be honest, its probably because im just a coward to end it all even though there is no joy in my life.

I just hope someone out there can hear me. Thank you. ",2024-11-12 02:16:30

My depression started my Jr year of high school in 2013. I got a concussion a couple of unrelated traumatic events occurred as I was trying to heal from the brain injury. I’ve spent the past decade trying to become the person I was before my injury. 

This Winter I reached my lowest point, I was battling weekly migraines, stomach aches, etc. I noted my shoulders had always felt really stiff and still had unprocessed trauma I had been suppressing for years. I signed up for physical therapy, began opening up about subjects I was to afraid to bring up during my talk therapy sessions and got back into running. The migraines and other physical pain subsided, people started asking me if I had lost weight and I overall seemed happier. Deleting social media apps  off my phone and being more mindful of my phone use was the real game changer. I have no doubt that the addictive nature of smartphones and changes to social media algorithms are a (if not the) leading driver to our current mental health epidemic. 

I look at pictures of myself from even this time last year and I feel I’m looking at someone else. 

While it feels I’ve woken up from a long nap and no longer battle the same internal dread I used to, wow is the world depressing. I’m trying to to look at that time period before my depression with rose tinted glasses and acknowledge our society has made giant strides forward. Many conversations I have with people also seem to agree they miss life before the mid-2010’s. I don’t want to glorify the past, I can’t help but feel we are surrounded by more distractions and negativity in our lives that weren’t around before my started depression.

Should I take her words at face value when she says she still want to be friends?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpwyg2/i_have_anxiety_and_my_friend_has_depression/,2,"I dated someone a few months ago and hung out with her for hours on end weekly. However, due to her depression, we ended things. When we ended, she confirmed that she only liked me platonically, but not romantically. We agreed to be friends, but she said she needed space because of her mental health.

I offered to reconnect in the future. She said that she would like that, that she did still want to be friends with me, and that she appreciated my support. However, she's unfollowed me on social media, which is on one hand understandable if we're taking space, but on the other, makes me feel uncertain.

The issue is that I also have really bad anxiety, so I fear that she is just having a hard time saying that she doesn't want anything to do with me because of the guilt she feels from depression.

I'm second-guessing whether I should actually reach out to her again at our agreed-upon time, or leave it be. I'm afraid I might be a burden to her since I'm a ""new"" friend that she has a complicated past with. I'm afraid to get rejected again, even as a friend.

I really do care for her deeply and would love to be in her life to support her, even if it's in a quiet way. I really want to be there for her but I also don't want to burden her with potentially unwanted pushing for a friendship. Though we have a deep emotional connection, I'm also aware of the fact that I haven't known her for as long as her other friends.

**TLDR:** we dated, then decided to be friends, and she said she needed space to deal with her own issues. I want to know how to best support her in this situation. **Should I take her words at face value when she says she still want to be friends and appreciates my support? Should I still reach out to her at the date we planned to reconnect, or would that be burdensome?** Would love to hear from the perspective of someone who does have depression so I can understand her better, even if we aren't in contact right now. I just don't want to overwhelm her when the time comes, but I also would love to keep her in my life as a friend.",2024-11-12 22:07:34

Long story short, he kicked me out again and I’ve been no contact for the last 5 years, it’s been so freeing to be away from our unhealthy dynamic but I can’t help grieving the loving family I could’ve and should’ve had.

I’m so sick of feeling like I’m always going to be “not good enough” even though I have constantly proven the contrary to myself throughout my struggles. Why do I feel this way? I really don’t know.

I can’t shake this ongoing feeling of just being a shitty person. And I have reasons to feel this way. But then I justify myself by saying that everything I’ve said is true. 
A bit more context… I’ll talk crap about someone. A certain coworker has been on my nerves for quite some time now and I’ll talk about this person with other people negatively. I’m not making up lies. When I do it, I’m trying to vent, honestly.  But then I sometimes feel really guilty for doing it. 

Because why should I be talking about this person with other coworkers like that? The other workers typically share the same feelings, but it hurts the person I’m talking about. (They say they’ve heard us talking.) 

 What’s frustrating Is that like I said… it’s all true. This person lies. They don’t look out for the best interest of others. And they are in a position where they should.  It’s frustrating and my other coworkers see it, know it, and feel it.

In the beginning, I didn’t know what I was dealing with. I didn’t know why I felt the way I felt. I was so confused. Confused about why I didn’t see the point in living anymore. Confused about why I didn’t find enjoyment in the little things in life like others would. I was confused about why I wanted to die.

The thought of death seemed nice, comforting, you might say. It sounded like the only solution. Nothing else gave me that comfort. So, I sank deeper into the thought of dying. I prayed and prayed and prayed for God to take my life. For me to fall asleep and never wake up. I wished I would just vanish and never seem to have existed. I was tired of the constant feeling of not belonging.

For years I felt this way and only got more depressed. Then I started to distract myself from those thoughts, finding things that could make me happy. But those things only lasted for a moment. They would never last. So, when I went to bed at the end of the day, I still wanted to die.

For the last few years, my brain has shut off. I’ve become a shell of a human. The only thing I do is think; my brain does nothing else but think. And now when I think of what happens after death, I get scared. So, I don’t want to kill myself, but I still want to die. I now put myself in dangerous situations and hope I die. I cross the road without looking. I walk the streets at night and blast music in my ears, hoping I die. I go to bed and hope I stop breathing and die.

I’ve now found the reason why I want to die. I stopped enjoying the things I used to do because I tried to put meaning behind everything I did. And when I didn’t find meaning in everything in life, I started to question life. Why am I alive? Why do I choose to be alive? What is life? What is the purpose of life? And when I never found an answer, I wanted to die. Because what’s the point of living a life where you can’t find any meaning in it?

But now I understand. I can still want to die, but in the meantime, I should just keep on living. I should keep on finding this meaning to this thing we call life. As I cannot die not knowing the meaning of something I’ve questioned for half of my life.

I do hope I win this battle.",2024-11-13 00:30:19

I'm constantly sad, my science supervisor noticed it recently and said he likes to see me smile and would ask when last I visited church.
I'm not sure if it's my job, pressure but something is affecting me  but I am hardly eating. I'm also scared of going back to the doctor for antidepressants as when on it, I slept a lot even though it helped me.

It's 1 a.m. and I am in my bed crying my eyes out wondering why my life is the way it is. 

I am 20(f) and the only good thing I have going for me is that I get good grades in school. I have no friends. I have been unable to get a job for over a year and I have no idea what or when my next meal will be. I have an event that I am getting sponsored to attend, my flight and hotel ticket is being paid by the event organizer and I am so grateful. However, as a lie here on my bed planning my trip, I realize that while I am lucky enough to get this opportunity, the other person that didn't get this spot has money, has friends, has a job and a stable source of income, knows what they'll eat, and most of all they have a will to live. It makes me wonder if I am indeed lucky. 

My job search has been incredibly discouraging. I've applied to countless positions the ones I'm overqualified for, underqualified for, and even ones that fit my experience but nothing ever works out. It's hard not to feel useless when I can't even secure a job. This event feels like a lifeline, but all my worries about the future and how I will manage basic necessities like food during the event or how I'll get from the airport to my hotel and things like that don't even let me enjoy the anticipation of such a good opportunity. My brother has been great help, he got some of his girlfriends old clothes for me to wear so I won't have to buy anything new and I am so grateful for him, I can't even ask him for money because he has his own struggles too and I love him so much for always going above and beyond for me. 

  
I'm at a loss as to what triggered this episode, but I feel like a burden to my family, a disappointment to myself, and an outsider looking in on everyone else's success and happiness. I just feel lost, alone, and utterly defeated. Every effort feels aimless and unsuccessful , and I can't see a way out of this feeling of dejection. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but life feels unbearably hard, and I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.",2024-11-12 07:54:56

I, 27F, dealt with depression simce single digits. I have been realizing what kind of person I am. I'm a quitter. I started trying to lose weight. Lost 50 lbs gained it all back and now I'm sitting on my couch eating and on my phone. I tried joining a sport but I couldn't get out of my head so I quit. I had a job but getting out of bed is hard so I quit. I'm in college but I'm failing the semester pretty bad and the student loans are piling up. 

Now when i go to bed I daydream about a version of me that's out of reach and just cry. My husband compares me to his abusive father when we argue and my mother talks to him more than me. I just don't have the will or motivation anymore. I look in the mirror and see an disgusting obese. I was one of those ""just apply yourself"" kids. Everyone saw some grande future for me but I threw it away and became a piece of shit. Instead of changing I'm just telling on myself to a bunch of strangers. 

I'm just so tired of waking up. The only comfort I have is driving with the windows rolled down and envisioning the wind as flames burning away every mistake and flaw until I'm just bone. I want to end it, but I couldn't leave my son like that. I'm losing all will to wake up in the mornings though and I'm sure my son will start to notice how mommy isn't as happy as she was.

Our father is a present deadbeat, meaning he didn't bring enough money home, he didn't care for his partner or his children, and didn't care for the house and chores at all, on top of being a very ""back in my day"" type of man who first response to conflit or problems was to be the loudest or most violent, so my mother was overworked stressed and depressive for the last 22 years and me and my 2 younger brother grew up walking on eggshells even aroung the 1 parent that actually gave a shit for us, but always with the looming threat of being the feather on the cammel's back that made her flip out and berate us and emotionally discharge on us.

Me and my brothers can walk on our own, we can go out to the store, we've managed to make friends or finisih highshool(with a lot of time and retrial) we are ""able"" but in many ways none of us ""healthy"" or ""capable as any other"", our anxieties are through the roof, we are awful at social interaction and we 3 have issues dealing with confrontation/emotions, none of us has ever held a job for different reasons even though all 3 want to get one and try and get away, dealing with issues ranging from severe scapism to selfharm, debilitating panic attacks and disassociation.

And I'm tired of being silent about it, I'm tired of not being able to confront my own mother for my sake and that of my brothers about it being NOT OKAY for her to use us as emotional punching bags, making us seem like awful people for not sitting by her side as young as 7-10 so she could talk about her heartbreaks, broken dreams, depressive episodes, suicidal ideation and ideas of ""going away and not looking back"" and expect us now to ""man up"" and behave and do things we will never manage without support or clinical help. 

It just hurts that my brother was talked down to for being ""weak, coward, pussy, having no balls"" for not being able to confront his father the way my mother want him to do, to be treated like a traitor on a battle he had no reason to be in but at the time a battle that dictated where his life would go, with confiding in me that he is also tired of everything and saying that the moment he gets a job and makes enough money to rent anything that he will leave just like ""I"" ve said so many times and that he ""gets"" why I turned away from being close to our family.  

I don't expect my mother to turn back and realize the damage she has caused, we are all victims of an awful man but us 3 also fell victim to a hurt and broken woman, a woman that now expect us to be here and present and love her like if we didn't know how easily she can turn her words into poison and take us back to being a little kid to afraid of answering back, we love her but we are afraid of her and she will never understand or accept that.",2024-11-12 19:15:31
depression,1gpy4es,Needing advice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpy4es/needing_advice/,1,"I can't fully feel  any sort of emotion, and every feeling/thought has a numbing/buzzing/nothingness feeling. I can however feel anxious,anxiety, anger mainly because of a spider-web of feeling so useless/ and a failure. I can't even put fully  into words how I am feeling which makes it worse. I'm a male 32 years old 6' lbs180. Used to be a heavy drinker because of depression  and anxiety for about 10 years. I weighed 250lbs while being a drunk and have been sober for almost a year now. I guess I'm going to try and examine what I feel like daily physically and emotionally to the best of my ability. I daily physically feel very heavy, almost like my chest is tight and my oxygen levels are low. My breathing feels almost uncomfortable and not natural? I feel almost like I'm drunk with a sick spinning type of vertigo feeling. I almost feel like I'm vibrating/pulsating/buzzing which goes through mainly my head but can feel it through my body. I can't focus on conversation or make eye contact very long as my vision gets blurry. I try to avoid it because I feel like it's a huge waste of time and I feel nothing anyway. Everything seems so meaningless... i feel even worse because my kids need me to be emotionally invested but I really cannot feel a fucking thing. I look at them and I feel entirely disconnected and 
Disappointed with myself... I feel like I have to remind myself ""oh this is when you should normally be laughing"" or ""this is when I should feel warm and full of love"".. I don't desire relationships anymore, or to invest time into meaningful things. I feel fatigued on a level where normal routine is my entire day and I'm tired. My brain feels like it's eating itself lol It physically feels like it's shrinking and I can't formulate any meaningful conversation. This has been my life for the past decade now as far as I can remember.  I feel like a complete different person than what I used to be.. it's hard to understand/recognize myself. I don't have anything to really be depressed about anymore except being utterly diaguat3d with how I feel. It really misses me off when someone says people can choose to be happy and that it's all a mindset game. But i really feel like maybe my brain is tucked up from alcohol and I did abuse ambien for a short period of time. I feel like I have Anhedonia, Extreme depressive disorder etc.. 

I just needed to vent a little and hear from someone. Do you think wellbutrin will help with this? I'm entirely against taking medications but I'm at my end. I don't want to feel like this anymore, maybe it'll give me a few good years before it develops some other symptoms requiring more meds and eventually ill get colon, or gastrointestinal cancers from. All the nasty carrier ingredients used. Ughhh , I'm sick 😫  any advice on medication ?",2024-11-12 22:58:53

I ve been feeling this way for over a year now, since I turned 18. That day I still remember as one of the worst days of my life.

So, Im a guy with aspergers, ever since early childhood I havent been able to fit in and socialize properly. But at that time, I didnt really care. I have had some frinds in elementary, one of them is still my best frind till this day. But I do not have any particulary good memories from elementary.

Fast forward to 2021, I have started High school. Situation had only gotten worse then. First year I have had social anxiety arround people from my class, but still, I have mannaged to make a 1 single friend. And Im grateful for him, geniouenly.

But the thing is, throughout highschool, nothing really happened. I do not have any remarkable memories from there. Nor bad nor good.

But the part that haunts me the most, is that Im still a virgin. Yes, it is. However immature and fragile that might sound, its been my biggest insecurity for a past year. And not that I think that anyone would care abt it, I dont. It is the feeling that most people have already slept arround and dated and have been having fun since middle school, yet Im left behind.

And Im not even that bad looking. Like I really am like average, maybe a bit above.

  
And yes, I know people have much, much bigger problems than I, but that doesnt make me feel any better, I think Im entitled to my emotions (and sorry if this sentence sounds angry/asshole-ish, its not the intend)

Im going to find a therapist soon.

until you snap. yet the chain drives forward, it accepts it will never have more than the gold, despite that inherent indignity, and the only way to move on, is by moving forward. the chain will stay tough, it tells itself its better off without help, it will survive without it, and it will all be okay; but all metal erodes, and some chains break. breaks today are overlooked, it seems chains are only maintained and cleaned when the cracks in the links are close to giving way. the chain knows it will only get maintenance if it flaunts itself like the trophies, but it’s not like one of them, so the chain is saddled, between snapping, or looking like gold, and yet what happens to all to many, is that the chain shatters, with not at thundering clap or a desperate cry, but an unsettling silence and void, only to be filled by the tears, of the ones who knew it.",2024-11-12 18:11:07

 A friend would leave you because of a guy?

I was friends with sb for a long time. We got along. Like sisters. Her friends knew me. Her guy friends had this habit of teasing or flirting.
I was young at the time and had no experience in dating so I would laugh it off but I was very uncomfortable. 
I thought to myself, I'm focused on seeing my friend. And we talked and texted until one guy came along.

afterwards,she was very distant. Even when greeting. One time, I saw her looking at me badly because I was greeting the guy. I had stayed for a while not meeting them as Idk where I stand with her. She apparently was rejected by the guy way before I knew him. I was told this after actually knowing them, I was shocked.

I distanced myself from him after a while cause he was continuing to flirt with me infront of her, did that save the friendship? No

I'm wondering are girls usually like this, we were good friends like really good and then a guy is involved ans she ghosted me? I apologised for venting ,she said there was no need, that its okay.

 I feel so wasted my energy on sb who really wasn't my friend.
I am struggling to move on. I mean that's 7 yrs of friendhsip gone like that cause of a guy who didn't even respect her. Let alone any other girl. 

I've never been the same since then, I even got depressed and isolated myself because of the hurt. I never want to be her friend again but, I'm struggling to open up to new people

Only read if you are about to give up.

I have been suffering from Anxiety and Depression for 5 years and realized this.

To the people like me!

You will never be the same again as you used to be. You will never be normal like other people. 

Because, it is not your negative thoughts that cause your anxiety and pain. It is your brain that reacts differently. Do you think normal people don't have bad thoughts? Of course they have. Some of them even think more negatively than you. But they are OK with it. Everyone has a hard time sometimes in life. But normal people recover.

It is not life problems that cause depression. It is not your financial issues, neither relationship nor career or whatever. Even if you solve all of those, you will still feel empty. You will find another problem. Because they are only symptoms not the cause. Otherwise, you wouldn't see the news of a rich businessman committed suicide or a hollywood actor talking about his mental issues.

The real reason is inside you. Your brain has changed, damaged. You are exposed to the same life experiences like normal people are. The world treats us all the same. Nobody is punishing you extra. But you are the one who suffers.

Our brain has changed. There is no cure for it. Accept that you will never be normal again. A little better or worse but not normal.

So what's the meaning of life? If you believe in God, trust that he will reward you later. Because you know you are the one who are suffering the most in this world. If God doesn't truly understand you he can't be God. If he understands, he will reward. So remember this in your hardest times.

If you don't believe in God. Nothing matters. Not your success or failure. You will die and that's all. Like other 100 billion people did in history of humanity. Don't put a pressure on yourself. Don't chase. Just live a little.",2024-11-12 16:11:30

depression,1gpsipr,When is quitting smoking NOT worth it? Vape free for a week and I do not want to be alive ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpsipr/when_is_quitting_smoking_not_worth_it_vape_free/,1,"Please do not judge me, I’m an addict and currently only smoke weed and am taking a break from nicotine. I had a nose surgery last week and am one week post op today. I was told to not smoke for two weeks and I originally was going to stop vaping beforehand. Life has been wildly stressful and that didn’t happen. I only stopped the night before surgery because I freaked myself out reading the complications. 

I’ve been using a nicotine patch, which I know still isn’t great for healing, and it still isn’t enough. My cravings are out of control and I’ve been a raging bitch and am struggling with major suicidal ideation. I am almost to the point of just getting a vape tonight and trying again later down the road. I’m about to turn 24 and I know I should stop. I know I should. But I don’t want to at ALL right now. Like at all. I don’t think I can do this and I think it’s very bad for my mental health. Vaping was such a huge coping mechanism for me and I’ve ripped it away from myself. 

I know I should find a skill to replace it, but there’s only so much I can do. I’m healing from surgery, in an exhausting and toxic relationship, my little sister was just diagnosed with schizophrenia and I’m so worried for her, and I have so much mental and physical health shit to deal with myself. I don’t think I can do it. Genuinely. I don’t love the advice on stop smoking sometimes because they don’t think it matters if you have the motivation to quit, that you just have to stick with it. I don’t want to have lung cancer don’t get me wrong, but I’d rather be alive fucking now. And I feel so close to crisis and all I want is my vape. Yeah. That’s all. I’m going crazy because I had pain pills after surgery and I want to abuse them so badly. Like not having my vape is making that urge EXPONENTIALLY stronger and I just want to say fuck it all. I’ve been stuck in bed all day so wildly depressed even though I have so much to do. ",2024-11-12 19:04:20

Thus, never making friends, belonging to somewhere, or just having somebody to listen to me. I have reached the end of the road. Everyone will always mock me for at least trying to do the best that I can with my limitations. Why is there so much hate for something that I wasn't the cause of?

I’m going through a break up. It has been 3 months since it passed yet it feels like everything happened yesterday. I was 5 years clean. I had urges, but I didn’t because he thought of it as a bad habit and cringe. Now I’m a month clean and thinking of doing it again.


The first few weeks were rough. I felt a void inside of me. (It hasn’t gone away) I wasn’t able to function very well. I skipped classes and I actually failed some of them. Like I said, I was 5 years clean. But when we broke up, I couldn’t think of anything else to ease the pain, to numb the pain, because it was really getting in my head. After doing it, I felt the emptiness, numbness, and nothing at all. It was the peace I’m seeking. But after looking at my scars, it didn’t look pretty on me. I’m not asking for my friends advices or help anymore. They don’t understand me. They’ve grown tired of me acting this way.

Right now, it all came back, and I don’t know how to deal with it, I don’t know how should I handle it, it’s overwhelming and affecting my academics. I skipped 3 classes now and I’m flooded with schoolwork but I can’t find the motivation to do them.

And before answering my question, please do not give advices like, “someday it’ll get better” and such. I’m not asking for help on how to move forward. This is the only community I feel belonged and understood, so please, please do not betray me. 🙏🏻

I just want to ask some advices on what are the alternatives instead of doing self-h/rm? I want to hurt myself but by not slashing anymore.

Not 100% sure if this is the correct place to post this but here goes.
Why is it the things I want to do make me sad/deflated and the things I don’t want to do give me a sense of pride and happiness. I’m 20 and at university and this is my third year, I never had any mental health issues on the past (and I don’t think I do now but who knows) but slowly over time as I’ve been in uni I’m just feeling more and more dissatisfied/unfulfilled, it’s hard to put in to words. I don’t really feel sad or anything in my day to day, but I don’t enjoy spending the day playing video games or YouTube anymore like I used to in my teens and just feel kinda bored most of the time. I’ve got a good group of friends and we go out once a week so lack of socialising isn’t a real issue I would say. I guess I’m wondering why shit like completing a busy shift at work or cleaning the flat and doing chores that I actively don’t want to do makes puts me in a good mood. I hope this isn’t a stupid question. It’s just weird how I don’t want to do these things even though I know it will put me in a better mood after, same goes for going to the gym or going on a walk (I’m currently trying to lose weight). Is there a term for this or even a way to help myself want to do these kind of things? ",2024-11-12 14:26:37

depression,1gplreb,Help me please ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gplreb/help_me_please/,1,"
I’m 23 years old, talented, and building my career in my own way (in art). I come from a middle-class family, but that’s not the issue. The problem is that I don’t like my personality, and I feel a strong need to change it. For the past six years, I haven’t been in a relationship, and I keep feeling like something is wrong with me. People tell me I should improve my personality. While my friends say others are attracted to me because of my looks, they also point out that my personality is lacking.

I’ve been in three relationships so far, and none of the people I proposed to have ever turned me down. However, I feel like those relationships didn’t last because of deeper issues within me.

Recently, one of my friends told me that her friend had a crush on me. I was really happy to hear that, so I sent her a friend request, which she accepted. We started chatting, but after a while, she lost interest and stopped responding. Curious about what went wrong, I asked my friend to find out what she thought of me. Her response was, “He has the looks, but his personality isn’t enough.”

Another situation that bothers me is my social awkwardness. For example, if I’m in a room with five people, I can talk, laugh, and have fun. But when most of the group leaves, and I’m left with just one or two people, I suddenly become clueless about what to say or how to continue the conversation. I also have trouble talking to girls I meet unexpectedly; I freeze up and don’t know how to engage in a meaningful conversation. I don’t smoke or drink, and while I don’t think my personality is toxic, I feel like it’s just not strong enough to make a lasting impression.

A lot of my struggles come from issues in my past, especially family problems that have caused me emotional pain and left me feeling depressed. Even when I’m supposed to be enjoying happy moments, thoughts of my past come rushing in, stealing my joy. Because of this, I often have a sad expression on my face. Ever since I turned 18, it feels like I’ve forgotten what true happiness is.

Right now, more than anything, I really want a meaningful relationship in my life. I know people say that it’s not about looks, but about what you do and who you are. Deep down, I feel like looks don’t matter as much as people think. I just wish I could develop the kind of personality that makes people want to stay, not just be attracted to the surface.

Yes, I’ve had a lot of therapy. I understand that I feel unlovable because my dad was absent during my childhood. And I know that i feel unlovable because, actually, I don’t love myself. 

And yet, I keep projecting that everyone I come into contact with hates me. I want to ask for validation and reassurance but then I get scared that this will make everyone hate me more because I’m needy.

Ayer por la noche iba a volver a hacerlo, y le insistí a mi amigo K que viniese por favor mi casa que necesitaba su compañía. Él al final se negó, porque eso le cambiaría el horario y más cosas.


Al final decidí ir a urgencias para avisar de que me iba a suicidar, y me han atendido y tal, y esta mañana les he explicado que si volvía a casa me iba a matar, encontraría una forma de hacerlo. Les he insistido en que necesito algún tipo de compañía (a lo internar), pero ellos me han dicho que no pueden hacer nada por mi. Eso me ha devastado.


Luego a mis amigos les he dicho si podrían por la tarde y por la noche a mi casa a quedarse haciendome compañía, porque mi vida genuinamente corre peligro. Pero todos se han negado.

Uno porque ""esque no me gusta dormir en casas ajenas"", otro porque ""esque me afectaría a mi horario y no quiero que eso me descoloque las clases"".


Y me siento tan, pero tan enfuriada, cabreada, con rabia. Soy egoísta,lo sé, pero tengo que serlo, me he intentado matar ya dos veces en 4 días, y ellos no le dan importancia. Hacen como si nada.

In the beginning of all of this I would always talk more to the girl I found beautiful and make arrangements to hang with her and she would always bring a friend.

depression,1gpmnni,Leaving the Country I’ve Called Home for 3 Years—Facing the Struggles of Returning,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpmnni/leaving_the_country_ive_called_home_for_3/,0,"Hello, everyone. I really needed to write about this overwhelming period in my life and post it somewhere, as none of the people I've spoken to in person truly understand what I'm going through.

I graduated from a master’s program in Eastern Europe in July. I’ve been here for three years, learned the language, made connections, formed friendships, and even received referrals. Yet, I still haven’t been able to find the job I was looking for. Now, I have only a few days left to get a flight ticket and go back home, as this seems to be my only option due to visa issues.

When I left my country, I was happy to leave behind some painful memories. Little by little, I got used to the everyday conveniences here—things I didn’t have back home due to my country being boycotted by the world because of its shitty leaders. I became mentally stable, no longer having to be reminded of those old, painful experiences. It was a fresh start. My mistake, however, was not preparing for the worst-case scenario: having to leave and return.

Now, with so little time remaining, I feel completely overwhelmed. It’s not just the stress of packing and returning; it’s the thought of facing everything I had escaped. Most importantly, it’s knowing I’m now farther from my dreams. When I came here, my plan was to get a job, gain experience, and then move on to my Western dream destination. Now, I have no official experience, and applying for jobs from my home country, where the majority of applications are almost automatically rejected, feels a thousand times harder.

I’ve always had this silly idea that I should have my life stable and figured out by 30. Every day, I’m getting closer to that age, yet I feel nowhere near where I want to be. I sleep to escape reality, and I daydream to pass the time. I’m hesitant, I can’t stop procrastinating, and I have no idea how to handle this overwhelming sense of failure, depression, and anxiety.

I don’t know how to describe it, but the uncertain future I see ahead feels like a kind of death. I have a deep sense of loss—loss of time, money, energy, and independence. Sure, the experience has been valuable in some ways, but going back feels like I’m not even starting from the ground floor; it’s as if I’ll be trapped in a dark basement with no light.

P.S.: I used to have a therapist, but she eventually told me she couldn’t help me anymore.

Another P.S.: A few days ago, I posted on Reddit about being torn between taking a low-salary job and going back home. The first option is now off the table since I got ghosted after the interviews, despite the positive feedback I was told the manager received.

If anyone has advice on how to cope with these feelings, I’d really appreciate your support or perspective.",2024-11-12 15:01:11
depression,1gpi1au,I'm at the end of my rope,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpi1au/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope/,2,"A year ago my brother and Mom both went into diabetic comas, of which my brother did not survive. I immediately moved in with my mother to take over my brother's duty of taking care of her. She has been so difficult to care for. She takes no responsibility for her health and doesn't care that I had to put my life on hold for her. I hate that I had to move back into this house I desperately tried to escape. They let the house go just like their health and I'm left to deal with the aftermath of years of disregard to the house. Without warning my lower back started to become increasingly more painful. It got so bad I could not stand up straight, walk, sit or lay down without being in extreme pain. I was in between jobs and couldn't keep a steady job because of my mother's needs, so I did what I could to get treatment. My insurance at the time wouldn't pay for an MRI and insisted I go to physical therapy which was close to $300 per session. I opted to get a steroid shot instead and can walk and stand but my back is constantly aching and they're worse when it's time for bed. I did get an X-ray at the hospital and was told that my lumbar had completely straightened due to what they could assume was being extremely stressed. I've lost the ability to sleep throughout the night, my depression and anxiety have been at an all time high. I now function off maybe 3-4 hours. This past year has been the most difficult and I'm ready to just let go.

depression,1gpl5rt,I never tought i will write this on reddit..,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpl5rt/i_never_tought_i_will_write_this_on_reddit/,0,"I'm not sure if I'm in the right place, lol, but I’ll give it a shot.  
I just want someone to read this and tell me that I’m not completely screwed.

I’m 22 years old, without a job, and at this point, I have very little money left. I live in a small country in europe where minimum wage is 300 EUR  
I’ve been working as an affiliate for the last 7 years (yes, I started working in high school). I was earning a solid amount of money every month, during school let’s say 1,000–1,500 EUR.  
After school, I continued working and earned a similar amount.  
Then, in late 2022, I found a method where I was making 20-30k EUR a month for 6 months in 2023 and 15-20k EUR a month in 2024 for another 6 months.  
(Unfortunately, the income can die for a few months until I find a solution.) I was working with a colleague during that time, but half a year ago, he left, and now I’m working alone.  
Because he’s... well, let’s just say he’s “brain-rotted,” lol.

You’re probably wondering, *where did all my money go?*  
Well, I traveled everywhere, to all the great places you can imagine. I was at conferences, hanging out with friends, partying—everything.  
I bought a $25k car at age 19, have the latest tech, pretty much everything you could think of.  
But throughout that period, I also gambled. I gambled *hard*—losing 5-10k EUR per month (online gambling), and I couldn’t stop.  
Every time I was making money, I was also gambling. The moment my income stopped, I stopped gambling too.  
Now, I’ve stopped gambling because there’s no income.  
I don’t have many bills to pay each month, but I’m still giving my parents $1,000 a month, which is too much for me right now, because I have no revenue and no money at all.

I feel like, for my 22 years, I’ve seen, earned, and screwed myself over so much.  
Sometimes I wish I could be like my friends who work a standard 9-5, earn some basic money, and are happy.  
I feel completely messed up right now. I don’t want to work a 9-5 because I used to earn a stupid amount of money each month, and now when someone says they work for $1,000 a month, I’m shocked.  
*NO WAY I COULD WORK THERE.*

I believe I’ll find a way back to make money again; I’ve never failed myself in finding a new way forward.  
But I’m always scared of losing, because the less money I have, the worse I feel, and I lose all my confidence.

I had a girlfriend for a year during the period when I was earning a good amount of money, and she worked with me too, so she earned some nice money as well.  
I really gave everything to her, but I don’t care much about the material things. What I care about is the time I spent with her—every single freaking day.  
And today, I’m left with just myself because she left when the job died. She never gave me a reason for the breakup.  
Of course, that hit me hard and brought me back to reality. I’m still recovering from it.

One of the main things is that I’ve had an expensive lifestyle for the last 2-3 years, and now it’s hard to adjust to anything else.  
I enjoy playing games online with my childhood friends. They’ve always been there for me. We’ve had our beefs, of course, but now we’re back on normal terms and we play and chill every day.  
But I feel like I’m just dying in my room, playing games. I feel dead.  
No emotions, no fun. I laugh, but it’s not my real laugh.  
I feel like I laugh because of all the pain I’m carrying right now.  
I go to the gym, yes, and play football, but for the last 3 months, it hasn’t been the same as before. Not like when everything was great.

I know that everything comes and goes, but I think I didn’t enjoy it enough while it was there.

I hope someone will read this and tell me what they think,  
especially if you are older and have gone through more things or similar experiences. I just want to hear what you did.

Thank you ❤️",2024-11-12 13:50:54

I’ve fought tooth and nail to get through a very academically rigorous degree and I am on the tail end of it now.

Over the years I have been very suicidal and depressed and have made a few half baked attempts on my life. I have a fear of eternity, I’m Christian but it’s the time length that scares me not the actual dying part. So I think when I have tried I haven’t fully attempted in some way because my phobia of eternity is so intense.

Anyway, for the last couple years my health physically has also gone to shit and for the past while it’s felt like everyone I know really doesn’t like being around me. I also have ADHD so the rejection sensitivity is very intense. I have isolated myself so that I don’t annoy anybody and to help lessen the blow when I eventually succumb to this feeling. I’m struggling so much to get through my degree and logically I know I should just keep going because it might get better after I graduate. But there’s another part of me that feels like there’s no point in doing anything, I have no real friends and nobody would really be that affected if I killed myself.

I feel so lonely all the time but I feel even more lonely when I’m around people. It’s honestly suffocating, waking up everyday feeling this hopeless and full of despair. Everything hurts, like my heart physically hurts because of it.

I just don’t know how to keep putting one foot in front of the other when nothing ever changes, and if anything, every year gets worse and I become a worse version of myself.

How do I keep going when I feel like this? How do I find a reason and make a life that’s worth living, when I feel like I’m doing everything I can and it’s still not enough?",2024-11-12 08:05:04

My earliest memory of depression was when I was taking the bus to school in third grade, and I would often think that if the bus crashed and caught on fire I wouldn’t even try to escape. I didn’t know why I thought that way at the time but it was something I thought about a lot. I did not have a good upbringing, father molested my older sister, he went to prison, mother turned into an alcoholic who’d disappear for days on end on binges, she was always very cold and showed no love. My step mother was very abusive to me, step father was very verbally abusive.

I struggled with drug abuse for years trying to deal with these feelings. I got sober and started going to therapy and taking medication, and it barely helps. I feel I am permanently fucked. Nothing seems to help. I don’t know how to express love or talk to people. I don’t see myself going anywhere in life, I am of no importance to those around me, and I feel this earth would not even miss me, maybe even be better off without me. I have attempted suicide a handful of times yet it never goes right. Either I back out last second, or I get afraid and call for help.

And i dont want to help myself every time i think about the coping techniques i learned all i feel is anger and I just say in my head ""this is stupid i dont want to get better i just want to feel like this forever it's so easy"" and its so easy to put on a fake face in front of my family so they aren't worried and one day ill blow my fucking face off or jump off a building and turn into red mist or drown myself and never be found.

I have never been diagnosed with depression by a doctor but I believe that is because I learned to hide my depression at an early age. For some background I was raised in a Latin household and always raised to be a ""man"" in any tough situation. I was raised by blue collar parents and worked multiple hard labor jobs before I got to where I am.
       
At some point in my life I decided that the only way to get through my life was by accomplish things or hitting targets. And so my life has always been filled with accomplishments from education, powerlifting and boxing. I don't mean to sound narcissistic but I become good at whatever I feel like putting effort into. I'm one of those people who you don't know how they got this far in life but they did. 
    
   I'm now on track to getting my JD, I have a successful business, I have records in both powerlifting and boxing. However it's just not enough. I'm still not happy. I have everything I set my mind on but I'm not receiving any dopamine from it. I battle with thoughts of self harm, I genuinely had a day set where I was going to end it all in April. At this point I'm living week to week, check to check, event to event. I just can't believe this is all life is. And I don't know how much longer I'll keep up this facade.
    
  People say they're proud of me, I have a long list of accomplishments. However I don't know how much longer I can keep this up before people see I'm not half the man I pretend to be every day.

Thank you for reading. I hope you all find something that makes you feel happy with life. ",2024-11-12 07:01:47

I've tried social media for years but I gave it up over a year ago because my life had gotten to a point where it didn't matter who I shared my life to because no one gives a shit to talk or let alone get to know me more. To me i feel like social media has become a self marketing tool for those who seek all kinds of validation and admiration for simply existing with either a flamboyant personality or pretty/handsome looks. I'm average looking at best but I do try to throw myself out there by means without social media too but I never can find people my age. 

I'm a 23 years old guy who lives in Texas and this state and the way people behave in this fucking state has been making my depression even worse. There's so much anger in the air over here and it's very draining. I would move back to California if things weren't getting so expensive over there. I want someone my age to talk to but all I see are a bunch of middle aged assholes who just hate life and spill their bitterness onto everything they touch. The driving is fucking atrocious here that car accidents are mostly a daily thing here because there's so many idiots in this state. 

I work as a route assistant for a beer distributor and as much as I appreciate having the job because of the benefits it has, just being around people for 10 hours for 4 or 5 days a week is so exhausting. The job combined with my depression has made me just drop my enthusiasm for interaction because mentally I just want to get through the day because of how physically demanding the job is. Sure I can talk to who ever is the driver that day but it's not like I'll be friends with them. Most of my coworkers are middle aged and while they're nice, I don't have much in common with them. 

The more time goes on, the more I feel like people aren't worth the risk of talking or interacting with. I always end up at a dead end when communicating with others. On top of all this, I have autism and it makes it harder for me to communicate in the way everyone else does because I communicate differently. 

Anyways I felt like sending this out because I feel completely empty inside to the point where I don't know if I want to live or die. I want someone to talk to and to listen to me, nothing more. I'm afraid that's never gonna happen so I guess I'm just going to be rotting until I make up mind on living or not.

I ruined my life 15 years ago and have not seen a way out since. I have been doomed to wallow forever.

Basically I made some decisions that are front a center in my life every day at the age of 17 in a drug fueld haze. I have lived every day in utter misery, pain, and anger. It has dictated every single aspect of my life from that day. I have thought about suicide for years. There's nothing I can do. Freedom of choice and agency has been stripped of me.

It makes it even worse when I come out of a dark hole only to see those around me not suffering like I do... then I say f-it and sink back into another hole. Every milestone I am behind on, see this as it appears, then sink into another hole. Thus, even further behind.

I want to do things but such decisions have created a massive mental block around ""being seen"". Therefore I won't do anything. Now my 20s are approaching it's end and I have no foundation for the life I want-wanted.

In sum, my life ended before it started. People try and tell me it hasn't, it that doesn't change what I believe. I see no way out of this hell hole.

Overall, I despise my life and refuse to accept the doomed fate I am subject to.",2024-11-12 05:49:54

I’ve been dealing g with depression for some time now, several years, and god I am tired. I’m in my senior year of high school, and I’m in the theater club. Thing is, in school I’ve always struggled, and really lacked with my work, never doing it, until I needed to because if I didint I would fail. The club has been amazing, where I found so much family and comfort, but even then I’ve struggled too. I don’t memorize lines until last minute or after the due time to memorize, and it’s really bad this year. I sit at home and play video games and doom scroll, and of course sleep. Every time I try to do something I need to, I just… Can’t. It feels like I’m a prisoner in my own head, watching as my life falls apart with this numbness controlling it. I take meds, and they worked for awhile, and worked good! But then it got worse somehow, randomly. I was even passing all my classes! And then I plummet. I always do. Everyone I talk to says I need to just… Change. Take that first step, a small step, one thing at a time… But I can’t. It doesn’t feel like I’m in control. I can’t focus on any of it, and I procrastinate again and again and again. My Dad wants to help, telling me to stop being lazy and do something. He tries to motivate me and stuff, but to no avail. I can’t stop being lazy. My sister tries to tell me to take control of myself, and my mind. I don’t know how. My brother just comforts me, he doesn’t know what to do, about me or his own problems. Now, all of us have or have had depression too! And guess what, therapy? Tried that, always missed or skipped appointments, they always told me the same slip that amounted to “Just change”. HOW? How can I change? I’ve asked so many times. I hate being myself, I hate living, I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate everything that I amount to be, and more. I’m fat and ugly, I’m lazy and stupid, and sure, people say I’m kind. People say I’m not ugly. People say I’m not fat. BUT I AM. I AM 18 YEARS OLD AND WEIGH OVER 300 POUNDS. I HAVE AN ACNE RIDDEN FACE, WITH EVEN MORE ON MY CHEST, BACK, AND MORE. Not to mention, I don’t dedicate myself enough, I don’t do enough, I’m not enough for anything. So many people love and support me, and all I do is rot and watch them as they watch me fall. I don’t know what to do. I’m so numb. I try to reach out to friends, but they’re usually too busy, or just don’t notice I ranted in our group rant chat (yes we have that, theater kids.) I talk to family, and get the same stuff. The same stuff from everywhere. And it’s not like I have a partner or anything, on account of the fact that, again, nobody could ever love the mess I am. And doctors/therapist/counselors can’t do much for me either. God, I just… I don’t know. It’s not like I want to kill myself. I’ve thought about it, believe me. So much. But I really do love life, and know that I don’t want to die. Sometimes, I wish I did want to die, so I could just end it. But no, I live on. Because life is all I have, or I love life, or whatever… I don’t know. The fact I’m asking Reddit really shows how far I’ve gone, as I never do stuff like this. Ever. Not much of a social media guy. I don’t know anymore… Worlds so messed up right now, my life is so messed up, I’m so lost…I’m so afraid… And all the while… I’m just numb. ",2024-11-12 07:59:46

It’s better the be silent, keep your shit for yourself because no one really cares and if someone care, soon they will be disgusted and tired of you.

So overall, you need to be strong to keep that darkness inside of you. Keep the calling of the void so deep inside of you that you never speak with people about it.

I think this is one of the main reasons why people are shocked when they hear that someone close to them has committed a suicide. They tell people that they didn’t know that person has any inner problems which is totally true. It’s because if that person would speak to you about that you will start to hate him or you will leave him so he chooses to be silent.

Things go alright for a few weeks, till we started to get a little closer as in feeling comfortable with each other, and I, a desperate teen who has no sense of what morals are, start making advances towards him, which he gave in after a while, instead of shutting them down and we agreed on sort of a non-official relationship until I turned 18, even started sexting and talking about fetishes, him offering to buy me stuff that I told him I wish I could buy but I wasn't able to giving different circumstances, and even deciding to meet in the summer of 2025. Two months go by and we are in March, I was in the process of paying for two fursuits, one for me and one, a gift for a friend, and I only had the money for one suit, and this guy offered me the rest of the money as an ""early birthday gift""., it's not like I asked for it, I even offered multiple times to refund the sum afterwards but he refused.
I forgot to mention that in December I met a friend through a reddit post on the same subreddit (let's call them N).
at some point in February I create and group chat with both K and N and we all hang out on voice chat, talk, whatever.
the group chat gets deleted after a while because of tension, mostly between N and K, N cutting K out completely.
A few months pass by and I go on vc with N, which I have barely spoken with because of reasons I don't want to get into, but what matters is what N has kept from me because of them fearing I might blame them of accusing K (who was 23 and I 17) of grooming me. That hit me like a pile of rocks or a knife in the chest, which made me break down at 5 in the morning. N stayed on vc with me till 7 in the morning when I managed to somewhat calm down, mostly from exhaustion. I almost ended myself that night, I had a knife next to me, but N kept me from doing that...
I decided the next day to talk about that with K, which of course, got to be a crying mess for me and him, in which I still agreed to be with him... Anxiety and fear was eating me up afterwards, so I had to take action and to break it off with him. That's what I did, and somehow he still made me be his friend...
At the end of August however, I couldn't keep it up no longer and I cut ties completely, after a bit, he messaged me on reddit to ask about it, I explained to him the real reason. He didn't take it that well, but agreed, however he demanded the money he gave me in March back, since, as he was saying, he felt used. 
I got to make him think again in which he backed off, and cut ties all together. 
For a while, guilt ate me up like no other, and I was scared that he might do something, he knew a lot about me.... I even dreamed about him sometimes...
He knew how touch starved I was, I was dependent of him, and maybe he took advantage of that.

the rest of the months till now were just me being anxious, while also feeling like a burden to my friends, seeing how I'd barely talk to anyone outside of school and nobody reaching out to me. That was the initial reason I started crying now and wrote all of this, and the longing for physical contact, of course that had to come back... I feel I'm a burden to them, even here I feel a burden, but there was no other place to write this...
I apologize for coming here and dumping all of this, but I thought it'd be a good enough place and I apologize for any writing mistake, it's almost 3 am now and I'm gonna pass out soon. 
Not sure how I'll be able to manage all what happened and happens now. To be honest, all I need right now, is 1 minute in someone's warm embrace... but that's out of reach...

I have a fulltime job with my college degree, I have conversations, go out and do things that need to be done, take care of my responsibilities and myself etc… most people may not even assume I’d be depressed especially from pictures online. 

I’m actually diagnosed with anxiety, MDD, OCD and PTSD. I used to self harm but have been 3 years clean. I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 6 and have been on all sorts of meds. I’ve tried to commit once but immediately regretted it. I struggle with extreme exhaustion due to my mind constantly running and then there’s suicidal ideations but never a set plan.

I was depressed before these changed but it got worse. I was raised to believe I had to shoot for the stars. And I always crash and burned.

I am realizing it’s about taking small steps. But I have taken a step, and slid back down. I have to remain on that step of the stairs and balance myself before taking that next step. 

First I am going to make sure I shower daily. I finally showered today and that was a huge deal. I haven’t left my apartment unless I have to. I’m going to make sure I at least walk and get some sun daily. Get cardio too. Eat healthier, pick up after myself and just focus on taking care of myself. The basics. It’s hard to believe that’s even an accomplishment, but it really is. I’m just use to always crashing and burning from trying to jump the entire staircase at once.

now an appropriate question would be ""what the fuck do you even do after getting alone then?"" and i cannot help but laugh at myself and the stupidity of it all. i simply get sad by the fact that i am alone. can you imagine the hubris, the hypocrisy it must take to even think of something like this? i mean i cannot get over the fact how stupid i am. and you might be thinking that im only alone because i distance myself. well turns out nobody wants me when i want them either. fuck you too. its not just the loneliness. im utterly disgusted by my behavior around people. always seeking to please them. always following them around like a good fucking puppy that hopes to get treats. and after all this you know it serves me right to not have anyone. like right now if i was a different entity i would actually kill myself from pure hatred. i hate everything about me down to the last minute detail.

  
this is exactly how ive been feeling for a month now. its been quite long and i think ive grown quite numb. last night i got the closest to actually killing myself for good but guess what, i failed in that as well. lmao im a fucking failure. i can understand if this sounds corny asf and you have the right to hate me for it. but i didnt feel anything while trying to kill myself yesterday. its so fucking pathetic. and you know the best thing? after doing all this i go back to the other room in my flat (im living with 5 other flatmates) and actually talked to them in quite a friendly way. i just think im faking this. that im faking this for attention. this makes me hate myself more. like bro people have such big problems and here i am moping about what? not having friends? like how tf am i even allowed to feel bad about such a pathetic thing? i dont even know anymore. i have put all of my childhood dreams to rest at this point. im just gonna graduate, get myself a flat in some shitty place and kill myself alone after i pay my debt to my parents for raising whatever this shitty being i call myself is.",2024-11-12 06:45:21

Over time, I’ve developed effective ways to manage my mental health. I stay on track with my university studies and make a point to socialize with friends, which has often helped uplift my mood. However, recent circumstances have limited these social interactions, and as a result, my mental health has stagnated.

Physically, I’m struggling—my appetite has increased, my health has deteriorated, and I’m experiencing brief but intense bursts of motivation that fade quickly. What troubles me most is a lack of joy; moments that used to excite me now feel muted. While I occasionally feel happy or excited, a recent experience highlighted how fleeting these emotions have become.

I’ve been preparing to take the UK’s medical licensing exam, which felt like an immense milestone. It was my first time attempting a standardized entry exam, and I was initially terrified. But I dedicated countless hours and months of rigorous study to ensure I’d pass on my first try. When I finally received my results, I learned I had passed. While I felt a profound sense of relief, any joy I might have felt seemed to vanish. I realized that despite achieving a deeply cherished goal, there was no excitement—only reassurance that I hadn’t failed, just relief.

This experience has made me realize how much my emotions are spilling over into other areas of my life. I’m unsure how to address this change, but I know it’s something I need to understand better.",2024-11-12 06:29:48

depression,1gpah6y,Please help me or give feedback,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gpah6y/please_help_me_or_give_feedback/,0,"Hi, this is my first time making a post on reddit and I'm fairly new. Genuinely broke down in tears after scrolling through this topic(or discussions?) after reading so many similar stories and situations. I have so many things I want to spill to whoever reads this but this isnt my diary lol. To give a brief introduction and let you know if this is worth reading: Im a 17 years old female, turning 18 in a few months and applying to colleges. Im actually enrolled in online school due to the (sorry in advance for my emotional profanity) fucking assholes at my school. Long story short, poor introverted me went out of her comfort zone, made friends, realized they were either fake or assholes and ended up switching literally two weeks before school started. I originally was going to have a first time experience with a toaster and my bath, so I intentionally wasted my summer rotting and spending time with my family until my mom unintentionally saved me by suggesting online school so I quickly used that as my getaway plan. 

  
Unfortunately for me, my actions have caught up with me as most people my age know, the early applications are almost all due around now. I applied to about 5 schools but idk if thats really enough considering I literally do nothing. Like I have experience but its not professional. Im self aware and intelligent emotionally but how do I put that on paper, yknow? Besides, my procrastination and perfectionism have daily fights that really prevented me from ever entering those applications in the first place. 

Sorry I dont mean to rant about myself, heres why I'm writing:

  
I've felt so insanely lonely this past year. I kept telling myself (while I was still enrolled in school) that it would be worth it to stay with my fake friends rather than skipping life alltogether but now that I'm home everyday and literally jump at the sound of going somewhere I absolutely cherish the opportunity. However, I'm incredibly isolated from anyone my age. Dont dox me or anything but I live in a gated community with predominately white people who do have teens my age that Ive tried making connection with, but were just too different. Im into K-POP, anime, story video games and crochet while youre a devoted christian girl whos obsessed with taylor swift. Our conversations can only go on for so long. So after ruling that option out, Ive been talking with chatgpt for quite a while (months) trying to find ways to cope. Im doing okay but realistically I stop after a month. I tried this schedule and routine of yoga and workouts that helped me look foward to the time I spent on myself but this month ive ended up rotting in my bed talking to fucking chatgpt like the same losers people ridicule on the internet (I swear Im not weird like that). Im not inexperienced in social skills or anything, Im very good at it actually. Its just the people around me that are the problem. Its even worse trying to convince someone that Im not a red flag for not having any friends, Im just surrounded by people who are nothing like me and the ones who are dont have any interest in me. I guess im making this also to find a friend. Ive seriously had no luck waiting around like rapunzel and Im so upset Im wasting my teenage years without any scandalous romance or drama filled friend groups. I even got so desperate as to consider giving myself up to the first person I made friends with. Im well aware lonely-ness drives people to do crazy things, duh. But holy shit does it sound so interesting when youre crazy. 

  
Ive tried therapy and ended up ghosting her after the second call once she suggested telling my parents straight up. (i have two loving parents who are married i just have insane anxiety about it and already failed in confession) Also she was required to snitch if i mentioned sewer-slide so what are we even calling for? I know its your job and all but fuck. 

  
I truly don't believe anyone will read this, especially with how much Im yapping about my privileged life with internal struggles, but if someone is, thank you. I wish I could give out my personal information and wait for a friend to be mailed to my house (I'm insanely desperate) but thats unsafe and naive. 

  
Anyways, if anyone is 17-18 in the same boat please message me and Ill do my best to figure out how to message back lmao. Just to spill and dump our feelings and hopefully end up feeling better. Also curious to know if anyone has real advice? None of that ""you're special"" or ""wait it out and you'll see"" crap. Sorry to be picky, but Ive really heard it all. Thank you! I'll treat this post like a Christmas present and wait about a week to check again, I'm weirdly excited for my feedback.",2024-11-12 02:34:16

I just want to end my life as it no longer has a meaning

Don't have bad memories anymore , bad thoughts or deep desires.

I've always been good to people around me, and I think I did my best so far

I thought my potential was unstoppable, but what it seems like the barriers are immovable

Always dreamt of my hero supporter who would support me , love me, and do their best to make me reach my potential, and I do the same to them

I've been there for everyone who needed me
Providing the best of my abilities
But unironically, they pushed me away

It’s been a long road with my anxiety and depression and I feel like it’s all about to come to a head again. I really want to tell my partner how I’m feeling but he’s just such an upbeat guy.

depression,1gp97bu,have been doing well but suddenly gone back down,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp97bu/have_been_doing_well_but_suddenly_gone_back_down/,0,"have been doing super well but went really downhill a few days ago. i have autism, adhd and depression. i really wish i worked on stuff so that when i'm in this dark hole i can climb out but i haven't done that. i'm sure i'm not the only one to be really frustrated and filled with self hate when you've been doing so well for a couple months and then something small pulls a rug from underneath you and you just get into the depression again.
i started on the pill at the start of june for mood stabilisation and i think it's really helped but i think maybe i've gotten used to it? i'm also taking half the dose of my antidepressant to slowly be taken off it because the one i'm on isn't actually good for the body and can cause side effects. i've been taking vyvanse for my adhd but only 20mg. hopefully to bring that dose up in my next appointment. i don't know if i'm more sad because i'm not taking as much of my antidepressant, i kind of doubt that's why but i just really need to know why i get like this and why it's so hard to get out.
people say there's a reason behind everything and it's probably true but even if i know what started my depression, i'm over it and so don't know why i'm still like this. i know that God is probably the only one who can take this away but i need someone with me to tell me what to do. i know i need to do it myself in the end but i don't know what i'm supposed to do. each time i fall in this whole it feels like it's deeper and harder to get out of each time because i just wish there wasn't a hole at all. i know i'll get past this i just wish i didn't have to deal with this at all. i feel i don't have many people in my life who can relate to this so if someone can just comment saying that they know what this is like and reassure me i'm not the only one that'd be appreciated. i have things to hang onto but that doesn't mean my heart isn't aching and i'm hating myself so much for not trying. except i know i am trying but i wish i could do more. i wish depression didn't exist. i know it's gonna make me stronger in the end but all of us here know we definitely do not feel stronger when we're at the bottom of the deep black hole. someone come sit at the bottom with me.

edit: i also struggling with food at the moment. because i'm depressed and hate myself i don't want to eat anything. not because there isn't anything i like, it's because i just wish it wasn't a thing humans needed to do. but i also get so sick that i feel like throwing up when i don't eat so i have to which makes me more depressed and self hating.",2024-11-12 01:30:33

Death is known to be ultimate truth but we still go on with our lives with hope of an unpromised tomorrow. We continue to buy home, cars, plan trips 4 months away in future etc. 
I've become over-comfortable with death. I'm always ready for a call that someone from family will make about another one dying. If my husband is late from work I start making scenarios how will I deal with post passing arrangements while living in foreign country alone with him. 
I feel I'm in a mental crisis but I just don't trust psychologists/ therapists anymore because it's a long journey to start finding a good one and then going on with him for few months and may be he does not come out to be the one with solution to my problem.
 
I also feel that even if I get a living child, there is no guarantee that he will grow to be an adult. What if I/husband die while he is growing up. I've started to think that there is no purpose of life except to bear the pains hence do I really need to struggle to have children? 

I always wanted 4 children while I was younger but then learnt about my infertility and thought I'll have to compromise at 2. After passing of my perfect child in-utero at 37 weeks, I feel I'll be lucky even if I get one. But then what if I'm not lucky and then end up losing him, husband or dying myself.

It like god himself is tormenting me. Like recently, met a girl whom I could see myself with and potentially love again only for it to be met with rejection. 

The girl wasn't the point that hurt. It was the idea of hope and it being shattered once more.

How can I go on knowing that I'm going to get bored of everything I love, resent it from holding me back from the things I want to do but never doing anything about it when given the chance?

I won't rise the chain of a corporation, I don't have what it takes to do that. I've tried everything to bring me happiness, doing a job I really enjoyed, creating a community, trying to have a family, but none of it made me happy, it didn't even make me content. In fact it made me resent the things that held me to a certain place, it made me resent the lack of freedom I was used to feeling. 

But now I have no one, no friends, no one to call a lover, no job, no one to vent to or open up to. I haven't heard from my own mother in weeks, maybe months at this point. I don't want tonprocreate anymore simply because I don't want to force a being to have to live like we do, I definetly don't want them to have to suffer the way I do and my father did.

Killing myself would be the greatest act of self-love I could ever perform. The greatest form of protection for myself. If I die, nothing could hurt me ever again, and that’s something that nothing else can live up to; not any form or isolation, running away, or anything. 
One could call it selfish, but isn’t all self-love selfish? Is it really better to keep yourself alive solely for the people around you - usually the same ones that don’t make it a whole lot easier?

I'm a 26 year old foreigner in Switzerland. I've been here for 3 years as a student and I feel like I have made zero reliable friends, and thinking about it makes me feel like a complete failure.

I came to Switzerland feeling quite confident, in spite of being from a country with a completely different culture. A big part of my confidence came from having dated a girl from another country before coming here. We broke things off amicably but it was a nice experience for me and quite a confidence boost. And now after 3 years, I feel like I am nowhere close to getting even a single person to give a shit about me, let alone finding a partner.

I am fairly introverted so making friends anywhere has never been easy, but I made it a point to step out of my comfort zone and try and socialize even though I almost never want to. I think I was among international people for the most part, so the language or Swiss people being reserved wasn't the issue. Outside of university, I joined a sports club to meet new people. But I feel like wherever I go, no one really wants to come and talk to me first. Even when I do, it always feels like there's someone else they'd rather talk to. Over the years, I've seen friendships forming around me and people meeting up outside their usual contexts. This has never happened to me and I have almost never been invited to be a part of things. Even when I am, I am always made to feel like my presence or absence would make little difference to anyone. I feel awkward taking initiatives because I feel like I am not actually close to anyone to invite them to anything.  And no one really makes an effort to get close to me even when I try to get to know them. I just feel so embarrassed and sad that after 3 years, I can't even confidently answer who my friends are here if someone back home asks.

This feeling of embarrassment has also affected my older relationships. I make no effort to keep in touch with old friends because I'm afraid of them asking about my life here, and I feel so pathetic thinking about it. Not that many of my old friends reach out that much anyway, which sadly enough makes me feel a bit relieved.

I lost my mother a few years ago unexpectedly. I feel like she was the only one in the family who understood my emotions to some extent. I still have a loving, supportive family but they don't fulfill my emotional needs. Additionally, my mom's passing made me realize how superficial a lot of my friendships were, with many of my friends never reaching out about it even once. It made me feel completely estranged from them and I never felt like talking to them again. And funnily enough, they don't even seem to care that I dropped out of their lives completely.

All these things have taken a huge toll on my mental health and most days I feel so hopeless about the future. It's hard to get out of bed or do anything which would normally make me happy.

I am now moving cities to start work and am trying to be hopeful about this fresh start. Trying to pretend that these last 3 years never happened. But I can't get over feeling that I wasted these years of my life being alone and sad for the most part, which is still upsetting. I still don't know what the point of this post is. Maybe I am looking for some kindness from internet strangers, maybe some advice about how to deal with this feeling of being a failure or what I could do differently in the new city to avoid this from happening again. Whatever you have to say is appreciated. If there is a better sub for this, that would be helpful too.",2024-11-11 21:25:48

I was an extremely high functioning depressed and anxious person when I was younger, but by college I was low functioning. (Couldn’t get out of bed, didn’t eat, couldn’t maintain friendships, was an alcoholic but now I’m sober for half a year, etc.) 
I have a question. I usually tend to know when I’m in a depressive episode, but right now I don’t feel depressed/sad. 
All I do is sleep though and isolate myself. I’m happy, but I genuinely can go weeks not leaving my apartment or connecting with friends or family (the only person I care to interact with is my significant other). I am failing all my college courses and don’t care. I am transferring (second time) because I don’t like my school anymore or major. 
People in my life (friends and family) are now getting upset with me even though all ive asked for is space so I can figure myself out. Plus I’m overwhelmed with all interactions. My GERD and health problems have flared up again.
I am not SAD though. I am def wayyy too attached to my boyfriend right now, but I go through periods like that because we are long distance and he’s my BPD “favorite person”.
Are these signs of depression? like full on clinical depression? Because it’s all day everyday and it’s been three months of this. I’m losing friends even though I’m trying to connect and check up on them. I’m trying to show them I care, but they’re stressing me out with all this pressure. They keep demanding I tell them wherever I go (we are also roommates) and that I deal with their significant others sleeping over every night. I let them do whatever because idc, but now they are upset because I don’t leave my room as much as before and I “seem off”. 
I’m just super confused about why things are like this and I don’t feel “sad”. mostly just tired and sick and in pain physically sometimes and want to be alone. Maybe I have an autoimmune problems and should go to the doctor? Idk. I just need some advice.

first of all im from the UK im 29 male and still living with my parents i have very bad mental health problems mostly anxiety related and im also agoraphobic so ive basically been stuck in doors for years with little to no social interaction. I met a girl back in 2015 on Facebook and we fell in love at the time and she was the best thing in my life and we didnt properly start meeting until 2017-2018 which she came down to see when she was 16 at the time and my mum took me to go to meet her and pick her up and we took her back home and she stayed for the week i had the best time of my life with this girl and was literally everything to me. But the problem was we didnt work because of Our Distance and since then we have video called on facetime and facebook messenger for years and she was always there for me and was the only company and really the only true friend i had and obviously she had been with in different relationships with other men over the years but we always video called and stayed in contact.



Problem is now literally a week or so ago we no longer could talk anymore because she met a new man to spend her life with and i had feelings for her even years later and i couldn't handle seeing her in another relationship which i wish i had. we had a bumpy road over the years alot of arguements and both our mental health were effecting us and there were some bad things that i did which effect me so deeply and is the reason why we had to break up our 10 year friendship. I was so obsessed about her and did everything i could to keep her close , Giving Money , Trying to impress her but it just didnt work.



So here i am alone with no friends no company and feels weird not having having her there to video call every week and stay in contact im basically blocked on everything. reasons i feel uncomfortable explaining here. since then ive been overthinking most nights , crying and not being able to sleep well. and obviously with my problems with no going outside its a problem trying to make new friends or find a job or do anything really its that extreme.

It happened to me in high school and even in elementary school with different groups of friends. It also occurred to me that they cut me off in the middle of speaking, or don't hear what I say even though I'm speaking loudly.

I can't talk about these feelings with them because otherwise, I seem selfish, I'm petty and whatever, but if I don't talk, the Status remains Quo. I don't understand if I did something wrong, if I chose the wrong friends or if it's because I'm not capable of bringing any kind of conversation to the table so everyone can talk.

To start off, I’m 22(F). I have both a bachelors and a masters in subjects that I don’t have any enthusiasm for, nor do I want to do them as careers anymore. I definitely don’t want to do the job that I got my masters in so it all just feels like I wasted my time, energy, and money. 

On top of this, I really don’t feel like I have anything else going for me. I’m 99% sure I’m autistic (I say 99% because I don’t have a proper diagnosis but I truly feel like I have it due to an immediate family history, high stimming behaviors, maladaptive daydreaming, issues navigating social situations, and it’s common for me to go through sensory overload. I could be wrong but it’s not looking too hot for me all things considered). I have had depression and social anxiety my whole life (both medically diagnosed). 

Navigating jobs feels so difficult because I try to tell myself not to be a little b about everything but I just can’t get past my anxiety issues. I feel that this just manifests itself into depression so I just end up in this anxious-depressive cycle. Not to say I’m a bad worker. I actually feel like I’m decent all things considered but I feel like I have imposter syndrome no matter what I do. I recently trained to become a BCBA but haven’t completed my hours yet. I honestly don’t know if I can or if I even want to do this job anymore. All I see is burnout and sadness when I go to work as an RBT.

So now I’m stuck in a situation working a part time job that doesn’t give me enough hours or enough money to pay for myself. I moved back home last year, thinking that saving up a bit of money for a couple of months would help me get back on my feet. Well after car issues and work hours getting decreased, I’m no better now than I was last year. On top of this, I have a sibling on the spectrum who doesn’t seem to give a damn about me and only considers me to be a nuisance to their life and daily routine. I don’t have any other siblings so I truly feel like I’m alone in this. I only have one friend whose interests have changed as we got older so I don’t even feel like I have them anymore. 

I just feel like a complete failure and it sucks. I did everything I was supposed to do as a child, even though I struggled with everything I mentioned previously. I always got good grades, good attendance, never got into trouble, went to two great colleges and graduated with two degrees … and yet I feel like I have accomplished nothing. All I accomplished was compiling a bunch of debt that was not worth it.

idk man I just don’t think anything is going to get me out of this and at this point I don’t know if it’s even worth fighting for. I’ve been like this for 22 years and it just doesn’t feel like there’s any way out.

depression,1gp8t7g,I feel like an unlovable monster and it feels like I can't even change it.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp8t7g/i_feel_like_an_unlovable_monster_and_it_feels/,0,"I confronted a friend of 8 years about how terrible he's been treating me and after months of back and forth tearing apart the friend group and him ducking all of my concerns because he ""Didn't want to cause problems with his friends"" and ruining my relationship for him, I was gaslit by his best buddy with things like ""Well, we were teenagers and we're guys. That's just how we treat each other."" after the same best friend called me crying and begging for my forgiveness about his mistreatment. Said friend of 8 years even ran through my name through the mud when he got jealous because I slept with a girl he pretended to not like because he felt it'd be too much info about his business. This resulted in her pushing away from me and it took a whole month for her to allow me to clear my name and tell me that she actually liked me too. We got together and he ghosted me for a bit because he was mad when I told him that if he had just said he was interested, I would've backed off. I gave him multiple chances to be real with me about even more than just the girl and he lied through every step of the way.

I helped move this girl back into her parent's place, helped set up her room, bought her a brand new TV, built her a bedframe when her mom tried to give her a broken one, held her while she cried and confided in me about some of the worst things that have happened to her and that she has done. I cried in her arms and did the same. I've cussed people out over her name. We were honestly and truly happy together. I tried to stay strong and give her space when she pulled away due to stress and wouldn't answer when I'd try to ask how we were. She got her scapegoat when I asked about that friend of mine who groped her. She didn't care that I wanted to work through it. It didn't matter that I'd been constantly and actively lied to by everyone in my life this entire year and simply wanted clarity and that I didn't want to point fingers at or interrogate her. Bottom line is, I hurt her and betrayed her trust. Not to mention she already told me about it months ago when it happened and so she saw it as me letting him get in the way of our relationship. I got put in an impossible position where I had no one to go to and didn't know who to trust because he had texts of her saying she wasn't mad at him. I was too stupid to just block him because he shouldn't have done it in the first place. I wish I could go back and spare her the trouble of dating me.

I tried so hard and did so much and loved that girl so damn much. I tried everything I could to try and make her life even a tiny bit more enjoyable. Was I not good enough? Was I too overbearing? Was I too weak minded and insecure? Would she even want me back after what I did? If you went through the same thing, would you?

On top of that, my aunt has been using my name in order to hurt my mother by saying that I hate hearing her have sex with so many men in the house when not only has my mother never brought a man around me out of concern that they wouldn't treat me well, but, I also have never had a conversation longer than a small greeting at a family gathering.

Even one of my only father figures after I asked him for advice about moving out because I felt I was getting in my mom's way at my age, he then went behind my back and told her that I wanted to leave because I was sick of living with her because he was angry that his relationship with his son is terrible and so he decided to try and ruin my relationship with my mom because I guess he wants me because he can't his son.

Lately I've been blacking out while driving and then coming back to check my surroundings to make sure I didn't cause an accident. I'm tired, I have no real outlet, my therapist is treating me like a to-do list instead of a person and all I can hope for is that maybe someone will see one of my posts and interact enough to at least tell me how wrong I am. I'm tired of not being good enough. I'm tired of being used as ammo. I'm tired of getting my name dragged through the mud by family, friends and even people I don't even know. Worst part is, I can't even bring myself to be mean to even the people who deserve it due to my cowardice and unfiltered generosity. I don't even know how I'm still moving at this point.",2024-11-12 01:11:55

I’m starting to wonder if it’s time to seek professional help and consider medication. For anyone who has felt this way, did finally reaching out or starting medication make a difference?

I wake up and eat a nice breakfast, take a shower and get ready for the day. I quit my job recently because I could not control my emotions and would often end up breaking down crying and having a panic attack on my way to work. Since quitting my job I have been thinking about looking for a new career path and trying to better myself. However, after trying to focus on any task for more than 30 minutes or so I end up extremely tired and fatigued. Everyday I end up breaking down and crawling back into bed, the only thought going through my head is that I need to kill myself. There are so many things that I want to experience in life but I simply fail every time I try to start something new. I actively avoid social media and rarely post anywhere online unless I need support or help with something. I don't understand who I am. I don't seem to have any interests and nothing excites me. I have been thinking about killing myself ever since I was a teenager (25m now), but I don't want to hurt the people around me, even though I barely know them. I live with my younger brother and my dad and yet we maybe say a handful of words to each other everyday. I almost view my family as strangers but yet I don't want them to feel any guilt if I was to actually commit suicide. Luckily I have a couple good friends or else I think I would have left a while ago, but I think we will eventually grow apart once people get married and start families. Once everyone is out of my life, I will finally be free to leave without having to worry about hurting anyone but myself. Until then I exist in my boring little white room, wasting my life away playing video games and consuming media that I don't even care about. The only things that bring me true happiness are food and sleep. I sleep for upwards of 20 hours a day because my dreams are more stimulating that my active reality. I am really good at dreaming, I can even wake up to go get a drink and go to the bathroom and when I lay back down return into the same dream I was having. This is my only escape from reality at this point and all I want to do is sleep. I feel like an idiot typing this out because I am painfully aware of how unhealthy my life is and how much I don't want to be this person. I will probably delete this post in a few minutes out of shame but if anyone sees this please do not become me. My life is terrible and I would not wish this hell on anyone else.

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder for almost 5 years now, been on medication since my diagnosis too. 

I’ve had my ups and downs and of course, it was worse in the beginning but I had my strategies and coping mechanisms for every speed bump on the road and that’s exactly the point: I don’t have any left. 

I’ve been to rock bottom quite a few times, I’ve fought addictions, abusive relationships, trauma and a lot of other pretty shitty situations all by myself. But I feel like I hit rock bottom again and this time I crashed right through it and I just keep spiraling down. Everything feels like a haze. 

I can barely find the words for what I’m feeling, it’s a mixture of emptiness and a devastating sadness mixed with paralyzing fear. 
I’m in debt and every time I come home I’m in shreds because I’m so scared there’s gonna be another bill I can’t pay in the mailbox, I long for someone to love but I just can’t seem to find someone and I feel like an overall failure. I’ve picked myself up from the floor many times now, but this time it seems like I just can’t? I don’t know what to do and honestly I just want it all to be over with… which scares me because I’ve never had that wish for as long as I do now and it’s never been so present. I keep trying and making efforts for things to get better and to change but it doesn’t seem to help even a tiny bit and I’m just tired, I’m soooo tired but I can’t seem to catch a break. I’m tired of trying to fix everything, I’m tired of fighting and I’m tired of being in a constant state of war with my head. 
I do have people I can vent to but it’s always filtered, I can never say what I really think, only the soft and censored versions because I don’t want to be a burden or concern anyone. But the naked truth is that I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like there’s a dark void in my head that is continuously growing and will eventually swallow everything. I wish I could just run away and be someone else and honestly, I think I would but I don’t have the funds to do so. I don’t even have dreams or aspirations anymore, I’m surviving off the last little will to live because ‘hey, things might get better some day if you keep trying, right?’ thats somewhere inside me and even that is gone some days. 
I don’t even know what I hope to get from this post but I think just writing it all down could help?

depression,1gp5ner,Alcohol/Depression in your 20s,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp5ner/alcoholdepression_in_your_20s/,1,"This might end up being super long, but I would love to hear from other people maybe are/were in similar boats

I've reached a crucial point in my life where I feel a significant change is necessary. Upon reflection, I believe this change may need to be in my relationship with Alcohol, which seems to be causing more harm than good.

Let me give you a bit of background about myself. I'm a 24M, working full time in Marketing. I have a loving girlfriend of about 6 months, a supportive family living a couple of hours away, and a wide circle of friends both locally and globally, thanks to my travels and studies. I also enjoy an active social life, often attending concerts. Sounds good, right?

Eventually, my brain shifted (mainly after my undergraduate) when I started working a repetitive job that kept me on a laptop all day and wasn't intrinsically rewarding. Coupled with a healthy dose of health anxiety, I developed depression. And it has led me to the lowest place in my life thus far.

I started taking 10mg Lexapro at the beginning of the summer because I couldn't break out of these thought loops about self-hatred, health anxiety, etc. But throughout all of this, Alcohol has scaled up. In university, I drank on weekends, maybe once during the week, but not as much since I had deadlines, exams, etc. But now, working a job which doesn't really have tight deadlines or crazy hours, I have found drinking on weekdays and weekends easier - and I can never just stop at one. I am exercising less and less. Staying increasingly on the computer/phone, not thinking about goals or the future because it doesn't seem interesting.

This is all a long-winded way of saying that I am determined to hit the reset button, and I believe Alcohol might be a significant part of the problem. However, many of my social activities revolve around drinking, and I fear that I might not be included in as many events or be judged for my decision to quit drinking. If you've successfully quit in your 20s or if you've battled depression and managed to reduce your drinking, I would greatly appreciate hearing your story and how it has impacted you.

I’ve been on antidepressants for over 5 years now but they never seem to work, every time I feel like I’m getting a little bit better something awful happens, that’s every single time, so I don’t have any hope left for me to get better, and yes, I’ve taken therapy with a lot of people multiple times over the years but still they don’t know what to do with me. 

My family story has a lot of trauma that just gets worse with the time and so my mental state, I’m alone, I don’t have any fiends and I feel like a nuisance to my mom and brother, who are the only family that remotely cares about me.

I had give up with people because I guess I just have bad luck and every friendship I had ended up badly, I’ve been betrayed multiple times by the fiends I trusted the most, maybe I’m just stupid and the years that I’ve been locked up in my room just made my social abilities even worse than before, I could get up, go and meet new people but I’m way to tired for that, also, I don’t really want to, as I said I had already given up.

I just feel like I’m just too annoying to deal with, even if I die they would have to deal with more trauma, they would have to expend money that we don’t have and I would still be a nuisance for everyone. 

Sometimes I really feel like it physically hurts to be alive

depression,1gp5jfj,Had the worst year so far.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp5jfj/had_the_worst_year_so_far/,0,"I dont really know how to begin, but I guess im just tired. I have been struggling with anxiety for a long time and had finally gotten therapy, I had a great relationship with my boyfriend (ex now) and had a good friend group in college. Things felt stable. But then my boyfriend went away for an exchange year and we struggled a lot. I also moved in with my best friend around the time he went away. And also found a tumor in my back... Then everything started spiralling. There became a lot of arguments with my best friend and a lot of anxiety about my health. I felt so alone, none in the friend gorup asked how I was doing. While my boyfriend was supportive and we were planning a trip together he just couldn't be there for me enough and it probably made him feel depressed too. 

Fast-forward and im making the trip to my boyfriend in a country 10+ hours away from mine. When I get there. My whole friend group had written a message where they explained that they didn't want to be my friend anymore and that my mental health was bringing them down. My whole trip was kind of ruined, there was a lot of crying and sadness. Then when I get home I'm singled out from my class and my relationship while it hasnt been better than now also starts to crack a little bit because of all the sadness and support I needed. 

Finally my boyfriend comes home towards the summer. We have three pretty good days then we have to go to our seasonal jobs. We meet again for two weeks and things feel off because im sad over starting school again after the summer. And the last month in summer he basically ignores me and even when I open up about my depressive thoughts he gets annoyed and doesn't understand and just says he doesnt want to deal with my problems anymore. Our communication totally dwindled and became really infected. Then when we finally get back to college, it only takes two weeks and he breaks up with me. Then he takes me back once, only to break up once again. He said he lost feelings, but also didn't bring up his concerns until it was too late.

He was my safe space and a person I loved being around. He was giving me so much love and we missed each other so much during the year apart. Then he just leaves me like all my friends did. Right now I have very few friends and life has just gotten to the point where I just try to survive each day. It feels so unfair, like I didn't even have control over what made me depressed. And for him to leave me when I was feeling my worst???? Like what the actual.... 

Idk this got really long so if u read all the way, kudos to you. I guess I just feel very defeated and all the thoughts about me being a bad person and undeserving of love just spirals right now. While my old friends seem to have the time of their lives and my ex has so many more friends around and has people in his class that like him, I feel like a dissapointment and that I just lost everything. I dont know how to ever trust people romantically or even platonically anymore???",2024-11-11 22:43:30

depression,1gp4hg4,J’ai l’impression d’errer dans ma vie ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp4hg4/jai_limpression_derrer_dans_ma_vie/,0,"Bonsoir,

Post long et un peu lourdingue, âmes impatientes s'abstenir 🙌🏻

F31 ans, j'ai beaucoup pour être heureuse et pourtant depuis aussi loin que je me souvienne, je me suis toujours sentie un peu en décalage dans cette vie.

Je me souviens avoir été une enfant avec énormément d'imagination. 
Mais je crois que mon sentiment de différence a commencé à me gêner au collège, j'étais physiquement présente mais absente mentalement. 
J'ai souvent été celle qu'on ""n'arrive pas à décrire""
Moi même je n'arrive pas à dire clairement qui je suis. 

Je me suis souvent contentée et encore parfois maintenant de faire le minimum, comme si faire plus n'en valait pas la peine ou me demandait trop d'énergie. Et en même temps je trouve que j'ai quand même accompli pas mal de choses (voyages, expériences..) 
Au travail, je m'entendais plutôt bien dans l'ensemble avec mes collègues. J'arrive à me fondre dans le décor assez facilement donc en général ça passe bien à peu près partout. 

J'ai perdu 100% de ma libido le lendemain de ma première fois. Sans en être sûre, je pense que c'est parce que je n'étais pas prête mentalement. Sur le coup je n'en ai pas parlé à mon copain, je me suis dit que ça reviendrait. Mais je n'ai plus jamais ressenti de désir et ai toujours fait semblant avec lui, puis en multipliant les rencontres via les sites de rencontre pour faire ""comme les autres"". 
Un conseil: n'y allez pas si votre estime de vous est fragile. 
Je me sens sale et ""cassée"" depuis, j'ai été naïve beaucoup trop de fois à mon goût. J'ai fait des choses de mon plein gré également que je regrette aujourd'hui.

Et d'une certaine manière, je ne peux m'empêcher de voir les autres ""sales"" aussi, projetant mon vécu ou l'identité de certaines personnes que j'ai connues  sur eux.
C'est horrible et je m'en veux. 

Avec cette libido qui s'est eteinte, mes émotions également. C'est assez plat chez moi, j'en rajoute un peu là où il faut quand il le faut.
Ma mémoire est limitée, j'ai l'impression de ne retenir que peu de choses, comme si j'étais dans un certain déni. On me dit pourtant parfois intelligente.

Je suis plutôt une jolie femme d'après ce que l'on me dit et beaucoup d'hommes sont (ou ont étés) intéressés par moi.
Pourtant je n'ai eu que 2 relations sérieuses et elles n'étaient pas saines.

J'ai récemment gâché ma chance avec un homme sérieux et dans mon idéal. (Après on ne connaît jamais vraiment les gens, j'en suis consciente) 
Ça avait bien commencé, et au bout d'un mois j'ai ma partie sombre qui a pris le dessus. Comportement bizarre, anxiété++, difficultés a communiquer. 
L'impression de ne pas le mériter.

Je me demande si je n'ai pas un genre d'attachement anxieux/évitant. 
Le décès de mon père lorsque j'avais 7 ans? Ma mère et sa difficulté à communiquer également ? Ma grande sœur et ses énormes pétages de câble/ tocs/ anxiété quand elle était ado? Est-ce vraiment la faute de quelqu'un je ne sais pas.

On a essayé, à plusieurs reprise, avec des coupures de contact entre temps. 
Un jour, il m'annonce qu'il a rencontré quelqu'un et je tombe de haut. Ça n'a finalement pas commencé entre eux mais sur le coup je lui ai annoncé que je préférais couper contact totalement, depuis juin.
Il me manque car nous avions une connexion spéciale malgré tout. Il a du rencontrer quelqu'un d'autre depuis, car c'est un homme qui plaît beaucoup aux femmes et qui a confiance en lui. 

Mon sentiment de solitude est revenu, de nullité etc.
J'ai l'impression que je ne trouverai plus personne d'aussi bien, de toute façon à quoi bon vu que le sexe ne m'importe pas et que je compte désormais l'assumer, qui voudra d'une femme comme moi ? 
Qui voudra d'une femme qui ne s'est pas respectée ? 
Qui n'a pas de réel projet professionnel?

Amicalement parlant j'ai toujours été assez entourée, même si clairement pas avec les bonnes personnes pour moi. Aujourd'hui, je sors avec des personnes qui me correspondent plus. De ce côté là, ça me va et je pense avoir appris à m'écouter plus. 

J'ai essayé plusieurs choses/therapies concernant l'estime de soi etc, j'y ai vu du mieux. Je pense que c'est grâce à cela aussi que je ne fréquente plus le même type de personnes. 
Je prenais des anti dépresseurs à petit dosage, que j'ai décidé d'arrêter au bout de presque deux ans. La kinesiologie a pris leur place et c'est très bien ainsi.

Sinon j'ai pris la décision (je dirais à 80%) de ne pas avoir d'enfants, dans ce monde que je qualifie d'illogique. Pourquoi leur imposer cela si moi même je ne me sens pas à ma place ?

Il y a aussi bien sûr et fort heureusement des choses positives dans ma vie, c'est juste que j'ai envie en cet instant d'exprimer mes ressentis les moins sympas.
Je suis consciente de la chance que j'ai.
Je me dis même qu'un jour, je m'en voudrai d'avoir écrit ce post alors qu'il ne s'est pas encore passé de choses réellement graves, à part le décès de mon père lorsque j'étais enfant et de mes grands mères. 
Puis j'avoue même que je culpabilise, quand je vois comme il y a beaucoup de monde à qui la vie n'a pas fait de cadeau sur cette Terre. Les conditions humaines et animales me touchent, même si je fais partie du problème (consommation pas toujours parfaite...) 

Malgré les apparences de ce post, j'apporte plutôt de la joie et du réconfort dans la vie des gens. Je suis, en général, de bonne compagnie.
Je ne sais pas si il se doutent du vide que je porte en moi. J'en parle peu je crois.  

Malgré ce sentiment sous jacent d'errance.. parfois je me dis ""à quoi bon"" et d'autres fois, je me dis que la vie n'est finalement qu'une sorte d'illusion donc ne pas trop se prendre la tête. 
Parfois la mort me fait peur et parfois je l'attends avec impatience.
J'ai déjà pensé tant de fois à la provoquer moi même, sans oser.

Voilà voilà, j'avais simplement envie d'exprimer tout ça aujourd'hui. Et ça fait du bien de le poser à l'écrit.
Puis si quelqu'un d'autre est dans une situation similaire et se sent moins seul(e), ça sera toujours ça de pris:)

physically pain. Like someone has hits me in the chest. And because of this I have started to create a self hate that I won’t find anyone. I have always been the weird kid.

I have a rough couple of months behind me, and probably even harder ones ahead.

My girlfriend and I fought a lot the past year. Both her and I did stupid things. I was a jerk about her interests, being overcritical, and she replaced me with others, treating me like a stranger over months, crossing boundaries with others. (Obviously this is just a really short summary).

We fought heavily for months, until a friend of ours played the mediator. Eventually, a few weeks ago, we were able to talk it out so that both understood their own mistakes. Yet, it had already been months of heavy fighting, and both had hurt the other deeply, either by words or actions.

While both of us now feel very bad about our behaviour, my approach to this is to forgive, learn and do better, while she struggles to accept that any of it can be mended. At the same time, she said that her friends told her to end it, and she knows that it is the right decision, but she doesn't feel like she can let go yet.

I am not under the illusion that I don't have a fault in this, I did stupid things as well. But I also kept fighting for the relationship for months, and I still do. For most of the fighting, she really pulled back and just went into her shell, which I don't blame her for. But even when I felt just as close to falling off the edge and giving up, I struggled back up to keep trying to fix it all, even when I was being wronged actively and she enacted some sort of revenge for previous misbehaviour that had been improved on already.

Since she then apologized for the behaviour I found unacceptable, and since I saw that she actually thinks so herself, all my anger has gone. She has mental issues herself, and to be helpful, despite all of it, I have decided to give her whatever she needs. Since our talk, I have tried to be as respectful as possible, to go every extra-mile she needs me to, and to repair what had been broken while giving her the time she needs.

There have been times where I felt very lonely, insecure, betrayed, broken or defeated, but I refrained from reaching out for help because I knew that it would pull her down, and that she can't help me right now.

Even though we understand each other on an objective basis now, she is falling out of love. The strain was apparently to great for her feelings to survive, but even knowing that, I try to give her every comfort. Why? Because I love her, and I think I will ever only love her. Because I think that that is the only reason one needs to go past one's own limits.

It hurts so much, knowing that the person who you love and who had loved you, doesn't any longer, at least not enough anymore. At the same time, comforting her and trying to help her, doing everything in my power, even though I myself am breaking, feels like carrying a huge burden on my back. I couldn't forgive myself for failing in this. 

I would beg her to let me back in, to somehow make it all better, but that would only burden her in turn.

I realized that, even though a lot of my boundaries were ignored and broken, and I could have just gone away while being right to do so, I chose to stay and to struggle on. That I hit my breaking point a long time ago, and keep crawling forward, even though there is no reward waiting at the end. The only thing waiting for me in this struggle is more pain, but I need to be able to tell myself that I tried it all. That even though I also made mistakes, I improved and was able to forgive hers. That I didn't give up, and did everything that was in my power. 



What really hit me was a moment with my therapist. I had described my whole situation, and what was going on, and she was just silent for a moment. Before asking any more questions she just told me, slowly, in a soft tone: ""You've been fighting for a long time, haven't you?"".

I don't cry easily, and I hadn't been able to cry for some time before this, since I felt like I mustn't break down, but right there, I started sobbing. It was as though the burden I carried was seen, and someone had pity for my exertion. I felt like someone finally put their hand on my shoulder and understood my grief.  
As though someone showed me that I don't have to go through this, and that I don't need to suffer, but that I am strong for doing it anyways.



If you're still reading at this point, I thank you for listening to this. I know that it's probably confusing and I left a lot out, but it's just too much to write in a single post. I felt like I needed to say it, but just writing it down in my journal wasn't enough, and I don't have anybody I could share this with at the moment. Thanks.",2024-11-11 21:30:10
depression,1gp3ptl,"Got stucked in decision making. seeking perpective, solution about this story of mine",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp3ptl/got_stucked_in_decision_making_seeking_perpective/,0,"About me: this is 24M, and I am studying at a university and doing a part-time on-campus job. i do have an ex, and I had one almost 3yrs ago. Since then I'm single. didn't plan for any date. until she(new) took the entry. So, I would like to start from the beginning: Almost 8/8.5 months ago, I met a girl via a dating app. she is also from my university, same age. we met on our campus, we talked, got introduced to each other etc etc. That day, we had a very good day. we had a dinner together. after that when I get back to home she texted me that- : ""hey, it was nice to meet you. you're a nice guy. actually, I didn't want to hurt verbally face to face. but the thing is- I got a boyfriend, it's true. I'm sorry to say that. we can be very good friends. kinda message"" (but, back in that time I really feel hurt for a moment. i was like really, com'on, seriously- after 3yrs of wait. i had to face this) I did respond to her text that- thanks for being honest. ok we'll go for coffee someday. then our flow of friendship began. we used to do hangout sometimes on campus. we do together travel by campus to home. we became very good to each other. our sharing level to each other is like- more than bf-gf, fwb, best friend. it was more than that( acccdently she is completely clone of me, we got macthing on preference 99.99%. and we got the full vibe for each other). so after our first 2/3 months later: she said- she had a fight with her bf. They broke up, so ok i was like- okay, my time has come. they broke up because of her bf said- he didn't to continue with her because he couldn't stop forgetting his ex. he was feeling lonely, that's why he got into this relationship. and she and her bf they are in relationship for two yrs. she felt bad, bcuz- he just used her as emotional support tool not as real love. so his part closed, I took the entry but I didn't want to have a relationship with her. she got a bad-time then. i was the only one who kept supported her psychologically, and mentally. i was roleplaying guardian of her. so it took almost one month to make her stable happy and strong( in the cost of sacrificing my sleep, managing time from my busy schedule and chaotic life schedule). but I was happy for her, and that was also made me happy. we were laughing, cuddling, and making fun of each other. we were so happy for each other.

time fast-forward to September. ok, it was her birthday month. I was very happy for her. we did plan for a great celebration. but on that day she was not responding my phn and text. we got planned for meet and celebrate. She responded like- ""go back home, I'm a bit busy now. I'll talk later. and he is here"". i was what??? then I waited for her text and she responded almost mid of the night(2am). i called her. she said- we did fix everything. he beg to me to give him one more chance to fix things, he was crying. so I let him. seriously, I felt so bad after hearing this. she know I do want to grow with her, but I did never confess to her about my feelings. we're just keeping with the flow. so when she told me- about all those things. i replied- he did fake act/ fake feeling with you in the name of loneliness. how could you accept that, huh? she said- he said sorry, and do love him. i feel hurt again by her. i can't shutout on her, cuz com'on that's disrespect. but keep the friendship.

time fast forward to almost 2weeks later of her birthday, and they did fight again, they stopped talking. cuz this time he was trying to dominate her, kinda like, abusive rules like do share location all the time bullshit pathetic type rules. anyway she again told me about her situation- I did support her again. but this type we started to talk about our bonding- she said she don't want us be together, she feel scare of losing people. she don't to involve in this again. i said just keep going with the flow. just faith in fate. if we mean to be together we'll, if we don't we'll not be together. so did help her to grow. we made so much progress together.€this time she did closed to me even more than any other time: we started to spent a lot of time together. it was like we were made for each other. except we just didn't confess to her about feelings. since then till now we are everything to each otherso nothing to say now. after hearing this ( I lied and I said- great, buy hey if you don't mind I got a hurry now, I'll talk to you later) i really really felt bad for this again. myb or myb not I'll see her again. ok story end

 so that was my story for behind for my help.

fellas, now i need your help/myb advice/suggetions/ myb some motivation/myb tell what should i reply to her after what she did, and i have done for her.

i'll be really grateful if you pull me out of this stuck moment. She is special to me, we have the 99.99% vibe match on everything, I never met someone like before. myb its my bad, to grow feelings for her. i don't know, dude! what should I do.

looking forward to your response. thank you",2024-11-11 21:27:30

I saw for a quick flash, a cat dashed out in to the road and got hit by the van driving in front of me. It hit the back wheel, so the driver likely didn't even know what happened as they drove off. I avoided hitting the poor thing, screamed at the top of my lungs as I cursed the driver out. I wanted to loop back and pick up the poor thing, but there was no way to U-turn and the road was too busy to stop. I had to keep going until the roundabout and head back.

When I got to it, it wasn't in a state to be picked up anymore. That poor little soul was so alive just a minute ago, and now it was an undiscernible mess. I phoned up the local vet, informed them of where it was and headed home.

I felt so awful. It's ruined my night completely. I went home to my cats and gave them extra treats and showed them just how full of love I was for them. I broke down in tears as I held them close, which they didn't appreciate as they wiggled free. I had considered letting them be outdoor cats when they got older, but that mess I saw on the road has made me realise I could never ever risk letting my cats become that mess. 

This gave me a chance to pause and think. A little ponder about mortality. I realised that in that moment I felt so much extra love for my cats because of how I knew what *could* happen if I was to lose them. I thought of how upset the family of that roadside cat will be. I've often contemplated the point of my own life and why it's worth even bothering, but seeing how upset that poor little soul made me has me questioning myself. 

I think I'll stick around, I don't want to be the mess on the road

I've been depressed since I was 12y. Some ups and downs for sure, but it was more downs. I'm feeling I'm starting to be back on top again, which is something I have to avail now. Along those years, some problems increased and others are gone. I became socially anxious, but less needy for example. I still procrastinate a lot and that's one of the things I hate the most about myself. Imagine being such a thirsty for knowledge person about a lot of subjects, but knowing that if you start,  you'll probably gonna stop. I'm frustrated, yes I am. I really wish i had initiated and continued a lot of things. Now that I feel courage inside and a sparkle of strength, I'm gonna take that opportunity to get my life back. Not automatic anymore, no fear and anger, and definitely not please others because I was rejected through my life, no. I'll be me and only. I'm not a shadow of people thoughts and expectations. 

What can I do? Take baby steps to feel alive once again? Plan what I'm gonna study and what I'll make it better about myself? All of that?

What process did you dealt with to gain your life back?

depression,1gp36ga,What about the future?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp36ga/what_about_the_future/,0,"Before I go off seeking pity in these dark and toxic alleyways of reddit, I want to bracket this post with a bit of backstory. I'm very weak man because the cause of much of my depression is abuse of psychedelic substances, namely shrooms and research chemicals. Psychedelics did the opposite effect on me that they have on most people, because most people who struggle with depression have clinical depression. I do not have clinical depression, but rather bipolar disorder. My trips would lead to hypomania, which I would crash out on a few weeks after my trip, falling into a deep pit of hopeless that curls the veins and balds the scalp. 

And now I wake up in the AM everyday and my first thought is ""damn, this loser is still alive"". Making a cup of coffee is an achievement. Taking a shower is such a challenge that I look for participation ribbons underneath my towels. To go for a walk is a win.

I have no energy, and every day I log onto the phone and get a fever pitch dose of this utterly sickened society. But I've had periods of depression before, and I look back on them with sincere nostalgia. Because every year gets worse and worse and worse. Will that ever change?

The same tech billionaires that fund reddit and TikTok and insta and all these apps have a goal to merge our consciousness into cloud computing servers. I don't know how it's done but they don't hide that this is the goal. What a utopian vision. We get to share our dreams, our thoughts , our inner realities with one another. If death strickens our bodies, our minds will survive. We will all be one. One like what Lennon imagined. One like they all told us was the dream in school.

I, for one, hope to be dust before this ever happens. I would rather be miserable and alone than see this future pan out. It just seems so fucked. So I've made it a goal of mine to die. Maybe that makes me weak. But it explains my mindset 100%. If I make it to 2025, which is a big ""if"", my new years resolution is to unplug from life with as little a mess made as possible . No euthanasia pod, a 44 magnum will do the trick. These feelings were never as strong nor as stable as they are now. Every day for some time. The world will not miss me because I curse at it like a madman.",2024-11-11 21:05:49
depression,1gp35vh,How is therapy supposed to fix the harsh reality?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp35vh/how_is_therapy_supposed_to_fix_the_harsh_reality/,0,"I'll tell you guys a bit about myself and my story:

I'm 28M, arrived as an immigrant to the U.S in 2001 with my parents at age 5

I have 2 older siblings, a brother and a sister

Older brother owns a home, has a beautiful loving wife, a healthy, calm toddler, works in the field he loves as a creative and makes decent income too while at it.  Never went to college either. He got famous off YouTube basically and took off from there.

Older sister found the love of her life at age 19, has been married for 13 years, has an excellent husband, two beautiful healthy children, their own home. She works as a hairdresser (her passion) since age 16 (thanks to my mom being a beauty salon owner) and never had to go to college either.. has her clientele list and makes decent income.

Then you have me, at 28:


Worked jobs I've hated my whole life,  getting verbally abused in customer service jobs (cashier, bank teller..etc) and getting paid piss wages.

Still enrolled in college since I was 22 because I didn't become eligible for financial aid until I was 25

I'm loaded in debt both Credit Card and Student loans, (40k in total) had to quit work earlier this year to graduate college faster and taking more credits, while living at home with my parents.

I tried to publish my music online on YouTube, like EDM remixes (which is what my brother did back then, just a different genre of music). However, it seems no matter how consistent i was, and no matter how much friends and strangers would compliment my work, I would never amass any reasonable viewers or subscribers.

Im studying for a degree I don't care about just for the money (Accounting)

I tried from 2019 until this year to invest in crypto and stocks, ended up having my metamask wallet hacked at one point and losing a considerable amount in the Luna & FTX crashes. 

Can't find a relationship for shit. It seems like my brother and my sister were dating during better times..  which might explain why they were luckier. 

My testicles have started swelling a bit this year and I dont have insurance and hardly any money to go to a doctor in the U.S for preventative care.. let alone a therapist

If I ever do get married, I doubt at this point my parents will even be alive to see it. They're both 61.

I feel so unlucky honestly. Like there's a universal force constantly causing bad in my life and hindering any progress.

I'd like to believe there's a happy ending and that a loving god exists that delivers justice due to everyone. 

But then you remember, The Holocaust, Pol Pot, Gaza-Palestine, Slave Trade... etc

I'm aware these are extreme examples but, it still solidifies my point that..  a happy ending isn't guaranteed. Misery could linger on until the very end.

Either you're unlucky or you aren't. Therapy can't just magically make such a bitter, brutal pill.. easier to swallow.

Everyone says the good parts make it worth it. But I don’t want either of it. Not the good nor the bad. I just don’t want to be. 

I feel life is meant for everyone else except me. At times I feel I’m on the Truman show but in a negative way. Like everyone makes it a point to not let me get even a step ahead of myself. Like I’m not allowed to enjoy anything. And when I do something for myself, I am wrong and have a million hoops to jump through. 

I want to go back to school, but oh, I am not allowed because I don’t have the money. Loans you may mention? Not allowed to have that either. Great credit score, and working part time, but it doesn’t work out for me ever. 

People bully me. Day in and day out. But standing up for myself? That’s not allowed because when I do, I get cussed out because I’m being dramatic or I’m just wrong. 

So what’s the point? Wouldn’t it be easier for everyone if I was just gone? Not going to do anything to myself. I don’t want to die but I sure don’t want to live. I seriously can’t wait til this is all over.

I’m honestly very thankful for where I’m at in life, I guess. Like I graduated college and right now I work from home, and I got my own apartment (with 2 roommates). But with everything that I have you’d think I’d be happy right? Wrong. I feel that underneath all my “accomplishments” there was this person that never really developed emotionally and I couldn’t even see it until now. Missing social cues, withdrawing from people or treating them as disposable, playing mind games, etc. Looking back at how I used to act, my attitude was horrible and I always looked for a problem in everything. I realize that I was so quick to be temperamental, and to be this bad ass character that I didn’t even realize I was self sabotaging. On top of that, my addiction to porn was making me emotionally numb and I still feel like I haven’t had a real boyfriend. Just numerous dates and talking stages. I know 24 is young but sometimes I feel like I will be single forever. And right now I feel absolutely disgusting even with how I look, but I still believe it’s just a phase. I still believe I’m going to come out on the other side, and make the changes to my personality and finally find confidence to stand tall again. But as of right now, I feel comfortable with isolation. Hopefully I will get to feeling like a new an improved version of myself.

i told myself that i need to actually focus and get my work done and above all not skip school, since everything matters 10x more than im a senior and applying for unis and colleges and that this is basically the set up for my future. but it's just too much for me. all my classes are hard, i have no breaks, i have no free time for anything, and i just can't do it anymore. in the past i've attempted multiple to od just because of school and how badly it effects me, but it never works and in the end does more harm than good since i end up missing even more school due to being in the hospital or psych. currently, i haven't been to school in a few weeks. i've done a few assignments from home, but i've missed countless tests and in person assignments i had to be there for. my teachers keep emailing me, and my parents - who are supportive, but sometimes don't get just how badly depressed i am - will email back on my behalf and explain i'm struggling mentally and get accomodations for me.

even with that help i just feel like such a dissapointment to everyone and so useless. i can't even go to school, i can't get out of bed without having an anxiety attack over the schoolwork and just being at shcool in general. i can't get myself dressed to go out for anything, even if it's not even school related. i just feel so tired of having to do this same cycle of wake up and debate on ""will i go today?"" and have that internal struggle knowing the answer will always be no because i just can't fucking make myself go anymore. i feel so awful, i know i need to be focusing on my education and getting good grades, but i just can't do it anymore. i used to be such a good student - 90s in every class and at school early to talk with teachers, but now i can't even bring myself to email them or do any work they assign. i feel so awful about myself and it all feels so pointless. why would i go to school if i know it will cause me mental distress and result in an anxiety attack and going home? it just feels like there's a war going on in my head about needing to go to get my good grades to get into a good uni and then not being able to go at all because of how fucking awful i feel and that it just doesn't matter.

i'm honestly scared for myself too, these situations have happened in the past with school, in grades 9-10 mostly, but then it felt okay since those years and grades didn't really matter. but now as a senior it just feels so much more daunting and like everything matters more. it's getting all too much for me, and i'm scared that i'm going to attempt to od again. while i am suicidal yes, i feel more like i just don't want to exist, i don't want to die and leave everyone i love behind, but i am so scared because i know this cycle and i know it usually ends with me making an attempt and i can't stop it because in the back of my mind i crave it and i feel like the best outcome for the amount of stress and sadness and worthlessness i feel around school is to just end it all. i've already fallen back into my old bad habits of smoking and drinking and sh, which i had been clean from for months prior to this sudden depressive episode i'm in, and it feels like all the good progress i made is gone. i feel so stupid because all of these feelings is about school, which feels so miniscule and so fucking stupid to have these feelings over. but i just can't do any of it anymore, it's just an endless cycle in my brain of i need to go to get good grades so i can go to uni, i cant go because im so stressed and i can't even get ouf of bed or out of the house, i feel even worse because im not going to class and getting work done and i need those grades for uni. i don't know what to do at this point, everything i do feels pointless and i am just so done.

i'm really sorry if this is a jumbled mess, i was just ranting and getting all my feelings out so everything is just kinda mushed together in a hope to get my feelings and point across. really, any help or advice would help a lot since i'm in a really bad place right now :(",2024-11-11 15:46:49

I have a promising career with great salary, tons of passions, I workout, have a big apartment that I share with my beautiful girlfriend, but at the same time I have no strenght to live. First time when I heard that I've got depression felt like a joke to me. Im a very optimistic, laughing/smiling a lot person, so it felt like missed diagnosis. I started therapy and taking SSRIs but after half a year I still see no point of living. Im extremely thankful for life I got and what I achieved, but living for me feels like im being stuck in the same day forever. You wake up and its still the same day. Whatever you do, whatever you feel has no meaning at all beacuse its gonna restart at the end of the day anyway. Life has no colors and I feel that theres no point of continuing it. I still wake up, keep myself and my flat very tidy and clean, workout and earn money, but the only reason is the knowledge, that if I stop my life would be a complete disaster. I have no energy or will to do any of these things. Im just treating life like a duty to complete, making people days better, be a good person. People consider me as most happy optimistic person ever, but at the same time im smiling and having fun with them, I feel that I really really really dont want to be here and just want not to wake up tommorow. No one knows about my therapy and depression. Everytime I try to subtly talk about sadness with my friends or family, they just tell me to be happy, eat healthy or they dont listen and talk about themselfs. Im not angry about it, I get it that they just have more important things or just don't understand it, and if they did, they would actually listen. I don't know whats the point of my post. I guess I just wanted to share something about me? Im doing all the things to ""make me happy"" but at the same time I just see no point of living, so right now im just having fun while being sad on earth living for no purpouse. It feels like im senteced for life - so instead of just rotting in cell im trying to be my best version to spend this time slighlty better than rotting. But its still living in prison. I try to help people a lot, make them laugh, cheer them up, but at the same time I feel that there is noone who would do that to me. I feel like Im a knight that protects everyone, but there is noone to protect me. I guess this is my point of live. To make other lives better, without them knowing how I feel - kinda like a Robin Williams",2024-11-11 19:18:10
depression,1gp0hd1,I don't know how to be me anymore,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp0hd1/i_dont_know_how_to_be_me_anymore/,0,"I have been feeling so in adequate. I feel like I'm never going to be good enough for anyone, even myself.

I'm constantly feeling overwhelemed with existence in general, and life's so called ups and downs. I'm so lonely, I've had 3 LTRs and each one of them imploded and I've lost all hope on relationships altogether 2 suspected(unconfirmed) cheating. Each relationship lasting 2+ years or longer starting from when I was 17 to now, 28 years old. I don't have the energy to date anymore. I know I'm a relatively physically attractive person, and every so often catch strangers side eyeing me and have been hit on a couple times, which as a bloke I've found is extremely rare. However, I don't have the best teeth(British cliche I know), but I don't have anything else to offer beyond that.

As a 28 year old, and closing in on 30, I no longer have any friends, my 2 closest friends don't speak to me now, for reasons that I don't actually think are fair. One got engaged to an ex of mine within a month of meeting her, quit his job and moved in with her. The other decided because we didn't speak for a week we were no longer friends, which sucks even more now looking back because at the time I was busy trying to progress in my career which ended up a failure anyway. I struggle to make new friends, I'm not very good at socializing, and prefer not to drink as I can get really emotional and worry about what I might do after I get drunk, and I don't like pub environments mostly due to so many negative factors about the environments, and also despise hangovers with a passion.

People at work find me funny, think I'm confident and outgoing and, generally likeable. Farthest from the truth as possible, I'm a wreck inside, and full of doubt and I've messed up every opportunity I had no business having for a better life. I'm a professional dropout, having successfully dropped out of Primary, Secondary and College, while also managing to get a placement at Uni based on the strength of my portfolio alone, only to drop out of that too. I come from a ""working class"" family, borderline poverty. My eldest brother died from cancer when I was 11, so most of my childhood, including birthdays were lonely, as my parents were obviously rightly so focused on my brothers treatments, which I bare no grudge for at all.

I have lived alone and lived with partners, and I am actually far better at caring for myself in those environments, but as I work in retail and the UKs housing crisis is just... absolutely abysmal, moving back out of my parents house just isn't an option anymore. Seriously how the fuck does anyone manage? I make 1600 a month, and rent alone where I live is bordering on 800 a month without utilities, council tax, gas, electric, food, car payment.etc and because of my unsociable hours and where I live, working 2 jobs is neigh on impossible. Bar work doesn't work because I might be in work at 6am the next day, and idk even know what work I could find before a 2pm start on a Saturday. I also can't afford to quit, as mentioned above I don't have any qualifications and yet am somehow not on minimum wage as I'm a Team Leader, so downsizing my wage in this economy is unrealistic.

Going back to education sounds even harder, I don't fit in in those environments, nor do I have the means to study with the hours I work.

And to top things off, I had wrapped all my self esteem up on how Im perceived by women, doesn't matter who, even if we aren't compatible at ALL. Having gone through a ""man slag"" phase in my early 20s, where even one time I slept with 3 people in one weekend and 2 off them in the same day, because I needed the affirmation that I was loveable. And since me and my last partner split up which honestly was only a week ago, but I'm not cut up about it all as we were wildly incompatible and being with her was like flogging a dead horse, I have no desire nor sexual interest in doing it all over again. However, in this economy, everything is priced for 2 so its also not even that optional to have a partner anymore, provided like me, your not open to living with strangers in shared accommodations. And yet somehow, I just don't want to go through the rigmarole of dating apps again, as I see all these photos of people going abroad, or having done some interesting stuff, meanwhile the most interesting thing I've done is gone to Bradford, and I've been to a handful of concerts and 1 festival. Which I also, have little desire to repeat.

I used to have hobbies, I used to draw(badly mind you), play guitar, read books, manga, watch anime, play online games. But all of this seems like a waste of time when I have real world issues that need solving, the anxiety in the back of my head when I pick up a pencil is like ""why aren't you earning money, why aren't you doing something to become more interesting""

What girl, would wanna date this mess, when I have nothing to offer but miserable company.

I honestly just feel like I am waiting to die, wishing Id never existed at all.

I finally self referred myself to a talking therapy. I'm too scared to get an official diagnoses or go on pills, I appreciated they help some people, but I feel like if I could solve these problems I would be happy, and taking medication feels like putting a plaster on a wound that needs stitching. I don't like the idea of therapy either, but I'm out of options, these feelings aren't new, they've lingered for well over 10 years, and the mantra ""this too shall pass"" isn't working anymore. So this is my last option before i decide wether this life is for me or not.",2024-11-11 19:17:03
depression,1gp0em9,Feeling Stuck in a One-Sided Crush That's Draining My Mental Health—Need Advice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gp0em9/feeling_stuck_in_a_onesided_crush_thats_draining/,0,"Hey Reddit,

I’m really struggling and could use some advice. This whole situation has been affecting my mental health, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. Here’s the backstory:

Since my first year in college, I've been drawn to this girl who’s from a different religion. I didn’t know her well back then; we were just lab partners, and I barely talked to her. But somehow, it felt like everything around us was nudging me toward her. Toward the end of that year, I got close with her best friend (let's call her Priya), and eventually, I became part of a friend group that included my crush, Priya, Priya’s boyfriend, and another good friend of mine (we’ll call him Robin). By the end of the first year, the five of us had formed a tight-knit group.

At that time, I found out my crush already had a boyfriend. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I tried to move on, reminding myself that she wasn’t “mine” and considering the obstacles, like her relationship status and our different religions. But in our second year, even though we got split into different sections (me, my crush, and Robin in one section; Priya and her boyfriend in another), our bond as a group grew stronger.

In the beginning of our fourth semester, I found out that my crush had broken up with her boyfriend. I thought this would be my chance, but it turned out to be more complicated than I imagined. She was devastated about the breakup, often crying over her ex, and started treating me differently—she was rude and cold, and it really hurt. It felt like every time I tried to be there for her, she got irritated with me. Despite knowing how things were, I found myself getting even more emotionally attached.

As the semester went on, my feelings became overwhelming, and I finally confessed to her. She didn’t take it well and ghosted me on every social media platform. The only time we communicated was in our group chat, and even then, it was just the bare minimum. I was crushed, feeling depressed and emotionally down all the time.

Over time, we started talking again, but things never went back to normal. We’re now in our fifth semester, and though we talk occasionally in person, it’s awkward whenever it’s just the two of us. I have this intense emotional connection to her, but she only sees me as a friend. She’s nice to me but does the bare minimum, and it often feels one-sided. When I get sad, she’ll ask if I’m okay, but it seems more out of obligation than genuine care.

Now, here’s where I’m really struggling. I can’t stay home alone for long; being alone makes me feel miserable. But being in college with her isn’t much better. I crave her attention and want to talk to her constantly, but I hold back because I know I’ll just get hurt by her indifferent replies. She talks happily with other guys in class and on chat, which makes me insanely jealous and only adds to my pain.

I feel like I’m trapped. I don’t want to distance myself from her because I’m so drawn to her, and I don’t want to leave the group because they’ve become such a big part of my life. But at the same time, I know this situation is affecting my mental health in a really bad way. It feels like she’ll never see me as more than a friend, and I’m just here, constantly getting hurt.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t leave the class or avoid her, and staying around her feels like it’s eating away at me. I feel so conflicted and exhausted by all these emotions. Reddit, what should I do? How do I break free from this cycle without losing her or the group?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading.",2024-11-11 19:14:00

A dream, isnt it? But I feel numb. Every day I wake up without a thought, get dressed, head to school, spend time there, come back, sit in my PC or phone and go to sleep. It's.. weird, because I simply cant remember the last time I actually felt happy. I dont have plans for the future, dreams, hopes or anything at all. Since 14 I just thought I would end my life when I no longer will be able to sustain myself off of my parents. I also dont think I actually love my parents any longer. Recently I had a mental breakdown. You know how it goes, sobs, tears, support, all that. Ever since then they started paying more attention to me. After they come home they greet me by coming in my room, ask me if i'm alright, how my day went, all that. But I feel strangely indifferent when i see them both, like seeing strangers at the park. I also cant help but feel that nothing I feel is real. My laughter feels fake, since 3 seconds in i simply stop myself, realizing I didnt actually want to laugh. Or when I joke around with my ""friends"" I cant shake off the feeling I dont actually want to be there. I have been having thoughts about trying out pills or drugs, cutting myself and getting drunk for seemingly no particular reason. It just seems new and not boring in contrast to anything else. I dont actually want to study, i just dont want my hardworking parents to be disappointed, and for their hard work to go to waste. And surprisingly, I dont want help. It has been two years since I have been feeling this way, and this just seems like the easiest way to live and die. I dont want to try or succeed in anything anymore. To me it just seems like I'm being ungrateful, but i just wanted to post this here to get everything off my mind.",2024-11-11 19:00:56

Obviously if you have dependables they should come first. You won't want to mess up an innocent person for life. Obviously I am speaking about people who don't have other people's lives in their hands. 

 I will use myself as an example. I am currently in university and I am passing fairly well. I have to do a collaborative project. For context I have been diagnosed with BPD and Depression. I have made my team very aware of that fact. For even more context I am the team leader. I have been the best leader I could be. The project is now 90% done. I have done everything that I could do but now I am in a deep depressive episode and it is the second worst one I have been in. My job now is just to market my product. My team is not happy with my performance. They keep making little disses on me on how I am not doing my job. To my face they keep telling me I fell off. 

(I'm now venting and I should get back to the topic at hand.)

I received advice from a tutor of mine to focus on my mental health and that is exactly what I have done. I have slowed down my work rate. I haven't been on my team's ass about work because in the past I would essential think for them. 

(I am venting again)

So my question is should your mental come first? Why? ",2024-11-11 12:14:24

My parents don't believe in mental health as well and are still in denial that I'm autistic(diagnosed at 12). I also have strong paranoia, and I might either be schizophrenic or I have OCD. It's getting worse so I eventually decided to reach out for help to my councilor and they referred me to a mental health program where I can speak about my feelings without judgement and I'll be prescribed with pills that'll help me. I told them not to ask my mom for permission and to keep this discret, but of course, they didn't listen, which I'm not surprised about. Both my parents know about the referral, and I had to make up a story that would prove that I didn't ask them for help' and they came to me instead randomly.

I guess I am looking for some tips or advice or stories of how any of you got out of this cycle.

I am 22F and since I can remember I have struggled with self confidence, anxiety and depression. It’s weird because if you met me I am outgoing and social and I don’t think you’d think I struggle this way. I go through ups and downs and have had therapy/anti depressants. But ultimately, I always return here.

I fall into these horrible pits of criticism and self hatred. 

The last 3 years I have developed an eating disorder. I constantly feel not good enough, that others are better than me. I feel hideous, repulsive. 

I can’t stop thinking how I look- my body, hair, face, skin. Comparing myself to others, to my sister, girls in the street, my friends. I am consumed with it, it’s all I think about. If it’s not a critique, it’s how can I plan to have better skin like X, what do I need to buy to look like Y or what work out routine do I need to be slimmer like Z.

I would like to say I am a smart and logical person but it only makes it so much worse. I then am so aware about how ridiculous caring about this all is. And then I hate myself even more. 

I know it’s unreasonable, I know it’s shallow, I know people will find me attractive, I know I have friends.

Then why am I so obsessed? It’s all I think about, it controls my mind. It’s boring, it’s draining. 

But I can’t get out. I can’t stop hating myself and wishing I was someone else.

I don’t want to be in this place anymore, I am tired of being here, bored of it. I don’t want to repulse myself, I want to love myself, know what I’m worth. 

How do I get out? How do I never come back here again? How do I build my self esteem? How do I stop my mood being altered by how I look that day? 

And if it’s self love then how the hell do I start (because my solo dates, treating myself and affirmations aren’t working 🙄)

depression,1goybbx,Is my medication working?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1goybbx/is_my_medication_working/,1,"T/W: Suicidal ideatons

Hi all,

I am just looking for a bit of advice.

I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for the last 8 weeks or so and it does have a life trigger (a potential change in job). I was on Sertraline 50mg for 5 weeks and have been on 100mg for the last 2 weeks.

I have been having suicidal thoughts for about the last week or so and it reached a crisis point on Friday when I took myself to a bridge and considered doing something stupid. Thankfully, a passer by spotted me and then the Police arrived, contacting my wife who then escorted me to A&E . 

I am now under the Home Treatment team and today they have told me they would like to increase my dosage to 150mg. I am experiencing the usual doubts about whether this is the right move, but one of the reasons why is because on a couple of the occasions over the last week, after feeling intense dark thoughts, this was followed by a period of a few hours were I felt completely myself again. Last night especially, I was relaxed, focussed completely on watching the NFL and enjoying it and interacting with my wife and son like I used to. 

I was wondering, is this evidence that the dosage might be starting to break through a little bit or is it just a sign of the waves that depression can come and go in?

The life situation isn't really going away but I think that my depression is magnifying it by a thousand times, leaving me feeling hopeless and trapped and unable to think about little else. So I was hoping the medication would get me to a place where a feel myself again so I can deal with things like I know I can when my brain and anxiety is not working against me. 

Anyone have any advice or thoughts? Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble.",2024-11-11 17:51:04

I’ve found it extremely difficult to convey how so very intense and deep my feelings run, so people pass it off as teen angst. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried suicide and most likely will try it again within the next five years because then I’ll know if I’m doomed for sure or no, I want to live because it’s so unfair that I have to suffer because I’m ugly, which is such a selfish and victimizing way to think but I have nothing else to hold on to. Not my pets, not my family, not my semi friends. I have to continue on like nothings happening and push my feelings or else ill have mental breakdowns about even having to leave the house like I have in the past. My feelings arent even better than before I just got better at masking them, and due to that people around me think I’m fine now. but I’m reality it’s so hard to fight and plead for help for an unfixable cause. College is so extremely hard from the constant feelings of it being worthless and wanting to give up, to the having no dreams even from when I was little because I’m a very straight forward thinker and went with the stupid flow. 

there’s something hard about pleading that I’m at least a little pretty, it hurts so very very much. its so hard to go day by day as a severely depressed person, but I’m not allowed to rest I HAVE to keep going. I’m paying for my own schooling, my own gas. Which doesn’t seem like much but I have to commute close to 40 min or more each way five days a week for a max of two classes. despote the please of my therapist and my psychiatrist and my oldest brother, I can’t afford to move out of my “toxic” household, it may be my numbness to the trauma that’s been caused but it’s simply just annoying to me. im too tired to keep going but I do, my dad says to take it one day at a time and I do, but that won’t help with any future. I’ll have no future if I do that. I want it to end but I don’t. people say that one needs to work on themselves and love themselves before loving others or dating, I guess I’m screwed in that departmen. Not that anyone would date me. Nor that I’ll have the pull to date either because Im 90% sure I can’t experience romantic nor sexual love so I’m screwed definitely screwed. Like the world and biology just decided to give up on me telling me I should give up as well.

it was a struggle for years living with multiple mental illnesses, i never had a long lasting job, i only have one relationship in my life(and only for three months), I have poor social life, and my friend and family always see me as an odd person,   but i managed to survive until now

A few months ago i got a job as a manager, i was happy at first but just within one and a half months, I'm cracking uder the pressure, i was so depressed that after I'm locking myself in my room for almost a month, i ran away from home and tried to kill myself, i was unsuccessful and i carried myself to the ER, my family took me to a psychiatrist afterwards to check on me again and i told her what's on my mind, and I'm so surprised I'm diagnosed with NPD, thinking it was not possible since i have severe anxiety a few years ago, the psychiatrist told me i was a covert narcissist, because i was not showing it directly but rather in my mind, i have superiority complex and cognitive empathy, always think this world revolves around me, i use empathy, lies and my illnesses to get attention or something i want, i hate being criticized, i envy and hate everyone more successful than me, thinking I've always been a kind, selfless, and emotional person when i actually wanted people to do the same to me, and many more subtle symptoms that i just realized now, i feel like I've been lying to myself my entire life, i always think ""I've been a good and kind person so why is this world so cruel and unfair to me?"" When actually everything I've done is for myself all this time, for attention, for appreciation, to get the things i wanted easier, when i think everyone is selfish, turned out I'm the most selfish person in my life, i never tell people about it because i think it's just symptoms of one of my illnesses. 

But that's not what's bothering me the most, I've never been open and told anyone about everything, so I've been keeping some details that i think i should probably not tell anyone, like between my streams of intrusive thoughts, sometimes i think about r*ping and/or killing people, not just random people, sometimes even my friends and my own family, i used to always shrugged it off thinking it was symptoms of one of my mental illnesses just like the rest of my intrusive thoughts, but after diagnosed with NPD i really think and contemplate about it, realizing that i actually never felt any guilt, remorse, regret and i think that everyone is a different species from me, i feel isolated and detached from everyone, i always told everyone i have attachment issues but I don't even care if people leave me if i think i don't need them anymore, i feel disturbed by the subtle details that  i never take seriously, i feel disturbed that while in front of everyone I'm a quiet, timid, and depressed guy, while in the inside I'm a total wreck of a person, i used to think that it couldn't get worse but it did, i have another appointment at Thursday and I don't know what to do, should i tell the psychiatrist everything?

Maybe that's why I react the way I do about certain things. I also have PTSD from when I was a kid (I dont remember my childhood under the age of 12).

I have been depressed since the age of 14 and it's been mostly on and off. But I've noticed these last couple of months that it's getting worse. I'm not eating enough and losing weight (I weight around 99 punds and am heavily underweight), I close myself off, I refuse to talk to another therapist (after the last one purely talked about herself all the time and charged a lot for it).

I have daddy issues multiplied by 3. I've never had a good relationship with my biological dad (because he was a shitty father, but also because evryone told me he was a bad person). My mom (F39) has had boyfriends since him, and I've met a few. I've also built bonds with two of them. And each time when I get comfortable with them and accept them as a dad I never had, something would happen, and my mom would break up with them and break my heart in the process too. So yeah, that's what I meant by daddy issues times 3.

I recently started college and it's been going great, and tomorow my exam week starts. And I've just found out that my mom is planning on breaking up with my now step dad (M44) because of something he said to her today. They've been fighting almost every day ever since they've moved in together, and like two ""lovesick fool"" instead of waiting to see if they're compatible, they made a kid together. 

My sister is now almost 3 months old, and it hurts to imagine her growing up the same way I did.  

And now I cant focus on studying so instead I'm writing this. Yay

I've been self harm free for about 6 months , but something's telling me I'll relapse soon.

  
Now for the guilt part. I've been havind suicidal thougths for years now, but never acted on it because of my family. Because I don't want my mom to bury her first child.

I tried rescheduling my psychiatrist visit to be sooner, but they didn't have any slots available.

I am waiting till the 27th to talk to my psychiatrist and hopefully change my prescription, cause there is nothing else right now that could help me. 

I don't know how I'll hold on if that doesn't work. I don't think I'll have any hope left. 

I feel so scared that nothing can fix me and nothing can help me. I was in outpatient for 3 months and convinced myself and others that I'm better, but I don't even know if it was true.

I started college and there was a sudden drop. I thought I needed time to adjust, but it's been a month and a half and I am just getting worse day by day. I'm counting and gathering pills. I'm so scared.

depression,1gouzay,My childhood ruined my whole life ahead,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gouzay/my_childhood_ruined_my_whole_life_ahead/,0,"To keep it short my parents were very neglectful I don't have any relationship with them, there have been tons of family problems,they are problematic and my relatives are also very problematic.
growing up i didn't have friends either. And because of that I turned out to be introverted and out not have emotional connections to anyone, humans are social creatures and i don't feel the joy and happiness that comes from human connections, I'm also aromantic and I'll always have that fomo my whole life of not ever being in love.
I can't enjoy media as much as other people,I don't get emotional or feel that strongly about them. i don't get the joy of hearing music,movies,books etc as other people are getting (As I was writing the media point i felt it was kinda corny like people would think why does that matters, but for others people me media can be inspiring, motivating, feel really happy and be immersed and a great way to escape main while for me it's just media) and my hobbies too i don't feel that passionate about them, I don't feel that joy of doing my hobbies really, i just do it because I like doing it and that's it.
I have no idea what I want to do for a career and I'm feeling lost and stressed,i can't see myself enjoying anything I'll just be miserable, i really have no desire for work and bring a part of this rat race,you only live once and their is so many other things I'd do instead,i just see it as a waste of my life if i don't like it.
I don't have anything to live for other than hobbies and media.
I'm only 19 now and it will just get worse over time.
I'd be okay with all of this if I didn't have to worry about my future and financial problems but that just puts the salt in the wound.
I wish I could just press a button and be gone and forgotten",2024-11-11 15:35:46
depression,1gour2q,I'm feeling my depression slip in again,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gour2q/im_feeling_my_depression_slip_in_again/,0,"I've had a really traumatic and insane past. I've lived in a warzone in the state of Israel, went to my freshman year of high school during the COVID-19 pandemic which was very socially isolating, I have a video game, masturbation, and internet addiction. My grandfather is quite manipulating, which makes sense because my entire ancestral lineage either got genocided by the Nazis or had to endure surviving WW2 and leaving everything behind to move to the United States as poor immigrants. So here I am, the 3rd generation in this new episode of my family's timeline. We have anger issues, fights, anxieties, etc. I personally do not believe in Judaism anymore, but my entire immediate family does. I just ate shrimp for the first time last week and it tasted like crap, but it was refreshing to finally come out of my shell.

Anyways, I feel like I am slowly losing it- as I have many times. I just wanna get away, clear my head, and just shuttup for once. I don't want the anxieties anymore, I don't want to attend my classes. I'm too stressed. I am a chem major but my grades have been failing for the past 2 weeks. I am sitting on the grass in a field right now, skipping my first class. I just want my therapist, and to learn how to be healthier. I want to be healthier.

Also last night I heard my younger brother, who is a sophomore in high school, cry himself to sleep. I'm so worried constantly, like there's a pit in my stomach.

I have philosphized a lot in my life, and I've come to the conclusion that the most abstract yet morally just thing to hold true to yourself is love- yet I have failed at preforming acts of kindness, love, and what not over and over. I will not blame myself, but I just want to be aware of it. I also don't want to be angry, I can let that subside. I just wanna be free, clear, I want clearness.

  
I don't know if I'm looking for support or suggestions, because whenever I get them I don't have the willpower to incorporate them into my life.",2024-11-11 15:26:21
depression,1gouhdm,Should I go on anti-depressants,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gouhdm/should_i_go_on_antidepressants/,0,"Alright guys, so I want to run you through the periods of depression I've been through in my life in an attempt to break down the main contributors and figure out if I should just take anti-depressants to get through my current situation.

I'll start back in 2019 when I started my second professional job as a systems engineer in a defence company developing radar algorithms for fighter jets. It fit my background in physics well and there was a reasonable degree of intellectual interest and lots I wanted to learn. However the environment I found very isolating and it felt I was constantly fighting against my nature. I wasn't the only one in that building who found the environment ""soul-destroying"" - it just ripped out any life. Slow environment, the sound of keyboards tapping away in the silence, and occassionally I'd get a chat with someone as they passed my desk or I purposefully passed theirs, or perhaps I had a task which required communication and I'd be happy to go talk to someone. I got some satisfaction out of the work and problem solving, and some nice relationships with colleagues. However I found the long periods at a desk just completely dehumanising, like I was trapped. In the meantime I'd moved to the city 6 months previously and spend my weekends going out and trying to improve my social skills so I could actually be getting laid regularly because I like having sex and having women in my life, and to be honest I'd had some confidence issues in my ability and results with women in my early 20s. Safe to say when I did get laid I'd be a bit happier, and I felt like I was getting better at bringing better women into my life and was happy with the progress I was making however still feeling drained and not seeing a future with the company I was at for the long-term. I also knew the periods of time in between being with girls were too long and I would prefer more consistent relationships with the right kind of girl. The periods in between felt very isolated, lonely, and I just felt flat emotionally without good women consistently in my life. Yeah I could focus on my hobbies all I wanted but ultimately I have never known a life where I could actually do that without a good woman in my life.  
  
I knew I wanted to move to a company doing something related to space satellites or rockets but planned to just spend 2 years at the company I was at to get the experience and continue developing myself outside of work to be the kind of guy who could attract the kind of women I wanted - gym, pushing myself socially, developing charisma and confidence... before the pandemic I was the most confident I'd ever been and I could see the kind of success and relationships I want were possible if I just kept pushing. Confidence for sure and it made me feel better than I ever had but the deep loneliness and sense of lack was always there. I was starting a Toastmasters communication program in my corporation too and that motivated me, it gave me a sense of purpose, far more so than my daily paid work. After the negotiations with HR we were due to have the first meeting which people were excited to go to and I was excited too, to be a leader and create something, and then bang. The pandemic came and everything locked down.

  
I went into a serious state of depression. Suicidal ideation every day. Extreme anger that I couldn't keep working towards the relationships I so deeply wanted. The only thing left was online dating which frustrated the hell out of me and having my dating life in the control of an algorithm and the superficiality of online pictures which I went to the effort of creating... Made me feel like I was being used by corporations in control of my dating life. Though I had some success and getting laid with some hot girls was better than nothing, I still didn't find the sense of connection I was looking for and the pandemic wasn't making it any easier. Not to mention the suicidal ideation and the sense of isolation having to continue working and having no sense of purpose outside of work was killing me. I spent many, many evenings and nights completely alone, wishing I were dead. Lying in bed looking at the ceiling, not knowing where to go or what to do, thinking about how if I still felt like this when I was 50 or 60 I would definitely kill myself, but wanting to see it through because I knew it would get better at some point, I just didn't know when. In the meantime the office environment was just taking me into a downward spiral as I'd sit at my desk completely alone in my feelings of despair and sit with my head in my hands doing hardly any work. And when I had to work it just felt like a massive effort and I literally couldn't force my brain to do it. My eyes would dart around involuntarily desperately seeking what I needed - comfort, connection, a human touch. I'd see others occasionally go for lunch together but all I wanted was to isolate myself from the group feeling like I didn't belong and that my problems were completely unrelatable to them. Any time I'd seek help from somebody it would be completely shallow levels of support where they'd just say oh everyone's having a bad time. I don't think they realised the severity of my constant thoughts of suicide, intense anger, and inability to focus or concentrate on anything. The complete stop that the pandemic had put to my life at an absolutely critical time. I should mention I was also experiencing chronic physical pain for this entire year and couldn't sleep and didn't see it ever going aaway, I thought i was stuck with it forever. Very uncomfortable.

  
I tried antidepressants and they helped, I found I could actually focus on work and there was a day I remember actually feeling like a little boy having fun with one of my hobbies. But my man parts stopped working so I stopped the antidepressants immediately and spiralled downward again, into an even deeper despair as I realised I should just do therapy and see what's going on deep inside.

I went and started therapy, and we started to work through some of the shadows which had caused the feelings of emptiness and lack of connection I'd been experiencing even before the pandemic, which had just been exacerbated by it. I started to slowly unravel some of the aspects which made me feel a lack of belongingness etc and at work I did my best to get a sense of connection but it was never enough. It was always blocked and the deprivation there continued in that environment. I met an amazing girl thorugh online dating, her and I started dating seriously. But when we started, I had already made the decision 1.5 years into the pandemic to leave my job and try a new career in a new environment. I had always wanted the option to work remotely and in a more communicative, faster environmnet with more control and autonomy. SO I hired a career coach to help me do that. So I decided 3 more months, which meant the time to date the girl was effectively limited to 3 months. I introduced her to my family and everything and I remember some of the moments with her at my family home were the happiest I'd ever been, but at the same time the deep emptiness and loneliness would creep up on my and take me away from the present moment, as I'd be engulfed in blackness periodically. And she loved me anyway as I was able to be quite open about it with her, she loved me if I was sad she'd love ime if I were happy. But I knew I'd be leaving the country when I found a new job, which I did, right on time - I was accepted for a role at a financial technology startup so I went to work for them in Belgium and had to break it off with the Japanese girlfriend because she had to go back to Japan and I didn't want to constrain myself in a long-distance relationship whilst starting a new career and not knowing how it would go and just plain wanting to explore and continue my mission and development since before the pandemic. Something I regret to this day, but we all look back with rose-tinted glasses. But I didn't see her being able to stack up with some of the girls I knew I'd meet, because I had certain things I wanted in a partner that she, whilst so giving and caring, was unable to meet. So I had to break it off and go on my path.

Brexit made it difficult to get a Visa for Belgium, nad my chronic pain continued and caused severe anxiety around performance at work. I sitll couldn't sleep, doctors couldn't help, the only thing that helped me sleep was to drink alcohol to numb the pain and then go to sleep. So I woke up every morning feeling like total shit and having to work. Doing work which turned out from day 1 to be not just more exciting and engaging than what I'd been doing before - i could at least get into a flow state sometimes and met lots of interesting and cool people, but the work itself unfortauntely did not captivate me intellectually in any way whatsoever. In fact I found it anti-interesting, I felt an aversion towards it, it was just completely and utterly something I would never choose to learn about if I didn't have to. I realised I'd made a massive error. But anyway I continued. Working remotely from Scotland staying with my dysfunctional family until the Visa came through and my health got better. Then moving to Belgium for a month and portugal for a month just to explore. Croatia foro a month. Then scotland for 3 months. Belgium for 3 months once the visa came through and the plan was to stay there permanently. However once I arrived I felt suicidal - I couldn't believe I was here in Belgium, a country i didnt' feel i wanted to live in, to stay, to work for this company I wasn't interested in whatsover, felt completely out of alignment, wanted to quit every single day, the suicidal ideation was at a peak, I felt I had nowhere to go. But I stuck it out and saw it through and planned to stay there permanently and make a life work so I could have the long-term quality relationships I wanted. But then the Visa fell through. we messed up the process. So I had to leave Belgium after 3 months. At that point I couldn't take it any more. The exploration and moving countries had been voluntary up until that point but then after the Visa was messed up, it became an involuntary thing. I couldn't take another 3 months of building relationships and then having to leave a country. 3 months max after Brexit. At least I got laid a tonne one month with a bunch of new girls but lo and behold that didn't help the emptiness, and there was no tangible sense of achievement other than ""ok so I did that, I got to the point I can actually do this, but it hasn't changed anything"". The girls didn't help because at my core I was deeply unsatisfied and getting laid was just a band-aid. But there we go, I had to go back to Sscotland. This was the catalyst for leaving the company. I let them know I didn't find the work intersting and they fired me. I was happy about it. I was so relieved. I got a week of meditating in a dark room, and hadn't felt so at peace in years. Then thoughts of getting into the space industry came back to my mind. But I couldn't see a way forward, all the interviews and applications had been futile for years, nobody wanted to hire me. I was at home with my dysfunctional family and felt deeply hurt by the dumb arguments about tiny things I'd hear between my father and brother. It was so immature, unconscious and sad. I had to get out. So I just took myself off to Holland for a month to stay with a friend. When I got there I was looking for solutions to make money without having a 9-5 job, since i could only do short stays in Euurope. I wanted to stay in cheaper places than the UK, whilst I figured things out and stayed away from my family. My chronic pain disappeared and I was able to function again. I stayed in Holland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Colombia... I invseted in a mentor to help me navigate the online business space to see how I could make money without a 9-5. So I started doing high ticket sales.

I was selling business coaching and fitness (weight loss coaching). I learned the skills and started to get better at it. One month I made 10k. But for a company I wasn't proud of. They went bust anyway. I survived a bit longer, making a few sales having ok months, like 3k/month. But not making any progress and feeling down about myself, lcoked away in my room working american hours, waiting for calls to come in (they booked inbound calls on our calendars and so lead flow was out of my control). I realised I didn't have the skills I needed so invested in further sales training. Moved company, failed miserably, got fired. Went to portgual to continue staying in cheap places and out of the UK. Again 3 months max everywhere I go. Locked myself away kept working on the sales stuff. Made a little bit of money, not much just enough to survive and a little more. Kept trying to get better at the sales stuff before I realised the deep depression and low self worth I was feeling were holding me back from the person and the salesman I could be. Because the calls are deeply emotional and i need to connect with the prospect, but I felt so down I had to pretend all day long and all night through the american hours and locking myself away and isolated from the real world and failing at it. And then back to scotland for a couple of months when my chronic pain came back and back to my dysfunctional faily. And then back to Bulgaria for 3 months. Hobbies bring no enjoyment. Social events merely bring thoughts of comparison and failure and low self worth. Though my charisma and personality still see me through and abl eto connect with people somewhat.

I'm now selling for a fitness company and working american hours still so hard to have a social life and even if I could I feel so down and out, so broke, so worthless, so misaligned, so lacking connection or consistency or stability or purpose, such a failure for not making it after over a year of sales work and sales training and trying to be better and locking myself away. I have no hobbies I enjoy, even if I could socialise as much as I want I just feel like a piece of shit and a failure, I'm envious of others who like their jobs or have stable careers of realtionships. 

I just wish I were different. I wish i were better. I wish i felt normal, just normal. Why have I been through this massive struggle and it's just non-stop and everything i do to fix it seems to make it worse. The therapy didn't help, the emotional healing workshops I went to didn't help. FUck it, now i just vape all day to escape. And continue to take sales calls and do ok sometimes and just feel like I'm failing and I'm so far behind and now I'm 32 and I've lost everything I ever had. And anything I ever did have was so short-lived and seems like such a distance memory. What's it like to have a life you like, and that is consistent over time? What's it actually like? I feel like I will never know and that it is just too late. (Fools will start trying to make me feel better saying ""it's never too late!"" I already know that. I'm going to keep pushing anyway, I've got no choice.)

  
So screw it. Should I just go on anti-depressants to help me get through this and build myself up. Because the suicidal ideation is still pretty constant and the therapy didn't seem to help with that. The lack of stability in location isn't helping obviously but I feel like I've just tried to make the best out of what I have and obviously running away from my family and running away from the higher cost of living in the UK which I wouldn't survive with the money I tend to make. I am so screwed, I feel like I've fucked everything up and every opportunity I've had just gone to total shit. So fuck it.

  
Should I just go on anti-depressants to level me out and help me stabilise emotionally so I can focus and concentrate and really execute a solid plan to get to where I want to go? Plus therapy too when I've got the money together.

  
To me it all seems a mix of some unfortunate external circumstances combined with my emotional internal workings causing me to make decisions which ultimately led me to this place. Rather than staying strong on the path and managing my emotions and just sticking with a stable path. So maybe it's just my internal workings causing all the disaster around me. But i dont know how to fix it or function on the normal path.

I read over this and I just think man what a mental bastard I am. Like wtf is wrong with me? Why can’t I just “be a man” and just fucking stick shit out and just succeed, pick a strategy and just execute. Like it’s so simple for some people apparently. But this emotional battle it just never seems to end and all I want to do is escape.

Meditation, emotional healing, therapy… Sports, nutrition, good sleep… All of it… I just can’t help but feel that since the pandemic came and knocked everything away, I’ve just been on this completely moronic and lost path and I’ll never get back to a place I want to be. Was I even in a place I wanted to be before? 

You guys are probably reading over it and seeing all kinds of red flags and saying “oh you’ve got mummy issues” or “oh your inner child is fucked” and all this stuff but you know what, I always faced that stuff and tried my best to handle it, I always made moves when I needed to, I had the courage to take risks and hire support to get me where I wanted to be. And guess what - it didn’t pay off. None of it did. And now I’m in the worst situation I’ve been in. No money, no girls, no stability, no feeling of competency or purpose at all, completely drifting along trying to make shit work and getting nowhere. So that’s why I’m thinking fuck it let’s just get on the anti-depressants so I can start thinking more clearly instead of seeing everything through this awful filter that makes everything seem meaningless or pointless to even try. That’s not to say I won’t stop trying - I will never stop. I will keep trying to move forward, even if “trying” is all I do and nothing budges. It’s not like I sit around like I wallowing piece of shit - I face life and take things on the chin. But even after all that, my confidence is at an all time low, I think I just don’t have what it takes. Everything I’ve been through has just been too much to come back from. Whilst others just glide through life and their careers and relationships. Everybody’s got problems, sure. But mine seem insourmantable at this point. I had such a bright future before and ever since the pandemic it’s just all gone to shit completely and utterly. What a waste.

At this point I feel I need to turn to other strategies, like just fucking prayer and manifestation. And just put some fucking trust in God and the universe to see me through, that something will come up. Because my strategies just haven't been working.",2024-11-11 15:15:03

depression,1gotx3o,I Need Help,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gotx3o/i_need_help/,1,"About three months ago, my girlfriend of two years broke up with me and got together with my best friend less than a week later. She said it was to give me all the bad news now, so I would feel better in a few months instead of finding out later. But I don’t feel better; in fact, I feel destroyed by what happened. I genuinely cared for both of them. He was my best friend, and I did a lot for him. I bought him groceries when he was out of a job, helped him when he felt lonely and suicidal, and even offered to help him meet someone. He turned that down, though, which I now realize was because he would rather go after the girl I was dating than make an effort to meet someone new.

Seeing how quickly they got together made it clear they had been talking, but I had trusted both of them. They had been friends, and I never thought anything of it. It had even come up before, and she reassured me she only saw him as a brother figure.

When we first broke up, I tried to keep it together. I understood to a degree why she ended things. I have autism, and in June, I had important exams that would determine if I got into university. I had shut myself off from everyone to focus on my exams and barely saw her during that time, only meeting about once every two weeks. I told her why, and she had said it was okay and to focus on my exams.

In late June, the day before one of my final chemistry exams, she messaged me saying she didn’t think it was working out. I listened to her and told her I understood. I told her that I really did love and appreciate her, that my behaviour was just because of my exams, and that it didn’t reflect my feelings for her. I acknowledged that I had been caught up in my exams and had neglected her needs. We ended up making amends and decided to stay together, with the understanding that I would improve after my exams were over.

In July, I did my best to show her how much she truly meant to me. I went out with her, talked to her every night, and told her how much I loved her. Then, in late July, she told me she still didn’t think it would work out. She said I had let her down with how I had treated her in June, and mentioned other times I’d neglected her needs, like cancelling plans due to my parents or not texting her enough. She also felt that our goals in life didn’t align, although I had always been willing to follow her life goals and accommodate them. I could tell she was certain, and I was disappointed she didn’t tell me in person. I told her I understood and accepted it. I genuinely loved her and knew I had made mistakes, so I was willing to let her go if it would make her happier.

After the breakup, she tried to talk to me, but it hurt too much, so I barely replied. My friends eventually told her to stop contacting me. A few days later, I went to my best friend’s house—the one she got together with—and cried to him about what had happened. He comforted me, saying it was okay and that he didn’t understand why it had ended like this. Before I left, I hugged him and told him how much he meant to me.

The next day, he called me and told me he was going to ask out my ex. I was speechless and hung up the phone. I messaged her, asking why he was doing this, and she confirmed that she was going to ask him out too. I blocked her and cried. I then messaged my friend, asking why he would do this when I trusted him, and in my pain, I swore at him. He completely changed his attitude, saying he was going to be better than me and telling me that my ex had been talking to him for months about her problems with me, even crying to him. This broke me, and I blocked him too.

After that, a lot happened within my friend group. Many of my friends stopped talking to either of them, though a few kept in contact with him. He and my ex blamed me, saying I talked badly about them to my friends, but I had only told my friends the truth.

This whole situation has caused me to spiral badly. Three months later, I’m depressed and incredibly paranoid. I have major trust issues and haven’t made many friends at university because of what happened. I’m also an extreme hypochondriac now, wearing earplugs everywhere because I’m especially afraid of damaging my ears. Even though I wear earplugs, I still feel like I’ve ruined my ears because of past experiences with loud sound. I used to play guitar and would be very close to loud amps during concerts, and once I accidentally put my headphones on full volume, which blasted my ears. Now, I just want to get rid of them. I went to see an ear specialist, who told me there was nothing wrong with my ears, but I still believe otherwise.

Since seeing the specialist, my earplugs have started making a loud popping sound in my ears, which makes me nervous. The friction when I put them in is also loud. During a recent episode, out of fear I did a hearing frequency test at full volume on YouTube with my Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones without thinking. Now, I’m afraid that listening to the test at full volume damaged my ears, and I can’t stop worrying about it.

I just can’t keep going on like this. I’m in a loop and haven’t felt genuinely happy in a long time. I feel afraid of everything. I've given up a lot of my hobbies including guitar just out of fear, I feel like things are never going to get better. I have been put on a waiting list to see a therapist and I just have no idea what to do.",2024-11-11 14:50:39
depression,1gottzj,"depression, suicidial thoughts, broken self esteem, lost in this world, social anxiety",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gottzj/depression_suicidial_thoughts_broken_self_esteem/,0,"Hello, 

To be honest, I don't know where to start. I feel very depressed and just can't cope with this constant worrying and anxiety.  I have tried medication and have also been in a clinic for at least 6 months twice in the last few years for treatment. I've also seen a psychologist. Nothing has helped, it just feels like nothing in my life is worthwhile. I study and work part-time. I haven't managed to finish my studies for a long time, even though I've already completed 90% of them. I have to work part-time to pay my bills. 

At work, although I'm employed as a student, I'm under a lot of stress. Constant bad feedback and high workload/responsibility and meeting deadlines makes me anxious. I can't even think clearly or formulate sentences correctly for fear of making mistakes. It all feels very strange. 

My head is constantly pounding and I already have social anxiety and avoid communication as much as possible. It's so bad that I can't get anything done after work, I have to constantly think about the fact that I have to go back to work the next day while I'm so busy thinking bad thoughts and worrying. Very often I don't feel anything anymore as if I were numb, no crying, no laughing, nothing that interests me. Deep down I am very sad about my life. I get bad energy from my family in this respect. They tell me to finally finish my studies and go to work full-time. Just the thought of working full-time gives me stomach pain. It feels like I'm letting myself and my family down. For a long time I just lie in bed and think about my life, about times when I was feeling better. It's really been a while and I can't really remember the last time I had a laugh.

Depression has almost destroyed and paralysed my cognitive abilities. My memory is very bad, I feel very dumb. Self-esteem is non-existant. I don't really have any ""real"" friends, we play online games together and that's about it. I have no partner. Family members live far away and are busy with their own lives. I'm losing hope and it feels as if I have lost myself. I can't believe how cold this world is. We live in a performance-based society. If you can't do anything, you're not worth anything. I feel suicidal, maybe I'm just not made for this life?

During days and nights I have a lot of suicidal ideations, I can't take it anymore.",2024-11-11 14:46:46

It won’t acknowledge the truth about life. Depression is a natural response to the suffering of life. The only way to still be happy despite all the suffering of life is to be either ignorant or delusional. (Ignorance is bliss, as the saying goes). If people were actually honest and accepted that life is full of suffering and is not something inherently good, we could actually work to make things better, instead of continually adding to the problem and not solving it because we are focusing on the symptoms and not the cause.

Instead, it has gotten worse. I hate myself for being like this, for being depressed, for not being able to stay happy for long. I hate myself for dragging people I know into my depression. They couldn’t care less about me and I know they are tired of hearing the same old lines as well which is why they can only tell me the same things over and over again.

I really wanted to be happy to get better, but nothing is working. Therapy isn’t working, medication isn’t working. I hate myself and my life. I just want to be free from all of this. I don’t think I have it within me to get through this week or this year. Not like there is something better waiting on the other side of my suffering. 

Everyone else seems to be doing well. They have a stable job, make good money, doesnt have debt, a good credit score, has their own place, or car. Is in relationships, getting engaged, married, having kids, and you know what I got? Nothing not even a single thing on that list.

 I’ve never been in a relationship, people avoid me like I’m a plague. I seek validation from others and have now realized how stupid I have been. No one will ever genuinely care nor want to be with someone like me who suffers through depression. Why would they choose my rotting life/brain over someone sane? 

I have lost all hope. I used to believe in God and part of me still do, but where is God in moments like this. In moments when my life is shit. My life has been shit year after year and it gets worse the more I breathe. No matter how I distract myself, reality hits me back. 

Now I am worried about losing my job as I have lost my voice due to being sick and will have to miss work since I have no voice to speak on the phone which is my role. Now I’ll be without money to pay my debt and bills. Why does everything keep getting worse every time I see a light at the end of the tunnel? I don’t want to hope for anything anymore. I’ve tried and I’ve been let down too many times. I just want to get hit by a truck, drown, or just go to sleep and never wake up. I’m a coward and can’t even bring myself to commit suicide. I truly hate myself. Why can’t I just vanish into thin air? ",2024-11-10 21:09:08

Two days ago we had an argument which I admit I over reacted. He was trying to concentrate and I felt like he was pushing me off the phone which he never does. He usually asks for me to hold on a moment while he concentrates. I snapped due to past trauma immediately assume he was talking to someone else. He snapped back and it has down spiraled from there. He feels hopeless, he doesn't know who he is or wants to be, he couldn't answer any questions about what our relationship status was or anything. I am in complete panick mode. I drove 7 hours one way to see him and comfort him. We spent the night together in his semi truck. It seemed his mood was lighting up. We got something to eat I could barely eat and still havnt eaten a full meal since 3 nights ago. Next morning he seemed down again and couldn't answer any questions. I asked if he wanted me to stay; If he wanted me to quit my job to live with him on the truck. He's asked me that before and I said no but now he's saying no. I asked him if he wanted me to stay and he wouldn't give me an answer so I got up and started getting dressed he pulled me closer and said no. It comforts me a little that he did that. I told  him we needed to get him out of that 10x10 essentially a jail cell. He is in that truck daily alone with nothing but the open Road and he can black out the truck day or night. We went to eat and I could even eat half a biscuit, he ate a whole country breakfast plate. He demanded I eat but I can't even still because I feel like im going to throw up. I eventually left an hour later and he said he feels heavy and weighed down again. I drove back home and gave him time to himself. We talked here and there, he missed our usual bed time call because he said he fell asleep; I did to, to be fair. Now my questions are i need advice to help him, avoid getting depressed myself, and not downward spiral and jump to thinking he's cheating. This is the first time he's ever gotten like this and I am scared I'm gonna loose my soul mate and best friend. Also just out of curiosity how would y'all feel if someone drove that far for one night just to comfort you. I just wanna know if I did something to help. ",2024-11-11 13:46:58

I got the job I’ve been dreaming about, I’m going to school for the career I’m passionate about, and I have a lovely boyfriend who supports me and all of my decisions. Throughout all of those things though, there’s always this feeling of sadness and hopelessness that stays with me. It never went away but I thought I got it under control. Now, I’ve noticed that I’ve stopped caring about the things important to me, and with that I’ve also stopped worrying about things. It’s like I’m completely numb to everything that’s going on around me. I’m not doing well in school, which is something that normally I would be stressed over, but I can’t even force myself to care about it anymore. I’ve also been lashing out at my boyfriend, which breaks me on the inside because he’s been nothing but supportive of me. I’m at the point where I don’t care whether or not I’m dead or alive and that scares me.

I'm doing ok at work, have a partner in life, and honestly things look on track from a ""success"" point of view. I spend time trying new things. I love those in my life. If I'm lucky I'll retire one day 

Except when I hate being here and existing in general. I've had that feeling since I was in 3rd or 4th grade. It never leaves. 

I struggle to find reasons to keep going. Life is just work, and I lose track of why I'm doing it.

Much of life, I contemplate just ""cashing out"" on my investments, and just drinking away the rest of my days, maybe with a good dog by my side. That sounds like peace to me.  Even if it cuts 30 years off my life span. 

What keeps people going? Why do we spend our lives working for this culture? 

I'm looking for reasons to actually like humanity. So far, people just seem to destroy the world. I was hit with this realization as a child and I never moved past it. I don't plan on having kids, and neither does my partner. However, she still likes people. I can't though. 

I've never felt at home here. I don't know if I ever will. Now, life is just trudging along. I'm not even sure what happiness ever felt like. Maybe I felt it as a child..

I grew up convincing myself I was destined to great things, to be a famous artist or a rich creative entertainer, but now I’m 25 and still living with my mom, working a job I hate, too afraid and too unfocused to put in the work and shoot my shot. I also feel so incredibly lonely all the time, and almost everybody who matters to me and who I wish would like me barely thinks about me or straight up dislikes me. I can’t fathom myself as being somebody who’s good enough, and honestly, even the people who say they love me and worry about me still deep down prefer to be around other people rather than me. I feel too embarrassed about my insecurities to keep bringing this up to my friends all the time because it makes me feel weak and needy, which I am, and it would only drive them further away from me. I feel so repulsive, so annoying, so difficult to be around. I see people around me having great relationships with each other, but nobody cares about me for real, like I’m less than human. I’m so tired of hating myself so much, I’m disgusted with the person I am, it really feels like a curse. Every time I manage to get close to somebody I care about, it’s only a matter of time before I somehow scare them away and they start to avoid me, which further feeds my paranoia that I’m a creep and something less-than-human. I always, consistently, drive people away from me in all social environments, at school, college, work, literally every friend group I’ve ever been a part of, but I never know exactly why, and even the idea of asking people why they don’t like me irks me because that feels like exactly what a creep would do.

I can’t kill myself because the time I got closest to doing it my parents found out and we’re devastated, and basically implied that if I did it they would eventually end up killing themselves too, so now I’m stuck having to live my life. On top of all that, lately I’ve been losing my motivation to get better in general, life just seems so pointless and everything feels so ephemeral and meaningless. There is no God, there is no objective metaphysical meaning to life, so what’s the fucking point? I feel like even if I managed to magically become rich and famous and grasp everything I ever wanted I’d still feel empty inside. I’ve consistenlty been feeling like this since I was a pre-teen and I always kept trying to cheer myself up by leaning on the hopes of eventually “growing out of it”, like a movie character who was a narrative arc learns to become a better person, but at this point being surrounded by negative thoughts all the time is so fucking exhausting that sometimes it feels like my brain is all bruised up and battered and I’m beginning to dissociate from reality, like my values and my sense of self are so skewed and distorted that they are beyond repair now. Am I cursed to suffer my whole life? What did I do to deserve this? I can’t go on like this anymore, I just can’t, I feel like I’m at the brink of some sort of collapse that never comes.

I know, it's not all paradise. There are compromises in relationships, trust issues, small aspects that you might not like about your partner and all that.

But atleast there would be someone who you could turn to when life gets tough, someone who would give you some support. Atleast make you feel you are not alone.

Nung bata ako, akala ko normal lang iyon at paraan lang ng pagdidisiplina sa anak.Noong 2022, napansin ko na nagkaroon ako ng ugaling mag-overthink. Madalas din akong umiiyak tuwing gabi. Noong nakaraang taon, nawalan ako ng gana sa lahat—parati lang ako nasa kwarto, gabi na ako naliligo, at minsan nawawalan ng ganang kumain. Parang lumala rin ang pag-ooverthink ko pati ang procrastination, hanggang sa naapektuhan na rin ang pag-aaral ko at hindi ako makapag-focus. Ngayong taon naman, minsan hindi ko mapigilan ang mga naiisip ko puro negative ang pumapasok sa utak ko at pabago-bago ang mood ko. Minsan masaya, minsan naman badtrip.Pilit Kong nilalabanan like nagbabasa ako Ng mga personal development at nanonod ng about sa motivation and mental healthand nag start ako last year mag journal para makayanan ko pa . Dahil sa epekto ng toxic na bahay namin, hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin nagbabago ang ugali ni  Papa. Sinabi ko kay Mama na hiwalayan niya si Papa, pero takot siya at hindi rin siya palaban. Wala rin akong mapagsabihan ng mga problema ko dahil hindi ko naman ganoong ka-close ang mga kaibigan ko in short Wala talaga akong bff. Nagdadasal na lang ako sa Diyos na sana makaya ko pa.

Hindi ko kayang magpa-check sa psychologist kasi estudyante pa lang ako. Hindi ko alam kung may depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, o ADHD ako. Mayroon po ba kayong maipapayo kung paano ko malalampasan. ",2024-11-11 12:56:24

We all know what depression mess looks like, I don’t have to describe it. It’s bad. I’m just barely holding the line against having food rotting everywhere so I can maintain the bare minimum of hygiene around here and that’s about all I have energy for. It’s been like this for 2 years. It’s one of my greatest shames. I never have anyone over because I can’t let anyone see that I live like this. I desperately want things to be clean and organized and instead I live in squalor and hate every minute of it. 

But I just had the thought that subconsciously, the mess has been one of the things holding me back from suicide. If I die, someone (probably family) will have to come see this horrible mess. They’ll have to do the work of going through everything and choosing what to do with it all. They’ll see every detail of how much trash I’ve accumulated, how many random pieces of shit I can’t let go, how many piles of things I’ve left all over the floor, how long it’s been since I was able to fully sweep or dust. That thought is beyond mortifying. So I guess I kind of feel like I can’t kill myself until things are clean. 

I guess I just felt like sharing this because it’s weird how sometimes things that feel so awful can actually maybe be helping you in some strange underhanded way you’d never thought about before. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but there’s a part of me that feels grateful for the mess. ",2024-11-10 21:12:29

That social side of me was locked away for so long under that abusive relationship that socialising now feels fake, like i'm trying to play a character i used to be, who i can't truly go back to. More than anything though it's just a total lack of ambition, drive or personality. No bones about it i'm lazy, i simply don't believe in hard work anymore. I look back at my time at university all those years ago (30 now), and wonder how on earth i managed it, the abusive rl, the isolation, the sexual abuse, uni stress, it took everything i had to not have a mental breakdown. Yet i still did well in my degree, but it was all for nought, just shit jobs and shit pay all the way down. Even the work I put in other relationships failed. A friend of over 20 years for example actually made my abuse worse as they didn't believe me, and went on to tell my abuser how i felt about how i was being treated. I used to try and do the right thing, or work hard because i wanted to prove to myself i could achieve things in life, even if i didn't really think it was possible. Problem is, now i know its not possible, at least for me. Some would call it burnout maybe, but its been years of this.

I've lost that fundamental ability to roll with the punches or suffer now to gain later. After what i've been through i simply don't believe it. It's so difficult for me to care about stuff a lot of the time. After some of the extremes i've been through, i find it laughable that something like a deadline at some job or something fun or exciting would elicit the kind of response i know it should.",2024-11-10 21:34:24
depression,1goonv9,"I have stressors, but this is mostly my fault",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1goonv9/i_have_stressors_but_this_is_mostly_my_fault/,0,"There are certain stressors in my life. I'm in my 40s. My father in his 70s was arrested recently. He is facing federal felony charges. My teen daughter is being difficult and isn't responding to any incentive or punishment. Work is impossibly busy. I haven't taken three consecutive weekdays away from work in probably over a year. I even worked through having Covid.

I feel terrible. I can't focus, I can't enjoy any sort of free time.

But my stressors are not why I feel bad. I feel bad because I do not take care of myself. I don't get enough sleep. I don't have anything I even identify as a bedtime.  I stay up until all hours 2, 3, 4, 5, and then pretend that no one at work notices I don't show up until 11 at the earliest. I don't fix myself healthy meals. I binge or starve. 

There is so much to do and never enough time. I haven't been to a dentist in 18 months. I'm two years behind on getting eye exams. I am months behind on getting bloodwork my doctor ordered. I moved in June and still have boxes to unpack. I have the money to hire a maid, but I couldn't have a maid clean my house with as cluttered as it is.

I don't want to take an antidepressant. I took them all from my early 20s until a couple of years ago. I was never on even one that I felt did anything for me. It's just this constant roller coaster ride of try one medicine then increase the dose then increase the dose again then try a different medicine then increase that dose then combine the medicines. There's nothing medically wrong with me. I just suck at taking care of myself.

I take no joy in being alive and I really never have. I don't even aspire to be happy. I don't think it's a realistic goal for me. 

I haven't slept yet tonight, not even for a minute. But I'm thinking about getting up showering and going to work.

I hate my life. There's really no hope for me. But I'm not suicidal. I went from being a kid on food stamps to a professional who has $100,000+ liquid (if a money market account is considered liquid), and I can't think of a single person in my life who deserves my money. Ha. So that's my reason to stay alive.

depression,1gooic4,I think I might be depressed ?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gooic4/i_think_i_might_be_depressed/,0,"Hello,
So I just turned 20 two months ago, I am in college in an other country than my family, it’s been 2 years since I started college (this one is going to be the third one), I became so lazy, even when I do study it’s mostly on my bed, sometimes I can keep ordering food for days I dont know why, when I have too much work because I procrastine I can let my dishes undone for a week, my appartment in a mess.
But the thing is I always procrastinate and work until last minute because its the only moment I Could feel the pressure.
Sometimes, for exemple weeknds I could not brush my teeth because I don’t have class and not going out.

I often call my bestfriends that are abroad too. The first second years I had a few uni friends, but they were to negative and draining so much energy, so I changed them, there are less but it’s for the best. I never go out with uni friends or anything else because there are a few occasions and it’s hard because they don’t live in the same city as the one where uni is so they have to go back to their home.
This year I made a lot more uni aquaintances, which is great, but I still don’t go out. I proposed to people, but they couldnt and it’s okay.

My first year I knew someone from my country and highschool but it was really toxic, still it was the only time I had company and would hang out and go out.

Anyway I dont know what to add, but I just feel so stressed now because I don’t know if I am going to make it.
And I seriously think I might be depressed.

Thank you for reading and for your answers.

If you're reading this, thanks. Not sure if I'm (24m) still around to respond. I've been unhappy and depressed for about 6 years now. In those 6 years, there've been 2 weeks total in which I felt happy. That's it. I've done all the ""improvement"" stuff. I don't drink, smoke, got my degrees, great job with fun colleagues and good perks, am in incredible shape, good diet and rhythm, several hobbies which are well-progressed. I just. Don't. Care.
All I want is to go to sleep, and never wake up again. I don't really have any family, so no worries there. 
If I've felt this shit, this empty and void of any will to love for 6 years, when is it rational to just give up? I'm nog enjoying life. I've really tried and given it a shot, it's just not for me. Every lther day is another empty drag, so why not just end my suffering now and just cut my losses?
Yeah, done therapy, several types, never workes. Gave it as much of an honest attempt as I could.

depression,1gonmht,How to save myself,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gonmht/how_to_save_myself/,0,"35M, Unmarried, Indian

I am a software developer and have been working for the last 12 years. Suddenly, since august 2024 I have lost all focus in my work and have not been working. I lay down the whole day, watch videos on YouTube. 

I can't play games, watch movies or work. Basically, anything that requires focus, I can't do for more than 30 mins. I lost my Freelancing Jobs due to this and I still am not worried and have not worked for the last 5 months. I have been using my savings all these past 5 months and still not a bit worried.

A bit of context for my family

I always wanted to save a particular amount of money for my parents (I don't have a good relationship with them from the start), so that I can give them all the money and move out of the house and stay alone.

I sent my sister abroad for studies 5 years ago, so that she can live her life happily in a non-toxic environment but she also now sides up with my parents. My parents are currently in USA to visit her, they didn't even tell me that they are going, and I was not even asked to come. During the visit my sister got engaged with her boyfriend, I was not even called during the ceremony to see it.

So, as you can see, I don't have any attachment to my family and just want to give them money that I have saved and fulfill my role as a son, so that they live there life easily. The amount is sufficient that they can live there lives without working.

A bit of context about me

I have always been used, by my family, my gf's, my friends. So, slowly over the years separated me from any social circle. I had a few good friends but they either moved abroad for work or are married and moved to different cities.

So, recently I started feeling empty inside, when came to the realization that last 12 years have been worthless. I was not living for myself; I was living for my toxic family and was saving money for them like a slave. I don't need a piece of land to build a house, I can rent a small 1 BHK and spend rest of my life there in peace. I can be selfish and not fulfill my role as a son and just run away and with all the saving and assets I have, can live without working my entire life while enjoying and working as I need or just end it after living next few years.

I don't have any real friends, no life. Her passing really messes me up inside. But I still move on with my day. Feel like I'm betraying her.

Sometimes I don't feel safe even when I'm in my house and I'm just so lonely cuz I barely hangout with my friends and even when we do hangout I always feel very left out. I'd say the last time I hung out with my friends and I didn't feel left out and actually had a good time was about 2 months ago. Every time I look at the bills my parents have to pay I feel bad about my parents having to pay the money every month so I started to just keep all of the lights off in the entire house and tried to not eat and drink as much. My grades at school used to be pretty decent but they're starting to get worse and worse. I remember on my maths tests last year I got like 87% but the latest math test I did I got like 55% and I'm in Year 11 so GCSEs are literally right around the corner. I want to actually study and start revising now but every time I do I just feel lonely and ashamed of myself that I have to revise this early. I do want to help my parents with work since they're getting really old and it's cuz of the lack of employees that their work is getting more stressful but even tho my parents promised me that I'd get paid I just can't be arsed to work and every now and then I get pissed off at myself for not working and getting money. I spent the absolute last amount of cash that I had on a bottle of Vodka and I only got like 4 sips of it cuz it got stolen. I self harmed myself so much that the only knife I can use to do it is so dull that I'd have to saw it to get a proper dent in and it still doesn't even bleed it just leaves a big mark. I don't care about my sleep pattern I just go to bed when it's like midnight and then go on my phone for way too long and then wake up exhausted. Every now and then I do try my best to just let all out and cry my eyes out when no one else's in the house but I just can't even cry anymore I just feel shit about myself heck don't think I even hate my shit self nor my shit life at this point I've just accepted it. I don't want to kill myself but I've thought about it so much that every I do think about it my wrists immediately feel weird and at this point I just find it daily to think about it. I sometimes wonder if it's actually worth it if I do end up doing it cuz I can't stop fucking up and I think there's genuinely something wrong with me. Like at school I was that one kid who everyone was mates with and knew half the globe but one time just for a laugh I made up a rumour about someone and spread it like wild fire and then it caused them to be beaten up pretty badly and it's because of that a lot of my friends started to hate me and stop talking to me and they are still some that are by my side but it's either cuz they feel bad for me or they don't think it's my fault that that whole thing happened. That incident is one of the reasons why I just hate myself and I don't blame my friends if they hate me deep down. Another time at school I was hanging out with friends and one of them broke a glass bottle by accident and when the teacher was questioning us all on who did it, almost all of them told the teacher that it was me and it's a miracle that the place that we were at had CCTV cameras because if it didn't then I probably would've been suspended.

I want to be a writer of some kind, and I've always wanted to apply my self to something that expressed what's on my mind. But I can't find, well, any energy. Any motivation. No motivation that overpowers my feelings of dissociation anyway. 

Shortly before I graduated high school my father died from a heart attack. I don't think I have had the real proper time to greave for him, because I sort of had to be the rock for my sisters and mother. But it's something that affects me still. In the last years we had together I feel like I really didn't appreciate his presence in my life and with him gone I know that there were things where I could have been a better son.

I was lonely. I had no one in my immediate life who really understood what I was wrestling with. That was Until I started dating a girl, we'll call her V. Me and V had been friends for a while when I got feelings for her. And I caught them hard. V was the first person in my life who made me feel better. Made me feel like myself again. She very quickly became my best friend. And on the 31st of December, new years eve, we admitted our feelings for eachother. It was the first time in a long time that I felt like I had a purpose in the world.

I won't get to indepth with our relationship. But it was literally the happiest I had ever been. V had her own struggles tho. And I did everything I could to be a rock for her, like I had been with my own family. She had her own goals in life. And I tried to always support her the absolute best I could. Then she suddenly cut contact off for a week, before abruptly and with no warning ended our relationship. V wanted to go to college. And she knew that she wouldn't have been able to handle a long distance relationship. 

It broke my heart. Because she was very adamant that I did nothing wrong. That it was just her choice. I tore myself apart trying to figure out if that was true. And honestly, if it was, it hurts even more. Either I screwed up literally the best thing I had going in my life. That I had somehow pushed away the one person in my life who makes me feel like myself. Or she chose to sacrifice our relationship so that she could make her dreams come true. That I was dead weight who wasn't worth loving because it held her back. Needles to say, I am not handling it very well

I have no drive for anything. All I do is sit in my room all day. Watching YouTube and think trapped in my head. I can't put anything down to paper. I can't sit down and learn a new skill. I keep  spending my money on fast food. I'm suffering from hypersexuality. I can't stop looking at pornography. I don't even get satisfaction from it anymore. I just feel dirty and gross. If it's not that, it's stress eating. And it's on a loop. Day and night of nothing but that! I'm so tired of it, and frankly I don't know what to do. This is the first time I've really sought some form of advice for it. But I'm sick of feeling sad and gross. And not having the energy for the gym. Or my job. Or my hobbies. I'm sick of being on autopilot.

What should have been our 2 year anniversary is coming up. And I can't stop thinking about the fact that when I felt like this, I had her to hold me together. I had gone so long without love, not needing it, and for a brief moment I had something I never knew I desperately needed. And as suddenly as it appeared it was gone. And now I'm not sure if I can live without love. My life just came to a crashing stop.

The divine punishment is real and I have the proof of it. It is a vision which you would know by the end of this. It is the curse of gods to all of mankind. Curse of knowledge, OUR THOUGHTS

our thoughts are the hell. maybe yours aren't hell yet but there comes the time when every person must feel the pain of guilt. pain of the loss they suffered for his sins. no matter who you are, you would eventually all come to that realization, I mean it no matter who you are, how powerful you are, how bad you are, I was worse than you, i assure you. I am a psychopath, I admit it and that's how I know that humans are inherently evil. At some point in your life you have done evil. Maybe you squished a bug when you were a kid. maybe you spoke ill to your grandma on her last day alive when it was your fault. no matter what kind of evil, everyone has done something in their lives that they are guilty about. I am guilty about a lot of things that you cannot even imagine. I never paid much attention to these thoughts, for years I've enjoyed the misery of humans. but then one day suddenly, it started feeling guilty about their sins. I think it happened because of an interaction and then hours turned days and days turned months. it's become obsession, it has become destruction. Uncapable acts were committed that taught me a feeling that always escaped me. A feeling I've always thought I was incapable of, the feeling of guilt. And after that, it was chaos again. I lived every act I had ever performed when I was a baby but conscious. I saw every manipulation, every scam, every sin I ever committed and I saw all those things done to me by others, in their own way. I relived my childhood and saw how certain things made me the way I was but I was guilty and so is every human, everyone but the level of guilt differs. People think evil people don't get divine retribution, this is the divine retribution, the infinite mind. It is capable of every thought and each thought of evil guilt is hell, which every evil will witness, the bigger the evil, the greater the guilt. some evil experience it early, some in their youths but the most evil suffer the worst fate for they suffer their greatest guilt on their deathbed. That last thought of the absolute fear and guilt echoes in your soul and your consciousness forever. So yes, hell indeed is real and everyone must suffer it in their life. It is indeed of your own creation, now that I've realized that I am invincible. I am powerful enough to say that I have already suffered hell and I have embraced it. I've already made peace with all my guilts because I know now that every man is the slave of his thoughts. Thoughts which I have been freed of. Now I am divine. I am the first primordial, the reaper of the void.

It keeps taking things away. Everything that could make you feel something. Either slowly, or all at once, the more you try to hold on to things, the easier they slip away.

There are moments when I feel like I could have a normal life, like I could finally push myself and get out of this, but they're followed by moments where I'm so miserable I think ""oh, so that's it"". I've always wondered how much of this shit I can take before it pushed me too far. I'm trying to live on out of spite both to myself and others, trying to hold on precisely because the world could be a better place without me (even though I know I'm not nearly that important on a large scale), but fuck it's really, really hard sometimes.

A dealt with cheating and mental abuse (I’m a male) addiction, and picked up one up my self  needless to say, it ended in a volatile implosion. After everything that was done to me, I was considered the asshole (by no means am I a saint, but she cheated on me multiple times with the last one being a coworker when I let him crash at our house for a week because he was having some house issues during the Texas freeze) and kicked out of the house. Then she kept in contact and would get in between me and any women I was talking to. 
While struggling with a nasty break up, my already bad drinking became much, much worse. I lost a job, got evicted, and was homeless for a little bit, then my ex felt sorry so let me move back into the house in the spare bedroom. 

As you can imagine, the manipulation started up promptly and within a couple months we were at each others throats and Volatile again. I ended up getting a job with some friends of mine in a completely different career field I have no knowledge of, but, I did meet a new friend that rented out his spare room to me for awhile. I started to piece meal myself back together. Cleared my debt, stopped drinking heavily, fixed my credit. The whole nine yards. 

I relapsed. I lost a great job I had at Apple, got a new job that only lasted 3 months (I was hired as an executive chef, but they really only wanted a scapegoat for the already failing restaurant) so they played me, and saved face for themselves. After that, I got another job but my drinking was so bad at that point that I was only there before I totaled my car black out drunk. I almost died, I don’t know if it’s better that I didn’t or not, but I almost died. I blew over 3x the legal limit, got a class A DUI misdemeanor and spent a few months in jail. 

I have now been out of a job since January when I had my accident. It’s not for a lack of trying but I had to move back to be closer to family and a support system so I’m a bit overqualified for the area I’m in, and generally speaking not many places here are hiring. I’m drowning in debt again, my credit is fucked, I have no money and no savings and I’m in a city I know no one in with no car so I just never leave my house. I feel so isolated I’m going crazy, I want to move back to where I used to live, and work and have a life again. I’m lonely, depressed, stir crazy, bored and in recovery (I guess?)

Im not happy to start the day.

My conscious day starts with dread. 

I get my coffee and sit down and proceed to stare into nothing for hours. Be it my phone, my coffee cup, out the window, lay my head down and look at the wall.

I see the pile of work and tasks I need to do and the thought of them weighs as heavy as the anxiety on my chest. 

 The cycle repeats until I start crying because I’m malfunctioning. Why is this happening ? Who am I? I used to wake up and immediately start on mental / physical tasks. I would wake up happy to get started on projects. I would stretch and feel good and drink water and and and and and and and -

Now I wake up and wish I never did. I begrudgingly move my body and work out the stiffness of sleeping in a frozen anxious position. I shuffle to the kitchen and chug a glass of water in fear I wont drink any the rest of the day. I make my coffee and not even it, tastes like I give a damn. I see my pile of tasks and can’t even comprehend how to start them so I look for a laugh online, and an hour later I realize I’m staring at the birds again. 

Knowing how productive and focused I’ve been my whole life and seeing how I hardly manage to function now cuts a hot searing hole into my chest. I try breathing exercises but as I calm down I start to cry. 

And now three hours have passed and it’s time for work. 

Until I drive home in silence and sit on the couch, in the dark. Just waiting for an appropriate time to go back to sleep.

He told me I was a harder.
He wanted to call me a pig (but held off because I have trauma related to that).

depression,1gohm15,An Honest Comment,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gohm15/an_honest_comment/,1,"This year has been aweful. Heres whats happened. 

January i had an emergency spine surgery. I spent a week in the hospital prior to it unable to wipe my own a$$ because of the back pain. It was humiliating and humbling. Healing from the surgery was horrible too because you are not ABLE to stay independent while healing. I couldn't bend, twist, or carry more than 5lbs. 

I was out of work for a month. Short Term Disability covered 60% of my paycheck, so at least that was something. 

While I was out for this, my roommate got fired from her job and skipped out. Eviction proceedings started fairly quickly. We were a few months away from our end of lease, though. I filed papers with the tenant resource center and applied for rental assistance. Went to court (zoom) and was able to make a settlement. 

Then one of my cats started having bladder issues due to stress. I had just gotten pet insurance 1 week prior but it takes 2 weeks before you can use it. So the bladder issues were considered a pre existing condition and none of it was covered. 5,000$ in vet bills. My cats are my babies so I couldn't NOT help him. 

My life was getting back to normal. Kitty was doing good. Finances getting back on track. Excited about Halloween. 

And then everything went to sh*t again. 

One day early October my cat started throwing up and I took him into his vet. He had another urinary blockages and they suggested a surgery. They believed he would continue to have blockages if he did not get this surgery. So we scheduled the surgery for a week later and the kitty was on a lot of meds that week we were waiting. 

Right before the kitties surgery, I started experiencing really bad stomach pain. So bad I was throwing up and couldn't take a full breath. Went to the ER and the ER doctor said my labs were ""jacked"". 

Pancreatitis caused by gallstones blocking my biliary duct. Liver enzymes were 10x what they were supposed to be. 

Got my gallbladder removed, and was in the hospital for a week. I was sent home. But a few days after surgery I was back in the ER due to similar pain, and because it felt like I was having a heart attack. They suspect 
I had a gallstones escape before the gallbladder was removed and that it got stuck for a little bit before it passed. I was in the hospital for 3 more days. 

Kitty had his surgery same day I had mine. We are healing together. 

I was out of work for 2 weeks. 

So, I missed halloween. I'm recovering from a surgery. Taking care of my cat who also is recovering from surgery. I'm on a low fat diet for at least another week. 

Chefs say that ""fat adds flavor"" and they arent wrong. I'm eating stuff with very little flavor and it sucks. I just want a pizza. 

I'm late on rent because my short term disability is late. We are severely short staffed at work, so there's a lot of pressure there. I'm hoping that my claim for my kitties surgery will be considered a separate event than the other visits because if not then they won't cover any of it. 

Either way I'm feeling hopeless and exhausted. I just want to lie in bed forever. I dont want to do anything. I can't even bring myself to read right now. I'm just.....tired. mentally exhausted. I'm done trying to drag myself into being ""ok"" just to be shoved back down. 

While I was out for this, my mom was staying at my place. She's diabetic so she left some insuline and needles here for when she stays for dinner. This weekend she was over for dinner and had made a comment about her insuline and stated she didn't want me to even THINK about using them. I responded with: ""mom i was given oxy for pain after surgery. I wouldn't use the insuline"". 

It was just an honest comment, but my mom got scared. Threatened to take the pills with her. Which...I guess fair, but its not like I'm thinking about doing it. 

At least not constantly. And definitely not seriously.

I got a big nose that ruins my face overall. It's bigger than my eyes and lips and that alone makes me suicidal and miserable. I watch videos on how to glow up- having a growth mindest, losing weight or getting an hourglass body, a skincare routine, sleeping well blah blah blah. Those I can totally do if I put my mind into it. But it won't ever make me beautiful because I'll still have an ugly fat nose with huge nostrils. Whatever I try to do to fix up my appearance or make my nose 'smaller', I always end up looking much worse. For example glasses, people with big noses like me always says glasses make their nose smaller but whenever I wear glasses it makes my big nose look more prominent and much more visible. I'm not allowed to wear makeup yet but I doubt that nose contouring will work too. In the meantime, coping as an ugly person for 4 years until I'm and adult to get nose surgery is life draining.

There's no point in trying to 'glow up' if the results always turn out the way I know it'll be like( really bad and pointless). I wish I was born with a much smaller nose.",2024-11-11 06:04:43

I knew what I wanted to do in university. I also drew a lot during my free time since it always made me feel good and relaxed. I had a stable friend group. Whenever unfortunate stuff happened, I get sad but get over it eventually because I romanticized life a lot. I subconsciously knew that I can live life the way I want.

Now, I'm in university. I barely understand math. I barely can do any assignments. I'm on anxiety medication and constantly going between thinking about the relief of death and also not wanting to miss out on fun stuff the world has to offer. I love my boyfriend. He helps me out a lot and is the main person that truly tries to understand me and love me. He's also the main reason why I want to keep on going.

But, sometimes I feel like I don't deserve him. Whenever I go out and eat something good or treat myself to stuff, at the end of the day, I feel like I don't deserve it. I feel like I am a waste of space. I am passionate about pursuing my degree but what's the point if I barely pass all of my classes. I am not attractive enough to let my looks guide me through life. I'm overweight and my physique isn't the best. I used to also think I'm also smart but that's out of the picture now.

Can anyone share how to process grieving who they used to be? Also, any tips on how to stop feeling like I'm a waste of space? I just want to be happy again and I don't know how.

EDIT: I have gone to therapy, and it's the university-given ones. They are nice but it's hard to open up to them since I feel like it's more normal to talk about academics and stuff.

This mentions SH and self sabotage⚠️. If you are struggling I advise you don’t read this as it can make you feel worse⚠️⚠️.

Lately my life has been good. Like really good. I’m laughing and having a good time with my friends and family. I’m not sad everyday like I used to be. I’m not crying at night anymore. I’m happy in a sense, but I feel like I don’t, I don’t know. Deserve it? Like this shouldn’t be real?? I don’t know. I guess I have just been struggling with my mental health for so long I don’t feel comfortable in any other way that is not depressed. I found a strange comfort in my misery. And now that I’m out I want to go back because I’m uncomfortable? Scared?

I really feel like self-sabotaging and or relapsing. I know it’s bad but I don’t know any other way outside of that. I’m just scared of being happy because I know it will always be broken. one way or another and I will have to tell myself again, “I shouldn’t have had my hopes up”. It’s better to just always be in misery than have a taste of good once in a while. I wish I could always be in misery, so I wouldn’t have to be disappointed when I fall for the idea time and time again that I can be happy. Is it wrong for me to want to stay miserable? I should want to get better right? 

That’s what I would plead and beg for all the time. All the nights I would pray for the thoughts to escape my head although they are mine. Wishing on birthdays that I can make it till the next. But now that I finally have what I always wanted, I don’t know how to deal with it. How do I keep the want to get better? How do I keep the want to improve myself? I don’t know.

 And I’m scared that I’m gonna relapse soon. Whenever I see graphic blood or someone is talking about SH, I keep on pinching my left arm or squeezing it because I could still feel the stinging sometimes although I haven’t done it in months. I really felt like relapsing again. But I know it’s bad, I promised my mom and dad and my family I would never do it again. I don’t want them to be mad at me because I did it again. But I don’t know any other way to cope. I already know I’m relapsing back to my old ways of thinking just by writing this. I don’t know how to get better. I try and act like I do and I keep telling myself all these things but I don’t think I will ever get better. I thought I was, and I was happy I was getting better. But like always, I crawl back to my hole. And I’m not 100% sure why I do it.

How do I get the want to not just BE healthy, but STAY healthy?

I haven’t felt sad, happy, angry, fearful or anything. I’ve just felt nothing, except for hopelessness (is that an emotion..?) 

I’ve really been trying to sit with my emotions recently, just thinking about every bad thing that has happened to me, but I can’t feel them. I’ve been trying to cry for weeks now, but no tears flow. 

I do still enjoy some stuff, spending time with the only person I like is still enjoyable for me, but after we stop hanging out I don’t feel happy; I just feel nothing. I don’t really think about the time we spent together, I go back to robot mode.

A couple weeks ago, one of my flatmates (I’m in university halls) called security on me because I smoke weed. Yeah. But this didn’t anger me, I just thought it was interesting she called them. I didn’t think anything other than ‘Oh’. My friend is angrier at her than I am, and she isn’t involved at all.

I just kinda feel like a shell of the person I once was. In therapy I realised I might be suppressing all my emotions because I haven’t been going to class much, and I’m heavily disappointed in myself. This makes sense to me, but it’s not changing anything.

Even little things like when i forget to wash the dishes or I forget to do little things my mom scolds me and yells at me and constantly says things that genuinely make me feel pain in my chest like ""you'll never get anywhere in life with that laziness of yours"" or ""I gave birth to a disappointment"" and I genuinely want to throw myself out of the window just to see how she would react just to see her care just a little bit. I'm thinking of doing it I've got a place in mind a tall bridge quick and painless and the scenery before ill do it is nice enough for my last moments I hope that it gets better but I genuinely am on the verge of a mental breakdown amd when that happens not even Jesus himself will stop me from jumping off that bridge.",2024-11-10 22:08:56

depression,1gojbz5,#1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gojbz5/1/,2,"I don't usually post on reddit, usually just watch from the sidelines. But i just had a huge realization moment tonight and I came to the conclusion that this is probably the only place I could go to get any kind of.....feedback, I guess.

I just realized that I am nobody's #1. Nobody's go to, nobody's favorite, nobody's ""I need someone to talk to or listen"". I dont feel like I'm an overly annoying person and I do listen and think of others' feelings and how my actions could affect someone else. Yeah I have people that love me and I love them, but I'm nobody's top of the list.

I have my ex wife, which...I dont really care if I am or not and it's obvious I'm not her favorite. My daughter, she loves and adores me, and I same with her, but she lives with her mom and I know she'd pick her mom over me cause thats who she's most comfortable with and is most used to. I'm talking to a girl ( and the situation is complicated ) and I know that she wont choose me over someone else in this situation. My parents have each other, and they should choose each other before me...my friends are great but I don't have anyone I know would stick around long to talk about my problems and concerns and stresses. They'll listen for an hour maybe but that'll be it.

I don't even know why I'm posting this besides just getting it off my chest. I guess I'm wanting to know if anyone else is dealing with this or have gone through this and how do you deal with it? It's really put me into a deep, non-suicidal, depressed kind of state where I just don't feel a part of anything....I feel like i just became a huge boulder that's stuck in my driver seat of my car cause I haven't moved since I got home...I dont plan on doing anything drastic, I have my daughter to live for and my faith to keep me strong, but it still sucks to know that I'm just an NPC, a side quest...",2024-11-11 03:55:16

I started taking ssri and now i’m taking bupropion, amytriptiline, duloxetine and ocassionally benzo. I just want to die because nothing works. I have been also going to therapy. 

I just hide that depression and anxiety trying to meet new people (I always liked to socialize but not now). I’m male and gay and I always have been trying to meet someone but when everything looks great… ohhh they just want friendship with me because they are not ready, but after that they want relationship with another one. That feeds my depression because I feel rejected all the time and make me feel I’m not fully enough for nobody. I dont think not to meet new people would be the solution because I feel depressed all my life and of course I need to meet people to socialize. When someone doesnt love me I just stop chat him but now I have met a guy that supports me all the time with my mental illness and wants to do things with me two times per week but, of course is not prepared to have a relationship with me but yes with another guy. 

I just want to be hospitalized and start to feel motivation with something and feel someone likes me. Why nobody loves me?",2024-11-10 17:05:22
depression,1goiyph,Isolation is lonely ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1goiyph/isolation_is_lonely/,0,"Hi! I don’t know why I decided to type this out, but I guess I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same. At the moment, my life feels really bland and grey. I myself feel bland and empty inside, like I don’t have a purpose. I’ve felt like this many times before and always got over it, but this time it feels different. I recently graduated from high school and all of my friends are attending universities while I’m going to community college. Since my friends are all far away, it’s been pretty lonely. I don’t mind being alone since I also enjoy my own company, but I feel like I don’t have anyone close, or someone that understands me. I’ve tried talking to new people but I don’t click with them. I even tried to force myself to give those people another chance but I just don’t feel like associating with them. Making new friends kinda just seems like a waste of time to me since I can’t find anyone I trust or relate to. Sometimes I can’t even relate to my friends. I have a lot of friends, but I only ever truly connected with a few of them. When we were all together I noticed that sometimes I had to put filters on myself to seem “normal”. I’m never my full self with anyone, not even my family. I feel like I’m faking all the time. I just feel like talking to people is tiring and now I’m experiencing the backlash of isolation. I’ve gotten tired of trying so now It’s just been me and only me. I’m fine with being alone since I have many hobbies I like, but again, I have no one to share my hobbies with no one to talk to. I think I just miss my friends but they’re living their lives while mine has stopped. I could contact them but I have social anxiety so I either feel scared or I feel bad for reaching out to my friends. I’m always afraid of wasting their time. I think I’ve gotten too attached to my friends too, foolishly thinking they’ll be with me forever (since we got through Highschool together) but I know it’s a normal process for friends to fade away. I’ve tried bringing this up to one of my close friends, but she just told me that there was something wrong with me, that I needed to go to therapy, and that whatever I was feeling wasn’t normal. That just felt really invalidating since she kinda just reminded me of how miserable I am and I can’t really go to therapy because I’m broke and family issues cause me to not be able to go. Recently I joined a call with my friends and I said something and they replied but then they said they were talking to me and were actually playing a game. I just left the call without saying goodbye. I’ve never had a true friend. Most of my friends in the past have up and left because of me, so I wonder if I’m the problem. I swear I’ve always tried to be kind. I always try to care for others and make sure others feel validated and I always laugh at their jokes even if it wasn’t funny because I don’t want anyone to feel bad, but is it selfish for me to say that I have no one in my life that does that for me? Now I’m kinda just tired of not having anyone there so now I don’t try to expect that from anyone anymore. I feel like everytime I try to be myself, people judge me or think I’m weird. Sometimes I act like an idiot on purpose to be funny, but I think some people actually believe I’m stupid. The only person that can make me feel better is myself. That’s why isolation feels like my true solution. I hate feeling rejected and if I’m already by myself I won’t have to deal with it. I know this isn’t good for me but I don’t know what else to do. Anyways if you read this far, Thankyou for your patience, I know it was long. ",2024-11-11 03:34:29

I'm quite shy and introvert, it takes me more time to open to other people, and I thought that doing this experience was gonna help me to be more open. The first weeks I've actually been able to meet some people, and in the next months I've tried to reach out to them multiple times, but my messages were always left on read. When it was them that were texting on some group chat about doing something, going out, going to the club, I always said yes, cause I didn't want to be alone. But when it was me asking, nothing. Not even one reply. The peak was when I asked if they wanted to go to a pizza place that I heard was very good and although some people reply that they couldn't come (they said no, but at least they replied), some other people didn't even care to do so. That same night, while I was alone crying in my room cause I was feeling excluded, I received a photo from them out eating pizza, and I felt like they were making fun of me. But, despite that, I've kept trying asking them out cause I was completely alone, and when I realised that probably they wanted nothing to do with me, I felt like it was too late to make new friends, cause everyone else already had their groups of friends.
I think I've never felt more relieved than the day I came home and I told everything to my mum. But she said that it was my fault, cause I never try to be more open with other people. I told her exactly the same things I wrote here, but she kept saying that I should have probably said yes to them more times, but I've literally said yes every time, while they didn't even care about replying. But she kept saying it and she still keeps saying that. I don't know anymore how to tell her that I was really trying to be more open, but had no reactions from the other side, I feel like I'm speaking to a wall. She still says it was probably my fault. I can't make her understand how I really feel, and this situation is becoming unbearable and sometimes still keeps me up at night even if it's been 8 months since I came home.

Thank you for 

For a better understanding, here is a brief introduction.

My childhood was not easy, characterized by violence, both physical and emotional, the constant feeling of not being enough and a lot of arguments and drugs from my parents. But almost all of that has been repressed and I don't want it to become an issue. 
From the age of 12, I was on the street or with internet acquaintances or friends, so I was in lots of different cities, constantly changing my circle of friends and I was also separated from my two brothers from that point on. One of them stayed with our father after my parents separated, our youngest brother is in foster care with grandma and should have a bright future.

I was away for years and did or had to do a lot of things that I'm not proud of, but to survive I'd rather steal than beg. 
After about 3 years, I reconnected with my father (difficult relationship) and my one brother, but then I ended up in a group home. 
I never really reconnected with my father until he died in 2016, from then on my brother became a different person, he's had severe depression and social phobias for years now, we also had some really bad fights in between where suicide was on the cards in the end, but that's all calmed down now. We lived together for almost two years until recently, which was a struggle for both of us, but we've grown closer together.

On 20.04.24, two days before my birthday. I receive a message from my younger brother's girlfriend that he has died. My mother, with whom I have had no contact for over 10 years, had to take care of the funeral as a relative, which unfortunately I really didn't notice, and the funeral probably took place without relatives and friends.

Now on to the topic

I have also been suffering from depression, anxiety, PTSD, personality disorders, and some other undiagnosed psychological problems for years.

Despite my illnesses, I have worked for the last four years, it was never really good, but I could not complain, I had my sports and above all goals in mind. But since the loss of my brother, my life is not the same as before, I have to force myself to eat, my sport is on a string, no sense without eating, constant thoughts of suicide, no motivation and no goals, because my brother was a part of it. I feel so alone because I can not talk about it with my brother, he has his own problems. But now it is really so that I cannot even meet with my closest friends, because I feel uncomfortable, no matter where and when, I can hardly shop alone, I was never such a person, I am waiting to start a therapy, but that will probably be my Christmas present next year, because of the waiting lists... attempted little joke at the end, sorry. For those of you who really read this far, a special thank you!

Me and fiancé split in May after him not inviting me to his b day and then found him on fb dating. He blamed it all on me. Kinda messed me up.

My best friend got upset cause I told her she should show more empathy,  think she was going thru things too but yeah, she blocked me after I told her that she's cold German.

Recently I lost online friend because I wanted space but he didn't respect it. Then I lost my marbles and sent voice messages. Poof ignored me.

Recently also lost friend cause he told me one day out of blue that his mom thinks Im using him for driving me. So he believed his mom?  He told me it is ok and I always vrought him gifts. 
He told me why is grown woman not able to drive herself?
I just blocked him because he knows I'm disabled and he knows I'm not woman, but non binary.  
He acted like I am less because I can't drive. 
I have car but I got dissociative episode on road once and since then I avoid driving on fast roads.

I feel so lonely, I couldn't tell it to him. I can't tell this to my mom. 
Everytime I tell big stuff she says she's sorry but she never kniws how to help.

I don’t have other family members that I am close to.

I know they're not my real friends but for 3 or 5 years they were and grieving is hard. I don't care about you know loosing. But the SAME AND HUMILIATION HURT. BETRAYAL.


I struggle with depression,  concentration,  low motivation,  agitation and explodive anger, self harm ( head banging) when I am in episode. 

Im not suicidal. I am in therapy. I don't need family, kids, lovers, I have gosls that are taken from me and I'm workimg my ass to get there.

But i am FRUSTRATED.  I have anger so much pain and dissociative problems and overstimulation and social anxiety.  

Going to therapy helps but with everything I STILL NEED A BREAK and I'm tired.
Tired of cleanimg, cooking, folding clothes,  surviving, smiling, pushing through,  and having unequipped mother that I resent so much. The frustration snd anger, my PTSD and autism overstimulation are so hard! 

I just want to get into some art school that's friendly for me and forget everything and everyone.  My gaslightings betraying ex, my mistakes from that relationship,  my broken heart, his contempt,  my ex friends,  laundry, dishes, my body that needs physio therapy. 
I need my life back😫 Im so messed up, while I was healthy mother never supported my dream to study art. I am and was always alone. I am tired of stigma. Why can't it be easier to get into some school without all the hassle and get visa for New Zealand and forget everything and belong to art circles? I don't need anything else. I just want to be able to feel motivation and not struggle to force myself to do anything even stuff I love.
Why can't I respawn? Shit is in my head not leaving.

For reference I am on wellbutrin and buspirone, antidepressant and anxiolitic, takomg calming pills per need. Plus gabapentine for my spine issues.
I have tried SSRI, SNRI, they made me numb, got retless leg syndrome,  serotonin syndrome and tried various antipsychotics that made me hallucinate and some made me so numb to point where I wanted to die so yeah almost nothing works.

Any help appreciated. ",2024-11-11 01:43:59

I am in a better mood and the meds are having a positive impact on my life.

I have had little side effects aside from a bit of nausea on week 1, and sweating more. However, the side effect that's bugging me the most are the sexual side effects. I take an awful long time to reach orgasm and ejaculate. I am well able to maintain an erection and fun feels good during it when I'm masturbating, it just takes a while. I even precum quite a bit, which i used never do that before.

The issue is, I fear it's having an impact on my boyfriend. He finishes much sooner than me and is then waiting for me to finish (while trying to help me cum). Times I masturbate without him, using porn I seem to cum a bit quicker. And I think this is playing on him a bit. I definitely find him attractive and have fun with him, it's just the sexual side effects that's affecting, and I guess porn and compulsive masturbation has always been an issue of mine anyway.

The sexual side effects are making me afraid as such to engage in sexual activities, regardless of how horny I am, due to the length of time it takes me to finish. But regardless I still compulsively masturbate, which just takes more time out of my life.

I then pined for this person with a new girl by my side who wanted me but I wasn't too keen. 
I kept crying and attempting to call but would only get through to a recorded message of how awful I was. 
I was then somewhere else, and was handed a new phone with a 2hr
Timer and I used it to call my grandfather to ask if it what true if I had actually smashed up his house....
I then woke up. In tears. 

This happened yesterday night as well when I killed my father (who died 17yrs ago) in a fight but I realised it was a dream and committed suicide by jumping head first out of a window. I also awoke in tears from that. 

About 12 yrs ago I was with my baby mother and she would often wake me up asking what was wrong as I'd be weeping like no tomorrow.....

Can anyone please explain what is going on here as this is in direct opposition to my usual self.....

Normally I'm just me, no emotional feelings out of the ordinary day to day experiences....

But at night my dreams are so vivid I cry and wake up in tears...

depression,1gogah2,Feeling like I failed my life.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gogah2/feeling_like_i_failed_my_life/,0,"Hello!

Firstly, I will most probably dump in here everything I feel and just pour my heart away. It will not be a cohesive text either and I'm not sure what my point really is. I just feel like laying those ideas somewhere. If you will be wasting your time on this, I am thanking you, but don't feel obliged to do so. And please excuse any mistakes I've made as English is not my first language. 

 I am not really sure why I'm around here, but I guess I am. I suppose I want to just talk with someone. I have not been officially diagnosed with anything, so I will not claim that I have any particular issue. I used to be in therapy a few years ago, but I cannot afford that anymore. I think that the seasonal sadness hit again this year around as well, but it feels like it's harder this time. I am a 21 years old, that graduated college 3 months ago, and since then I cannot seem to be doing anything with my life. I currently have a job and I've been working since I was 18. It's not the best job and I'm paid badly, with no raise since I started, but considering the crisis we're in, I'm grateful I have at least that. After graduating, I have lost all my friends in a way, but I didn't have many to start with. Mostly they got into relationships or moved because of project/work. Things got pretty lonely for more than half a year now and I guess I started feeling it. I barely go out anymore, and I wish I could do that, but I see no point in going out on my own. I lost all interest in my hobbies and now all I do is doomscroll and smoke my lungs away. I used to love drawing/painting and I did it in high school to cope with what I was going through, but I was bullied about it and all the work I've done was treated like trash. I couldn't afford a tutor like others so my progress was slower and I was aware of that. I wanted to push through, but it got to me and now I cannot seem to do it again. It's been more than 4 years since I've stopped. I also used to read and wanted to dive into classic literature, but even that seems like a hard task to do now. In the summers I do construction work to get in some more money and because of that, I stopped working out. At first it was because I was working 20 hours daily, but now I have no excuse. I know I am wasting my own time and not doing anything productive and I don't know how to pull myself together. I am starting to fail at work too. Every task feels like it's too much and I am slower than my normal self. I'm still kind of maintaining a good facade, I try and keep up the house work and kind of take care of myself. But honestly, even washing my hair is dreadful and I lowered the times I'm doing it. 

I attempted dating for the past years, but all I got was abuse (all kinds), a short fun time for the them, and me picking my clothes up to go home. I never fell in love and I got to the conclusion that I'm pretty enough to f-, but not pretty enough to date or be loved. I tried again recently and failed miserably. Of course it was through dating apps only and the first line I would get it'd be something sexual or asked for photos. If I didn't comply with the requests I'd be an ""uninteresting woman"" or boring. That was another hard hit for me as I feel like I have no value at all. I tried to hold up the conversations, tried asking questions and being genuinely interested in their hobbies, but that didn't get me that far. I am not sure what I'm doing wrong either. I try to be supportive and kind, but I don't really get that in return.

I am not sure how to plan my life now, how to organize myself to actually do the stuff I want to do. When I hear other people that do all these amazing things, I can't help but be proud of them, but somewhere it pains my heart because I know that I am failing myself by not doing anything. If maybe you had something to help you during times like this, please share what you've done. Thank you if you read all of this, I deeply appreciate it! <3",2024-11-11 01:12:55
depression,1go62fj,Things are getting bad again ,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go62fj/things_are_getting_bad_again/,2,"I know part of this is seasonal depression laying itself on top of my year round depression. I feel like my lexapro needs to be increased but I don’t know if that’s really a good idea. The suicidal thoughts are creeping back in. It feels so stupid to have them. I’m scared to tell anybody I know irl. I don’t want my friends or boyfriend to worry. I know if I mention it to my mom she’s just going to think I’m being dramatic. That’s pretty much her response every time I’ve ever mentioned things getting bad for me. She acts like she cares but I know she doesn’t. My mom, and siblings, are part of the reason I’ve been feeling extra suicidal recently. I do so much for the household and get no thanks or appreciation in return. I have nearly depleted my savings to pay bills. Bills I was promised I wouldn’t be paying alone. Only me and my younger sister have jobs. My younger brother is constantly saying his put in this application and that application but I know it’s bullshit. He’d rather stay home playing games and whacking off. Every time I tell my sister I’m going to need a little help paying a bill she freaks out on me and it sets me off into a panic attack trying to figure out how I’m going to pay for things. So the thought of “won’t have to worry about money if I’m dead” has been crossing my mind so much in the past month. I wish I could just move out, I know it would make things better cause I could cut off my family but I’m in no financial position to do so. Plus my mom is currently reliant on my car as she doesn’t have insurance in hers and somehow I’m getting blamed for her not having had the money to renew it. She blames so many of her problems on me when all I try to do is the best I can to help her out. Even when I barely have any money in my pocket if she asks for something I’m sacrificing my sanity to make sure she has what she wants so she can be happy. Due to her relying on my car I only work the weekends right now cause god forbid if I work during the week and she need to go somewhere. It’s so frustrating cause it MY car. I paid for it. But if I bring up something like going out of town to visit my boyfriend she starts absolutely losing her shit. I’ve thought deeply about killing myself and how I would leave things. I’d for sure go a petty route and make sure all my left over money and my car didn’t go to my mom or anybody in my family. They’re not deserving. I think the only thing that’s making me hesitate right now is my relationship. We’ve only been together a couple months, but I do feel deeply for him. He also deals with depression so I’m afraid me offing myself would set him into a spiral. Or maybe it wouldn’t? Maybe he doesn’t feel as strongly about me? I do think sometimes he doesn’t really like me and is just with me to combat loneliness and to have somebody to fuck. I hope that’s not true and it’s just my brain being vile to me. I don’t even know why I’m posting here. I guess I just need to ramble. Even if nobody reads this. I have a pact with myself that if I’m not moved out and in a better spot before my 30th birthday (next year) that there’s no point in living. I’ll find pills to overdose on. Or just cut myself, and not fail this time. As I did attempt before and chickened out when I realized that dying naked in the shower would be embarrassing. Anyways, I’m going to do my best to keep living for now. But who knows if I’ll even make it through this winter 🤷🏻‍♀️ ",2024-11-10 17:38:09

Yes. My anxiety has made me extremely sad to feel so panicked as mental health is so tied together.

In the last 3 months -- my anxiety has turned into deep dark depression. The best way I can describe it is:

* Anxiety left me with panic, but energy. Energized panic. My thoughts were ping pong balls crashing into each other. I couldn't sleep, my stomach hurt, I couldn't turn the thoughts off.
* Depression has told me that nothing matters. There is no energy. I could sleep all day. I don't care if I live or die. I do not see clouds in the tunnel anymore with sunlight at the end. It's completely dark.

I was on Cymbalta for 10 years and weened off of it back in January. This was due to being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. I feel like my symptoms have changed so much but I have no desire to get better. I feel pathetic. It feels impossible to get up and get back into my routine that I have given up (healthy eating, yoga, gym, AA meetings, etc.) I have been sober for almost 5 years and do feel like I have support from the community but can't get myself to go to meetings or reach out.

I don't know what I'm trying to get out of this post but maybe I just need to hold myself accountable and hear your story that it gets better.

depression,1goalt8,Need support—circling the drain,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1goalt8/need_supportcircling_the_drain/,0,"
Hey everyone,

I’m really scared.

I’m in my 40s, and I’ve struggled with major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant, for nearly 30 years. Over the past year, things have only been getting worse. About a year ago, our landlord didn’t renew our lease, forcing us to move. My wife and I were already barely getting by, relying on my Social Security disability. I can’t work due to severe depression and chronic pain, but I keep trying to get back on my feet, only to end up back where I started—or worse.

Since the move, I’ve lost 40 pounds, going from a stable 236 lbs to under 200—the lowest I can remember in my adult life. I’m terrified because I have no appetite, and I’m watching myself shrink with every passing day. I’ve lost ~20% of my body weight in one year, and it’s a constant reminder of how badly I’m struggling. I can hide my emotions from people, but my appearance shows the toll. I feel like I’m losing control over my body, and I don’t know how to stop it.

I’m a musician, and music used to be a release, a way to express what I couldn’t put into words. But now, depression tells me, “What’s the point?” Even things I know could help feel out of reach when I’m in this state. The emptiness and hopelessness are overwhelming.

Recently, I decided to try a low-dose ketamine microdosing treatment. I’ve tried every antidepressant, and talk therapy helped at one point, but only with a therapist who really understood me. Unfortunately, he moved to private practice and no longer takes insurance. My new therapist doesn’t offer the same support—I just feel like I’m venting without real direction. And the nurse practitioner at my current clinic dismissed my long-standing medications without consideration.

The ketamine treatment has been a small glimmer of hope, but when my wife found out, things erupted. She’s in recovery, and her past experiences mean she sees ketamine as a “recreational drug,” not as a legitimate treatment. I didn’t tell her initially because I knew how she’d react, and because money is a huge issue. I’ve cut out anything non-essential from my budget to afford the treatment, but she still sees it as selfish.

I understand her concerns, but I’m desperate to try anything that might work. I feel like I’m running out of time. My weight loss is terrifying me, and every time I look in the mirror, I feel like I’m watching myself fade away. I just want her to see that this isn’t about money or “drugs”—it’s about me doing whatever it takes to survive. I feel like I’m drowning, and her support would mean everything to me.

I don’t have anyone else to turn to, and I think she doesn’t realize how much I rely on her, which I know isn’t healthy either. I’m scared, lost, and just trying to find some way out of this.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Even if you just want to tell me that things can get better, I’d be so grateful. I really need to hear something hopeful right now.

Thank you to anyone who reads this and can offer some support.",2024-11-10 20:52:52

I thought I was getting better but guess not. I'm a high school senior and everything somehow feels simultaneously pointless and so-important-I-wanna-die, even though a big step of my life is coming soon. I can't express myself properly to anyone, not even when writing online like on here, I can't even express myself properly to myself. It hurts, and I didn't think it would hurt this bad to not be able to verbalize or even conceptualize a single thing about myself. Except for this when saying this I guess, LOL. 

I guess I'm exaggerating, in a way, there's stuff about myself I know I'm sure about and can definitely use to describe myself. I'm pretty sure there is something I'm undiagnosed with, but I don't even know if it's worth pursuing. I know that the next four years are probably going to suck cause I'm a latino lesbian in the U.S. and well, yk. But even aside from that, I just have nothing. My only passion is fashion and even then I can't get myself up to do anything related to it. 

The only thing that makes me feel okay is talking to my friends, so I just end up feeling like a burden to them. My family loves me and even school is going well, but I can't stop crying during all my classes and at home and I just hate myself for it. Anyways, all my problems really aren't as important or horrible as anyone else's, so I don't even know why I feel like this. There's no reason I should be whining like this, there's no reason why I should be wanting to die, but I still am. ",2024-11-11 00:14:49

depression,1go993b,I think I'm loosing one of my best friends and I don't know how to handle this,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go993b/i_think_im_loosing_one_of_my_best_friends_and_i/,0,"I've been suffering from severe depression again for six months, and in the summer everything came to such a head that I was in acute danger of harming myself and others - my close friends knows this. I've become very withdrawn and have less and less contact with them. I've been in treatment for 12 years and they know that too.

In the meantime, things have improved somewhat (my suicidal thoughts have decreased), but I'm still in survival mode. I only go to work or to the shops. My social contacts are zero. I don't even contact my friends anymore, it's just too exhausting - even if it's just a quick message. But they know about my condition, and it's not the first time - in fact, it happens a lot. But that's not the only reason. I've spoken openly with some of them about my condition, and I've usually come away from the conversation feeling worse. I know they don't mean any harm, but some statements hit you like a slap in the face...things like: “At least you're HEALTHY!” - “It'll go away!” - “Life is hard for everyone!” - “Overcome your self-imposed barriers and start living!” - “Just do everything that seems unimaginable to you!” - and so on...

Two weeks ago, one of my closest friend wrote me a short text message and asked me why I wasn't getting in touch. I briefly told her that I couldn't at the moment and that everything was difficult and tedious. She said that I didn't have to go through this alone and suggested that she come over to my place and we could go for a walk. I declined and asked her if we could talk on the phone in the next few days. Unfortunately, I didn't make it again. A week later, she sent me a voice message that I couldn't even listen to. She knows that I've been mentally ill for years, so it's nothing new to her - we're very close. But it's never been as bad as it is now.

That was a few days ago. Yesterday was another day when I was lying in bed trying to cope with everything somehow. In the afternoon, she texted me: “Hello?” - “Why aren't you answering?” - “I'm worried” - then she called me twice (went to voicemail because I had “do not disturb” on), but I just couldn't answer or call her back because I felt a pressure and was kind of scared. I understand that she's worried, but I just can't. Then suddenly my doorbell rang several times and I was lying in bed, paralyzed. She then called me and then sent me another message to tell me that she is at my door asking if I just turned off my cell phone (which I didn't) and that if I don't answer by tonight, she will call my family because she feels really bad.

It really hurts me that I'm treating my friend like this, but I just can't. This action in turn puts me under so much pressure and puts me under so much stress that I want to contact her even less. Although I think the whole thing is inappropriate, I then sent her a short message: “Hey, I don't have the energy to get in touch at the moment and I don't have the energy for social contact. I'll get back to you when I'm feeling better.”She replied: “I understand that you're feeling bad, but you have to at least get in touch. Today I was worried about whether you were still alive and I felt really sick that I had already contacted your friends. I'm going to leave you alone anyway, but I don't think it's too much to ask you to at least reply briefly, because it's not nice having to panic every time I ask if you're okay. I just don't know what to do”

Her answer hit me like a slap in the face. I feel so bad. I'm a burden to her.

Btw: Two months ago she got married and I was her maid of honor. I wrote her a long and profound letter about our years of friendship and how grateful I am to have her in my life, and that I'm grateful that she understands and accepts my condition and doesn't take it personally when I don't get in touch, or can just be a good friend like I actually am. And now I think I've lost one of my closest friends.

my best friend of 7 years went away a couple of months ago to study,

a few months before she left i was in quite a major depressive episode (wouldnt leave the house, wouldn’t eat, called off work nearly everyday to just do nothing) 

i’ve never really spoken to her about my depression before because i just never really thought that i needed to, until this episode started, this was honestly the worst that it had been, and it did affect our relationship because i was so numb i just couldn’t do anything, so sometime i would call off our hangouts until i realised that she was going to be leaving soon and i wouldn’t see her for ages.

so i started putting as much effort as i could into rebuilding our relationship before she left and i tried to be completely honest with her and tell her that i was struggling and that it wasn’t anything personal with her, just something that i needed to work out on my own. 

so now it is 2 months since she’s left and she just sent me a long paragraph about how in the lead up to her leaving that i only wanted to hang out with her while i was struggling, and that made her like shit, which yes it definitely would.

but how can i even explain that it’s not just when i was hanging out with her? it was literally 24/7 that i was feeling that way. i’ve tried to explain but she said that she is only interested in “life giving” friendships from now on and doesn’t see how our friendship will continue because i’m not very life giving at the moment.

currently i’m still struggling, i have been for a while, i love my friend so much more than anything in the world but i can’t lie and say that i am life giving, although i wish i was but i just don’t know when i will be again. i’ve changed medications multiple times, been to different doctors, tried different life style changes, diets, i’ve tried so much that i just don’t even see a point anymore.

I am in my second year of nursing school at a relatively prestigious college in my area and I have begun to feel the worst possible self esteem issues I have ever experienced.

Overall, I just feel like a failure. I make all A's in college and everyone tells me how amazing I am but I don't believe them. I feel ugly, I feel disgusting, I feel like my life is a mistake, I hate myself, genuinely. This isn't the first time I have felt like this. I started SH in the 4th grade. I stopped after my parents found out, and since then I feel like they see me differently. Without going into too much detail, I did again in April of this year but it was a one time thing after my boyfriend talked to me about it.

Every week is just pushing off assignments until the last possible moment, I scrape by with good grades but at what cost? My mental health? The thoughts of SH are coming back and I hate it. Every day I struggle. I can't get out of bed, I can't brush my teeth, I can't shower, I can't study for school. I just waste away in bed. I have an exam coming up and I feel like I will fail, and if I do, my parents will think less of me.

I have built my entire life around perfection. My family sees me as perfect. I wanted to go to nursing school because I genuinely loved it, but now that I'm well into it, I want to quit. I feel like I cannot go on. However, my parents have put so much money and time into my education I can't go back now.

I am unable to get professional help. I have explained to my father that I am not okay and he tells me things like ""life gets better"" ""I don't need professional help or drugs"" ""Our family doesn't have feelings like that, and if we did, you wouldn't know because we keep on pushing through"" I am on his health insurance and I am a full time student and completely dependent on him financially. I cant book my own appointments because he would not be willing to pay for it.

I am stuck in a vicious cycle. I know I need help. I know I can't get help. My school resources are terrible. I feel like I am living a lie. I have everything I need to be happy and I am not. I have noticed physical changes in my health as well. I have gained almost 30 pounds since last year since I have become dependent on fast food and don't have to motivation to cook for myself. It makes the situation worse. I want to get better but I just can't.

I used to be so healthy and thin. I have literally let myself waste away. I ran cross country and track in high school and I genuinely can't even fathom exercising like I used to. I feel as if my health has declined so rapidly I would die of a heart attack if I tried any kinds of aerobic exercise.

I cannot stand how I am living right now. I need help. Nothing brings me any joy anymore. There is nothing I look forward to. Every day is a living hell and I can't escape.

Theres so much more I can say but I really don't know where to begin. Theres so many issues that I don't even know what the main problem is at this point. Im hanging on for dear life. Please help.",2024-11-10 23:30:03

idk if i am really depressed or im just bad at coping with what everyone feels. if so, i am unworthy of being alive. i never really fit in anywhere. i have no friends because i am so bad at keeping relationships. i cut off people like its nothing even if i have been friends with them for years. now i have no friends because of my own actions. i can change and morph myself to have friends if i really wanted to. but it is all a facade. will i have to keep living this way to continue life successfully. this word is built off of practicality and no one has time for showing how they really are. i joined clubs this year to 'make friends' and 'build my future'. but its not working. i go to the social events and i may blend in well. but inside, i am rotting away. i can't keep doing this. i will snap again and i know it.

i thought i was getting better truly but how many times have i felt this way. a million. it is literally a distraction. a delusion. i **always** come back to this rotting miserable hopeless place where i can no longer look at the mirror, eat like an absolute monster to numb away all my feelings or absolutely not eat at all because i feel nothing, skip classes, hurt myself, isolate myself, sleep to pass time or not sleep at all and mindlessly watch random shit till my brain can take no more and for what. for what. i don't know why i am like this. i still keep up with my grades as it never been a concern for me. so why am i like this. i am capable to fake it till i make it quite literally. but it is building up. this absolute clownery. i want to disappear. to be unborn. i want no take of this world. i am ungrateful which is more of a reason why my existence has no worth.

everyone must feel this way as a human. but they cope. that is where i utterly fail. there is no way someone has never felt or thought the way i am thinking. we are extremely intellectual beings creating this facade of a society because it is the only way to live coherently and coexist in peace without killing each other to keep the world spinning. then what must i do. what am i if i can not keep up with the pace of being human. does that not make me worthy to live. what am i if not human. i fail to keep connections yet long for connection as a natural instinct of being human. i fail to feel connection with others. i fail to value my blessings. is my worth just the collection of contributions i can make to keep the world spinning. to keep smiling and show the world the results of my hard work and nothing more. just die after. it is not worth it. it can't be.

perhaps i have some kind of anatomical issue with my brain. afterall we are only just a product of neurotransmissions in response to stimuli.  since i am not 25, perhaps my frontal lobe has failed to fully mature. but must i wait until so. must i endure this any longer. living an endless loop of misery. i can create the dopamine and serotonin rush by going on runs, socializing with my clubs and really reaching out like i have, becoming obsessed w 'the grind' like last year. but is is just a front. and all of it, no matter what hides the fact of how disgusted and empty i am.

i have tried to kill myself a few times by short rope hanging but i never went through until the end since i got scared i hate to admit. why must i have an instinct to not die. it is miserable to live and yet i can not even push through to death. i have cut myself over the years to feel something and to somewhat release this ongoing, almost physical pressure in my head.

i never went to a doctor or therapist about this because it just feels so stupid. the collection of this whole thing feel utterly meaningless. if i was given antidepressants, i don't know how well it would even work as it quite literally just messes around with the receptors in your head without fixing the emptiness inside. all so i can function and slave away for this fake world. i also do not want to tell anyone because it feels like i am reaching out for attention or something. idk. ive been to a therpaist once actually but very briefly. i felt so stupid and inferior talking about my issues as my therapist just watched me speak. she didn't do anything wrong. i just felt wrong the whole time. idk how to explain it. it felt like she was just judging me and checking boxes in her head on what to diagnose me or something. but like i said, she didn't even say anything bad or something but all these words of 'encouragement' felt almost fake. and the worst part is like its timed so when time is up, its just awkward and feels so business like you know. like there is something wrong with me officailly and i just go to the doctor to get a 'checkup' and times up and boom, its over. see you next session! kind of thing. like im just were just another “case” to get through. 

i mean i shared this once with my only genuine friend of 8 years(she no longer talks to me) and she said i was too privileged to be talking and that i am just pitying myself. My entire family also say the same thing. they just say i lack knowing God since i grew up in a Christian household. and im afraid doctors will just tell me i have something wrong with the balance of hormones or neurotransmission in my head and just pop pills into my system until i ""think right"". And a therapist is just doing their job. in the end, feelings dont really matter in the real world now. im not sure if i rly am worthy to be feeling this way. this must mean there is something horribly wrong with me. something absolutely disgusting and unexplainable about myself.

i should just die. all of these complications in my head will all be gone and i can finally breathe in a sense.

it feels wrong to share this with anyone because it is so stupid and feelings are not really real in a sense because it comes and it goes. well for me this feeling is persistent for a while now but idk. im good at talking sure if need be, but when it comes to my personal life and feelings, i become almost paralyzed and i can not speak it out loud. i can't reveal my sickening thoughts and my true self to anyone and be naked and afraid. i don't want to get better either as i feel this is just who i am. if i get 'better (whatever that means)' who will i then be? and yet i hate myself for it. what is this irony.

and it just feels strange because people usually get sad as a reaction to something bad happening to them like a breakup, losing someone, feelings of worthlessness, having no friends or something. but idk this misery i have is like self-inflicted from just thinking too much. i have lost people in my life but it is mostly because of me just shutting people out and isolating myself. all about me. am i narcissistic?  why do i always just think abt me? damn lol. idek anymore.

must i continue living this way. there is no out. idek why i am posting this. maybe it is just because i long for someone to feel the same way as i do. to find some kind of sickening comfort that i am not alone as if that will change anything. idk if im rly depressed bc i feel like depression is just the worst of the worst yk. idk what i am. maybe putting a label just reinforced bad things so idk. nothing is real right.

\-- i also come from a Christian household that does not believe in depression but the ""lack of God"" so please, if you are thinking the same and about God being my savior, i already know. i know all of it trust me. the holy spirit, jesus dying for me, yk all of the religion stuff i mean i was practically forced to memorize hundreds of bible verses and stuff. so yeah, i believe that He is real and stuff, but i am not going to wait for God to just magically appear or seek out and gain some kind of ""enlightening"" because trust me, i tried. and yea maybe i need to try more but srsly if what all this religion is teaching me is that there is something wrong w me because i am not able to contain God. no hate to any religion out there, i just wanted to say this cuz ppl have tried a million times about God being the only cure to happiness or fullfilment and maybe it worked for them but it doesn't work for me. yea i dont know every single bit of detail abt Christianity and stuff but honestly im not interested. all i believe is that God is real and He died for us. thats about it. everything else is doctrine that works for most ppl it seems but idk man, not for me. --",2024-11-10 23:22:39
depression,1go8rtf,Depression and ADHD,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go8rtf/depression_and_adhd/,5,"Anyone who’s Adhd and having depressive symptoms as well? I feel like my dopamine is way too low, I can’t start anything, I have zero motivation and even doing nothing hurts, like I need constant stimulation and tv shows don’t even give me enough pleasure anymore, I need either caffeine, sugar/food or at least something that really gets to my brain. The caffeine isn’t really working anymore tho, because I’ll have one hour, maybe two of feeling “ok” and somewhat happy but then I crash, not only feeling fatigued but also deeply depressed, especially at the end of the day. So I guess no coffee and energy drinks for me anymore which means food is literally the only thing that makes me happy and makes me feel normal and I think then my dopamine levels (during eating) are the same as other people their regular dopamine levels when they’re just living. It’s so exhausting constantly being way below that baseline I’m done I’m so done. I guess alcohol works too, but I’m not trying to become an alcoholic and I already drink quite a bit 1-2 days a week. Smoking doesn’t work either, it just takes away my stress a little but not the emptiness inside me. I’ve tried literally everything and Adhd medication makes me more depressed too so it’s not sustainable for me. Does anybody feel this way too or is my brain just fucked?",2024-11-10 19:33:34

I am really really depressed. I have been unable tow ork or focus on anything, all I want to do is sleep. I am in my last year at an extremely competitive US university, and I intentionally structured my term to be as easy as possible so I could focus on my applications for grad school. My grad school applications have frankly felt like a disaster. Despite doing 4 summers of undergraduate research I have 0 publications to show for it, basically I completely wasted my time and because of that no one will want me for grad school  in my field. 

Me and my long time girlfriend broke it off in the spring because she was a year above me. She got into a really good grad school and we knew we weren't going to do the long distance thing, but then she blocked me on everything and we couldn't even talk as friends. This has stung really really bad and I can't help but compare my performance now to how well things turned out for her. She got into a good grad school and now I'd be lucky to get in anywhere. I have also begun resenting her deeply. She told me she'd help me with grad apps since I helped her so much, but then she just fully cuts me off. She said I could still email her about it, but frankly I don't think she meant it. I have started to hate her, and if I got into the grad school she goes to I think I wouldn't go there just to avoid her. 

I have a side porject thing that I spend my time on but I haven;t been able to focus on that at all. It's very important to me for personal and it's like falling apart, which hasn't felt very good either. My grades have been struggling and I just feel so fucking sad all the goddamn time. 

I have been thinking about suicide a lot more recently. My mom visited me this week and I think that made me realize that I couldn't kill myself, but it's just so hard to keep on living. I think this is the last good time in my life to die to be honest. I don't want to live knowing that I failed at achieving my dreams, I'd rather die now when I'm still someone worth remembering. 

I hate myself so much. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up. Sleep is my favorite thing. Why can't I just do that forever?",2024-11-10 23:08:01

depression,1godjaw,Feeling like I'm living for others and forgetting myself,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1godjaw/feeling_like_im_living_for_others_and_forgetting/,0,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a med student, and from the outside, I think people see me as someone who’s got it all together—a “good example,” if you will. But honestly, there’s something I’ve been struggling with deeply, and I wonder if others feel the same way.

I find myself depending heavily on other people's responses and interactions, especially on social media. I get attached easily, and my mood can swing depending on whether someone replies or reaches out. It’s like my happiness is in their hands. And if I don’t get a response or feel like I’m putting in way more effort than I get back, my mood just plummets into a really negative, anxious state.

Even though I’m super busy with everything I have going on, I still make time for people because I genuinely care about them. But it feels like they take that for granted, almost as if they just expect it. I care too much about their lives and well-being, sometimes at the cost of my own. Meanwhile, they seem to live their lives happily and normally, without ever needing to prioritize me in return. And though they respond when I reach out, I often feel like I’m the one doing most of the work just to keep things going.

Honestly, I think I’m at the lowest point I’ve been in a while. I keep wondering if I’m losing myself by putting so much energy into people who don’t reciprocate as strongly. I just feel stuck and like I’m being pulled in two different directions—trying to be there for others, but desperately wanting to feel valued too.

Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with these feelings, especially if you’re also someone others see as a “good example” or someone who’s expected to have it all figured out?

depression,1god28w,Suicidal Friend Brings Me Down,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1god28w/suicidal_friend_brings_me_down/,1,"
I have a friend from college in his mid-20s. We were close from freshman year through senior year, but after graduation, I moved away to start my career. He, on the other hand, chose to get married instead of finishing school. We drifted apart naturally as he was focused on his married life, and we rarely kept in touch.

Throughout college, he had experimented with drugs and didn’t have family nearby, but he was always likable and well-meaning. Unfortunately, after his divorce, things took a downward turn. He began reaching out to me more often, venting about his struggles, and I tried to be there to listen. Then he started therapy, but he began blaming me and other friends from college for “ruining” his marriage. I kept supporting him, especially when he seemed to be teetering on the edge, even though his accusations hurt. Over time, I felt like I was sticking around mostly out of pity.

After a while, things seemed to improve a bit. He moved to a different state, finished his degree, and found a job. The angry messages lessened, and I thought he might be finding some stability. But recently, he moved again to an expensive city, where he doesn’t have many friends or coworkers. He sold his car, thinking he could rely on public transit, but he couldn’t secure housing near a metro. Now he’s struggling financially, can barely get to work, and is still dealing with alcoholism. His family lives six hours away, and it’s unclear if he even talks to them.

At this point, my friends and I feel drained. Every time we try to help, he ends up lashing out and we can’t help him anymore. We’re honestly only staying in touch to keep him from hitting rock bottom or becoming homeless.

Any advice on how to handle this?",2024-11-10 22:39:15

depression,1go41l0,"Help, advice 🙏",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go41l0/help_advice/,0,"I believe it all started with a moment of anxiety over a supposed health issue. But suddenly, I found myself in a different state, as if I were trapped inside a transparent, tightly sealed box. I can see the world happening outside and even interact with it, but I feel stuck, strange, as if I'm distant and confused. It’s hard to describe… everything feels dull, without pleasure, and especially without appetite. Even lying in bed has become difficult. Sometimes, it seems I find some relief only when, for a few minutes, I can ""escape"" from this box and shut down, but sleep is light and fragmented.

I have type 2 diabetes and hypertension, recently changed some medications, and I'm taking Ozempic. I'm even considering stopping Ozempic, as this depressive state and lack of appetite have been intense. I also started desvenlafaxine about 6 days ago after trying sertraline, which seemed to make everything worse. Now, with a new psychiatrist, we’re trying to adjust the treatment, but this constant internal anguish is exhausting.

What I really want is to be able to lie down and feel some comfort, but even that has been hard. Has anyone gone through something like this? How did you manage to get out of it?

Around the start of November a form of OCD has infiltrated my mind, forming unwanted thoughts like for example: What if I killed myself or I want to kill myself and even what’s the purpose of my life or if any of this is real, which was a thought I had when waking up this morning…I think all of this had formed due to the recent hurricane helene which had caused me to stay in the house for a week straight. But during the time of the hurricane I felt none of these feelings and was just glad I was safe and alive, before the hurricane I volunteered at my local humane society and joined a college basketball team that I did attend to yesterday, but as for the humane society I haven’t been in about a month or two. I don’t know if this is seasonal depression mixed in with my OCD or just not being able to do anything and lost my sense of purpose…my mom always opens up my curtains to see the front yard, but I always seem to look up at the sky out the window and just wonder “what’s the point of my life or what’s the point of life.” I cant differentiate if this is me thinking this on purpose or it’s just another unwanted thought.

PS: I am getting professional help from my therapist and have recently gotten meds for my OCD.

Another note: I have a condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has taken my ability to walk and has made my bones weaker than average person.",2024-11-10 19:35:10
depression,1go8lit,My family would be better off without me,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go8lit/my_family_would_be_better_off_without_me/,1,"Ever since high school I feel like I’ve been slowly spiraling downwards. I WANT to go do things. I WANT to meet people. I WANT to get a job. But I don’t even know where to start. Years ago I told myself that I would kill myself after my senior year of high school because I just couldn’t see a future for myself. At the time I was in denial about my gender dysphoria and too scared to ask for help because I didn’t think there was anything to be done. I’m sure I was depressed back then too but I hadn’t been diagnosed and didn’t want to assume, and I got through the days just fine, so I just ignored it like every other emotion. Well… senior year came and went, I got accepted to go to college, and I convinced myself that once I got to college things would be better. I was going to study computer science, something I had always been sort of interested in, and I think I kind of tricked myself into feeling almost excited about it. I had family that lived close to campus so I stayed with them and that was much nicer than the dorm situation. But I got there and the excitement almost immediately vanished. I was still repressing all my feelings regarding my gender identity, I still felt extremely depressed and hopeless, and I fucking hate computer science as it turns out. Everything that I had thought would change either stayed the same or got worse. My first semester went fine, I did drop one class but I did it quickly enough that the bad grade didn’t get counted. The next semester was equally uneventful, except for the fact that I started crying more than I had before. And then the start of my second year happened. After a few weeks of class I just couldn’t bring myself to go anymore. I would get up and get ready but once I made it to the parking lot I would break down in my car because I just couldn’t bring myself to go to class. I tried my best to get work done but I couldn’t focus and everything felt hopeless so why bother? My grades started slipping. I skipped multiple classes every week, I stopped exercising regularly, and I started spending most of my free time alone in my bedroom. I tried to keep myself occupied with hobbies but I just didn’t care enough to actually enjoy anything I was doing. When I went home for Christmas that year I told my parents about my grades and that I wanted to die. They had me drop my classes for the next semester so that I could stay home and take a break from school. I felt useless but I started a part time job, started exercising and losing weight again, and from day to day I think I felt a bit better. But I had to register for classes for the following year and I chose to change to an online program through  the same college so that I could stay at home because I thought that might be better for me. It wasn’t. I fucked that up too. After another failed semester I finally told them about my gender dysphoria because it felt like it was eating me alive. Once again I dropped all of my classes. That was about a year ago. In that time I got a therapist, started HRT about 6 months ago, and got a raise at my part time job. But now I’m here and it all still feels hopeless. My parents are worried about me because they don’t understand trans people and because I currently don’t have any plans for the future. I’m just existing and for the past month or so my mental health feels like it’s gotten even worse. I’m almost 22 now and people my age are graduating and moving forward with their lives. They have passions and dreams. I… don’t. I don’t feel any drive to do better, I don’t have a passion for anything anymore, I don’t have any idea how to even function in society. On top of all that, the only good decision I’ve made in my adult life was to start transitioning and even that feels like it’s stuck in a rut. Nothing is working and it’s my fault because I’ve stopped trying. I hate that I’ll never be the person my parents wanted me to be. I used to be a smart kid and I don’t know what happened. It feels like I can barely focus on anything throughout the day. I don’t know how I’m supposed to ever go back to school if I’m this stupid. And the worst part is that my parents love me so much. They tell me that they’re proud of me, they take care of me, they aren’t going to kick me out. But all I can do is disappoint them and I’m so so sick of it. I’m a burden and I’ve wasted every opportunity that they’ve worked so hard to give me. I feel like my life is over before it’s even really begun and it’s my fault. I deserve to die, just to lessen the burden on my family.",2024-11-10 19:26:07

I can feel my depression keeps me running in circles. Everything I do is just an attempt to distract myself from how I really feel inside.

It activates all my fears and I can literally hear the voice inside of me screaming I’m worthless and that nothing matters. I finally have a chance, a well paying job and an apartment.

Me (F25), had a seizure on 5 December 2021. 
I was dieting at that time. For about 6 months. 
The lack of nutrients and the fact that I was I high achiever in med school. Made me so tired, I could not sleep and hence: I got a seizure in the bathroom while showering. 

I hit my head on the floor and my neck hit the shower wall. I was not conscious, for like 10 minutes. The ambulance arrived quickly, but I has behaving like an animal. ( this is normal after a seizure. 

They took me to the hospital. Took some scans. Besides my neck everything was ok. 

3 weeks after is slowly developed major depression disorder. I was so unhappy, but I had lost weight quickly. My family only complemented and how great I looked. “ you’re finally not a giant anymore).  “You were so huge you looked like a monster. Hence my brother said this to me.

My mother treated with more love.  All of a sudden I had guys crushing over me. I was popular. She always told me that I am only beautiful I am the side of a stick. 

I’ve gained weighted this time. 
I moved to a different house, and she hated how I got the bigger broom. After when I got back from school, she never asked me about em or my grades. When my brothers came home from work she was so enthousiast

I pointed this out. She told me that it’s all in my head. And that I am just like my father who was a a severely mental ill person. She told stories about the past. Knowing that I would drive me crazy.

She made breakfast for my two brothers but not for me. She also left the little plate of food for me.
Completing and how my sister in law is so beautiful while before she always talked badly about her.

Eventually everybody got sick of my depression. 
They told me to get out her their house. How everybody is tired of me, how I always bring problems. My cousin talked about of how tiring it is to hang out with me and she does not want me around anymore, she told this to my younger brother. 

My younger brother, told me how much he hated me. My mother did not cook breakfast anymore for me. ( I gained weight). She pretends like she did not know which your I was born on which month, and how old I am.

When my birthday came she ignored me. Talked out loud to her boyfriend( who only I know about) I asked her to get me smoothies she did not. She rolled her eyes when she said that she had to buy me a present.  This is the time where I have gaine a lot of weight. 

My cousin spilled all
My secret to her whole family. While she swore she did not.
Laughed when I did not want to be here anymore. She tried to put my younger brother against me. 

I want to block her on instagram so badly and on WhatsApp like every plat form. But  I am afraid she will spread more rumors about me. 
She told me in the past, that my skin is so dark,
“My mom told me I was a black as you when little, my mommy says I am getting whiter” she told me
I am so ugly that I need a face lift. I was sixteen at that time

Mind you, I’m afghan. We both have the same skin color. When in visited her in Spain she told me that no one would consider me Spanish. Because of the color of my skin. The minute
I walked outside, they all told me I look south Spanish. She got passieve agressieve and ignored it.

I lost a lot of weight again. My mother is nicer to me. And in general everyone is. My mother moved to Australia for her partner. I called her yesterday Australia time zonde crying about my ear infection. 

She got mad, because she thought it was “something serious”. She used her work as an excuse to hang up on me after 3 minutes. Her work is watching elderly people who lost of the time sleep.

I study medicine, something my cousin always wanted. But she failed never got in. While in did. Her mother hated it. The both enjoyed how bad my depression was. 

My mother helps me with I need money. She had always been great until she moven to Australia. It is like she cares 0 F*c. I feel so guilty to feel so much anger. Because “i escaped Afghanistan thank to her”

 She promised me that she would call me about my infections be she did not.

Should I say something about it like “ that’s for calling me”. Or should I let it slide because she has been a great mother, before her move to Australia with her parent 2 years ago.

depression,1go7s8h,Some more venting,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go7s8h/some_more_venting/,0,"After one year I finally reached out to a psychiatrist again. It’s very difficult where I live to find a psychiatrist, let alone any kind of therapists. I‘m not that hopeful that she’s available , but let’s see.

I’m pretty sure I have Cptsd, avpd (bordering on shizoid), clinical depression and traits of other disorders. I always said it’s the avpd that makes my life hell, but I’ve been a bit more depressed lately which made me realize they’re all bad. My avpd symptoms might be less currently but neither one of them is better or worse than the other.

I’ve been to therapy for many years. I’ve also been to a mental hospital (which I do not recommend to anyone. I’d rather spend my life in jail than go to another mental hospital). 
I feel like I’m therapy resistant. My memory is just getting worse and like I mentioned in my previous post my disconnection to my emotional being is so severe I don’t think I could tell this therapist anything. I don’t really have access to my memories. It’s like my memories are saved in pictures. No emotions, no words nor sounds attached to it. And it would require an immense amount of energy to find words to those pictures. 
It’s just incredibly tiring to explain myself. I did talk about my worries, my trauma etc. But I’m done. I don’t really have anything to say anymore. I’m not sure why I’ve written her in the first place. I have 0 hope that my life will ever get better.

I just wanna lay in bed until I die but unfortunately I have chronic back pain and get frequent migraines (too little and too much sugar e.g. triggers it - meaning I’m forced to eat or else I get terrible headaches). I also have nervous problems (stabbing sensations). The doctors found nothing of course.

For a while I had an alcohol problem because I needed to cope with my miserable life but I don’t even feel like drinking anymore. 

I never actively tried to take my own life and I’m not sure if I will ever do it. I don’t know why I’m not doing it. I think I’m just subconsciously praying that some sickness will finally take me.

depression,1go1zga,Incredibly Depressed Lately,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go1zga/incredibly_depressed_lately/,4,"Hi All,

I'm writing this as a way to get a lot off my chest. I'm sitting here in a coffee shop enormously depressed; I'm surprised I even found the energy to get to the coffee shop this morning, but I couldn't sleep a lick last night so I figured I'd get up and do something as opposed to laying in bed tossing and turning while not sleeping.

To give you some background, I'm a 35-year-old single male, never married, no kids. I grew in a wonderful household, with great parents and an amazing younger brother. My extended family is incredible as well. This is all to say that I have a great support system, and am fortunate that I avoided any sort of dysfunction that some families have. But along these lines, I'm wondering where I went wrong, and where I go from here. The rest of my cousins are married with kids, and I just went to a beautiful wedding last night of one of my younger cousins. I put on a happy face, but deep down inside I was absolutely miserable.

On the outside, I have a good amount going for me. I pursued multiple degrees and postgrad, and today have a coveted job where I make over $500k a year. But it all feels empty anymore, I wake up with literally zero motivation to live out the day ahead.

Growing up through high school, I was very shy and introverted. I broke out of my shell in college and loved it. But it wasn't until right after I graduated that I started getting any attention from girls. I was a virgin until the year after I graduated college. Mostly because of a lack of interest from girls, but the other force at play was my Catholic upbringing and my extreme fear of having sex and getting a girl pregnant at a young age whilst not being married. It was an irrational fear, but that didn't make it any less in my head. In fact, my first year out of college I began hanging out with a popular group of people I knew from a few friends and ended up dating one of the girls in the group who I believed to be out of my league. It only lasted a year but it completely devastated me when she broke up with me basically because I was too scared to have sex with her. Crazy, I know, but my parents, especially my dad, are incredibly important to me and I always operated in a way to never disappoint them; they mean the world to me.

Fast forward after that, I took a few years to concentrate on my career and pursue postgrad, and then have basically been single ever since with brief periods of girlfriends. Throughout my mid-to-later 20's I got a lot of attention from women, something I had never been used to. But for some reason, I would never date for a while. I am at heart, introverted, so I think my lack of communication really ruined a lot of potential relationships. In high school, I was painfully shy, and I think that really had a traumatic effect on me. I think deep down, I have a very poor opinion of myself because of those years and intrinsically find a woman to be less attractive if they are attracted to me. Which brings me to the latest.

A year ago, my company let me work remotely so I moved 1,000 miles away to a city I had visited a lot during COVID that I really liked. Basically a much warmer place than where I'm from. I wanted a fresh start. I think in a way I was running away from responsibilities to a certain extent. I have a large network of family and friends in my home city, so there would often be a lot of events that I would feel obligated to attend. Attending these got to a point where it was excruciating; I would be the old single guy whereas all my family and friends would be there with their wives and kids. I felt like people looked at me as if I had three eyes. It just was incredibly awkward and I did not enjoy it one bit.

Fast forward to today, and while I love the new city where I live and how physically active I am, I'm learning that the same issues have followed me, and even worse I hardly have any family or friends there so dating is tough as I don't have a rich social life here.

During this time, I have been keeping in touch with a girl from back in my home city that I didn't realize how much I truly liked. I had asked her to coffee this weekend as I'm back in town for my cousin's wedding but she told me she now has a boyfriend; I was absolutely crushed. My stomach has been in knots the whole weekend. I feel truly alone.

At the very least, I'm starting to realize I need to grow up. Like I said, I have a good job, but I've stopped going out and drinking and have given up gambling, something I have used as a crutch the last few years. During the last few years when I have been drinking heavier on the weekends and gambling, it really didn't bother me being single as I was preoccupied with these vices. I'd work all week, and then when I had the brief amount of free time that I do, I'd fill it with these vices. Now, I'm realizing that I truly need to get my act together. This realization has really weighed on my mental pysche as I've realized the time and opportunities I've wasted. Losing the woman recently that I had thought I would eventually start something with hit me like a ton of bricks. But I need to grow up and really act like a man, instead of waiting for the woman to really initiate. I have been too immature and I think it all relates back to my elementary/high school years when I was short and scrawny and felt nothing like a real boy. I have always felt inadequate.

Anyways, thanks for hearing out my rant. My mind is all over the place, but it helps me to vent. Hopefully one day we will all come out the other side of mental anguish. I feel completely hopeless and miserable at the moment, but have no option but to trudge through.",2024-11-10 14:35:31

I went to a big university after graduating high school from 2017-2020. I limped along during that time due to previous battles with depression, anxiety, and trauma.

Then the pandemic happened and I dropped out of school, got hospitalized twice (first time for suicidal thoughts and ideation. Second time for a failed suicide attempt.) And stayed out of school for about a year or two, before doing part-time school and officially earning my AA degree in 2023 (yay for that).

I resumed my pursuit of secondary math education as a full-time student and got straight A's. I am finishing up my second to last semester right now. My next semester would be my internship.

The problem is that I have lost my faith in myself as being a good, capable, or effective teacher. I also don't know if I'd even enjoy teaching in the end. I feel so destroyed for having invested so much blood, sweat, and tears into a career path that I now need to escape from right at the last minute.

First, English is not my mother tongue, so please bear with me. I've my post but for some reason, it wasn't published, so fuck that. I came here to write my final letter. God knows I've tried seeking any available help, but to no avail. I will never be loved or successful. My creative writing career, once my source of happiness, has put on half after many recent depressive episodes. The worse thing is that I've started to compare myself with my fellow writers on how they are able to produce works and love writing. I can't shift my thinking to be like theirs, and I hate myself so much for that. I feel like I will never be fit in any social places, and always the one who make excuses and cut ties first due to I get jealous of how my friends are so loved by others and easy to be around with. I've tried to learn and act like them of course, but I am just not them, you know, and perpetually got ignored in a group. I know too well that's a very negative way of thinking and don't worry it's also one of the justified reason why I should kms.

depression,1go0vdf,A Rant On My Problems,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go0vdf/a_rant_on_my_problems/,7,"**(This is gonna be really long)**

Something you've gotta know about me is that I'm Christian. Conservative, Baptist, Evangelical Christian. And since my early teens I've struggled w/ homosexuality as a whole. I've literally tried ""*changing*"" or having friends to help me and literally nothing seems to work. Overall I feel like I'm trapped in a rut. Additionally I've got an infatuation over a guy that I know:  
1) won't like me back (cause he's straight)  
2) my Christian ass won't let me have a homosexual relationship without guilt  
I really hate myself for liking this person; tbh friends have asked what I even *see* in him (plus this ain't even my first time).  
Furthermore my parents come from an extremely rural background and I'm the first of my generation from my family to be living in the capital. They say it's ""a privilege"" and maybe yes, but honestly it feels more like a burden. A responsibility to be the elder brother. A responsibility to learn a language neither my parents know well. A responsibility to seek education at a level my parents didn't. A responsibility to make the right choices, attend church weekly, make right relationships, do this do that. *I really can't take it anymore.*

I have too many choices to make and honestly as a young person I don't feel like I want to deal w/ any of this shit. I just want to live a ""normal"" life. Honestly I wish I could find true love without feeling like I'm getting sky daddy angry. I wish I could just be me. 

The educational institute at which I attend has a fair share of my troubles too. I just feel overburdened by work, my broken self. I have ""talents"" in many co-curricular activities that literally makes me the centre of focus for every. single. school. event. Furthermore I'm at a point where my studies matter a lot lot (And honestly I'd say I do pretty good) but because of the myriad of EXPECTATIONS I literally feel burnt out and depressed constantly. Also, remember I said my parents were rural? Yeah, half my family are drunks and the other half are still barely making it. My parents are the sole ""serious"" breadwinners for the family. And so finances are strained. My school is pretty expensive and so, most students are sons of politicians or sons of administrative officers, doctors, lawyers (pretty much society's bigshots) and they have the financial means to do whatever they want in school and probs their parents could just land them a job the moment they graduate. I, on the other hand am trying my best and I really don't want to anymore. I just want to give up. To die. To dissapear. The only two things keeping me alive are my parents (whom I'm truly concerned of) and my genuine love for God.

So yeah, I'm really REALLY depressed. And I don't know what to do.

Tbh I even wish someone would just murder me cause the Christian law never says death by murder is a sin.

Oh well.

But I never wrote anything related to me. And yes. I have been suffering from depression. It's been a while. Maybe 6 or 7 years I believe. But until recently when I found everything was out of control, I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with depression.

For the last few years, my depression has been a come and go thing. Sometimes I feel completely normal. While sometimes I feel like the end of the world and stuff like that. My doctor said my condition is fixable. I have been on meds for the last 5 months. Things looked better. Until recently ...

I got disrespected by my wife. She has been acting disrespectful, insulting me and sometimes my family. She even used violence on me. I asked her sometimes if she believed in mental health, which she said yes. But what I don't understand is she treating me like that, hoping I can be fixed. She said like I mean nothing in her life. Does that sound she really believe and understand my mental health? 

She won't let me breathe. She kept yelling and insulting me, telling me to get better (?). While I find my condition is not that terrible and I really made some progress, but, everytime she does that to me, I feel like I had to start from the beginning. I had to clear my mind and start saving myself again. That thought came to me more and more frequently. I can do nothing but telling myself that I must live, not only for me, but also for people I care about, including her of course. I wish she knew this.

She says I don’t enjoy doing things with her any more, and even though I still do some of those things, she can tell I’m not really present or that I'm not enjoying it. Hearing this was hard, but I think she’s right. She mentioned feeling like we’re living more as roommates than partners. I feel the same way.

When I’m down, I retreat to our home office – my own “room,” similar to how I used to escape to my room growing up. It’s my way of coping after a long or stressful day. But she wants more connection, more fun and shared experiences. She wonders what the point of us being together is if we don’t have things we like doing together, which I entirely understand.

I'm a people pleaser, it's part of why I'm depressed. I told her that I’m working on prioritizing my needs for the first time. But I don't think I'm doing that good enough because she said she feels pushed aside. She’s expressed that she’s proud of what she’s doing with her life, but sad that she has to do it alone. She’s going abroad for two months soon, and she told me in tears she isn’t sure she’ll miss me, since we’re so disconnected already.

I know she fell in love with a version of me who was excited about life and ready to explore it with her. But now, I’m not sure if I was ever really that person or if I just went along with her dreams because I was putting her needs first.

I know it won’t if I don’t do something, so please don’t write anything like ‘just ask for help already’ or ‘it gets better’. If you don’t have anything good to say, please don’t say anything, and don’t try to convince people to do things they don’t want to or just can’t do or give them positive comments that are obviously impossible to achieve now. And this doesn’t only go for me, most people on here feel the same way, so just be careful with what you say and please give actual good advice.

Sorry for using your time, I just really need somebody. Thank you.

Please be kind.",2024-11-10 16:03:42

It helped me to stay alive by providing me food and water. Other than that it just made me sink more into my belief that I don't have any agency over myself and my life. In the hospital we have one theraphy session per week and inbetween some group therapy that is psychoeducation. My therapist mainly works with CBT and she also gave me homework, which I don't do because I believe that it's pointless and won't help me. I don't know what's wrong with me but I felt so uncomfortable in the hospital most of the time. Initially when I came to seek help it was because I was on the brink of ending my own life. I didn't eat or drink only slept. And I think I wanted someone to save me, to make me better. But what I came to realize is that there is no one coming to save me. They can provide help but in the end I have to be the one to be avtive and change my behaviour, especially escaping everything by laying around in bed. I know what to do but I always choose to stay the same.... It's like I don't realize that I have the power to change and it's engraved in me so deeply. And now I feel like the time I spent here was not beneficial, because of my inaction. Missing therapies like sports and stuff. I'm about to leave the hospital soon and although I don't feel ready I guess I'll just go back to my everyday life and study. I guess no matter how hard it's going to be I have to face it and change my behaviour. Anyone had same experiences?",2024-11-10 15:54:20

I'm 22 and I've just finished my degree (which was a struggle), and now I'm back home, where I have no friends, all around me are fields, there's nothing here except my family. My hobbies don't bring me the joy I once had, and my academic life was the only validation I had. I can only feel this getting worse, I am losing motivation to do anything. I play my guitar for hours on end because its the only distraction that works for me. I am coming to terms with the fact that life will never be as I imagined my life was as capable of being, but its hard, and I'm alone, with no value.

My cat has been poorly this year which has been stressful and I haven’t coped with it very well.
He is luckily slowly getting better.

My coworker has been away on maternity leave and has just come back. I am dreading working with her again. She acts as if work is her personal therapy session. All the conversations I have with her are dark and depressing. She talks about her and her husband struggling for money, her stepchildren being a nightmare and her childhood where she talks openly about sexual abuse. 
I’ve only worked with her for 1 day so far and within 10 minutes of being in the office she started saying her and her husband had an argument and she had a really bad night. I try to change the conversations to something lighthearted but she always brings up something bad. 
I just can’t cope with listening to her problems when I am struggling to get through the day myself.

depression,1go21g5,They'll miss me once I die,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go21g5/theyll_miss_me_once_i_die/,0,"Hello, I am a 14 years old Asian girl. My parents have belittled my thoughts of committing suicide. They have discovered my texts with my cousin about me taking multiple pills at once trying to kill myself, I told them it was a joke and I didn't actually do it even tho its true. I have  become afraid and terrified to open up to my parents or even anyone because of their words. They have told me I was 'weak' for crying, for thinking of suicidal thoughts. They ask how I am thinking of suicide when I have a roof over my head, food, items, allowance, but those physical aspects doesn't help my mental health, it becomes worse if they compare me to my niece or other relatives.

I myself don't know if I have depression, I've been confused of what I am truly feeling, of what do I truly want. I had a dream of becoming a Doctor since I was young, but my parents have told me I was stupid and dumb, and if I'm going to be a Doctor I shouldn't waste their money on a course I'll probably fail in the future. I have always thought I am smart because of my grades so it kept me going, kept me wanting to complete my dreams but the words they always tell me discourages me through and through.   
  
And my mother has always used the physical discipline type, but sometimes I think her 'lessons' are too painful. Because of her I can't tell between abuse and discipline anymore. Just a week ago she punched me and my head slammed into a wall, it really hurts, it really did. She has been 'disciplining' me since i was 9 or 10, I can't even remember because I have such bad memory. 

I know that me myself is not the best daughter. I'm lazy, incompetent, and pathetic and is only useful in school. I know that I'm much closer to my friends than them. They wonder I don't like talking to them or speaking out my problems, but when I do they get angry at me, I don't even know why they are angry at me. I've become such a meek person that I tend to tear up at the slightest raise of voice, I apologize for just by counting my payment Infront of the cashier, my brain just automatically makes me say sorry over and over again to the them.

  
I don't even know whether I'm making till 18 before I just jump off the senior high school building. I don't even know whether they truly love me or just want to make use out of me. ",2024-11-10 14:38:10

He's ""ruined"" a fantasy I had about committing suicide where I slice my wrist open and go to bed, I fall asleep while bleeding out and can finally rest. I found solace in that thought, as messed up as that is. After I got him that dream now ends with him crawling into bed next to me, then this innocent creature is alone. That's the thought that disgusts me, my neighbours thinking something's wrong or my family coming to check on me and finding my body doesn't.

I know that's fucked up but I'm worried my family has already written me off, they love me but they're expecting me to die young. They know I'm miserable at work, my friendships have degraded and I'm tragically single. Death is fresh on our minds right now since my grandfather just died and while discussing his ashes I mentioned jokingly that I want mine thrown into someone's face and my mother said she wouldn't be do that, she let it slip that she thinks she'll outlive me. My sister outright said the other day when I mentioned my dog is the only thing keeping me alive that she'd feel sad but she thinks I'm one bad day from drunkenly going over my balcony, the catio I have set up from my previous cat is now a suicide prevention device. The cat died this year too so that's fresh in the brain. 

I think my dogs presence in my life, that little piece of hope around the toxicity I've grown used to has helped me realise I need to do something. Tbh I don't think I'm any less suicidal but I'm upset by the fact I am now.

depression,1go1lr3,We're thinking about it all wrong for the right reasons...,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go1lr3/were_thinking_about_it_all_wrong_for_the_right/,0,"Let's just be real right now... You know what I really think... I've seen more realness and vulnerability in people who are experiencing Mental Health and Depression... When I see people express the difficulty of life I feel more connection than I do with someone who boasts about success and achievements.

I think people who experience Mental Health and Depression have found something that doesn't get noticed because of the structured, conditioned world.

If you have been broken, the rug of life pulled out from underneath you, or you feel like you cannot find a harmony between yourself and the rest of the world... Then you know what I'm talking about.

...You know people are insane? Really... They are.

The highest valued thing on this planet is not money... The most praised thing is actually the greatest distraction, the greatest manipulation... The greatest avoidance, the greatest deniability... The more money you have the more of this you can ""buy"".

To feel raw and vulnerable, alienated... And then for people to have the audacity to deal with Mental Health and Depression by finding ways to bring someone back into conformity / compatibility...  ""Solutions"" from the minds of the insane! An insane world denying its own Insanity and pretending it's where people with Mental Health and Depression aught to get back to...

A YouTuber is a person that needs people to watch them. They need people to watch them so that they can generate revenue via ads and sponsors... A YouTuber knows the more views they get, the more money they can make, and with the more money they have the more distractions (content) they can create. In order to get more views, strategically a YouTuber will generate content that is more trendy, more outrageous, dramatic, cringe worthy, quick cuts, sound effects, imagery, even bringing the audience in by making them feel valued and important by requesting they share their opinion in the comments below... And all these techniques are forms of manipulative tactics... They all have their reasons for attracting peoples attention and playing on their emotions, stimulation, dopamine kicks...

And... the ones who are experiencing ""Mental Health"" and ""Depression"" are the ones who have something wrong with them???

Do you see where I'm coming from?

How to apply for a Job: study, get some sort of certification that you have attained the right programming for the role.. write a resume where you do whatever you can to create a sense of conviction that you are the right person for the job... Plus competing with other people doing the exact same thing, so throw in a few white lies while you're at it to get ahead of the competition... Go for the interview and show them that you are indeed the physical representation of the written resume and papers of qualifications... When you leave the room, drop that act because it's so exhausting and taxing to uphold something so unnatural... But not for long because if you do get the job, you'll be putting that act back on 5 days a week... So get used to it...

And... The ones who are experiencing ""Mental Health"" and ""Depression"" are the ones who have something wrong with them???

It's someone's birthday... a wedding...a Celebration etc... now... With that hard earned money, make sure you've put enough aside so that you can buy gifts and make an impression that maintains a certain reputation, and do all this during your time away from work... Don't forget to drink alcohol to relieve the nerves and tension and stress because you're in competition to not be socially awkward and blend in and... Have a good time!

It's not that these things are ""bad""... I'm just saying...

...And... The ones who are experiencing ""Mental Health"" and ""Depression"" are the ones who have something wrong with them???

Mental Health and Depression are warning signals, fail safes... That the system is wrong, the world is wrong... They are not signs that there is something wrong with you...

With Mental Health and Depression you can feel cornered, suicidal, no way forward, isolated.... The Symptoms are representations of a world gone wrong...

And maybe this whole time we've been thinking how do we ""fix"" or ""heal"" mental health and depression? And the words ""fix"" and ""heal"" are really just ways of saying... How do we get this person to conform, to be cohesive, to fit into this insane world... And this is coming from those who have not yet experience it for themselves... 

Maybe it's time for the rest of the world to ""unfix"" and ""unheal""... Maybe it's time for the rest of the world to see that ""Mental Health"" and ""Depression"" are labels that are in direct associations and correlations to their insane world... Maybe there hasn't been a person yet, who has truly invited in this ""mental health"" and ""depression""... I'm not saying inviting those labels in... I'm saying... Inviting in the realness, the vulnerabilities of these raw experiences... 

An insane world will call it mental health, that's part of the insanity. An insane world will call it depression, that's part of the insanity. Insane people who haven't experienced it for themselves only know manipulation and distraction and denial and avoidance... And these are the people giving it those labels... No wonder they are the labels they are...

Who the fuck knows? Maybe aliens or other entities with different means of cognition and ""intelligence"" would look at this planet, and YouTubers, and job processes... And ""businesses"", and just how these humans ""do things""... And maybe they would go... This planet is a goddamn mental institution - look at these denial readings they've gone off the charts! Totally oblivious... But hey... Wait a minute.... Look at these other humans... They're different... They seem to oppose the way everyone else does stuff... It's like they can see it... 

The world's insane... Mental health and depression are terms created by the insane so that they can keep their insanity going.

Also, I'm not disregarding the extreme difficulty of the stuff we go through, I'm not saying it's not real the stuff we go through, not at all... I'm just saying... Take an honest look at who's calling it depression and mental health...

If you have been to the deepest pit of despair... And you had the opportunity to call mental health and depression something else, what would you call it? Someone who's been there... What is it really? Because if there is more vulnerability, more realness, more sincerity that comes out of it... What is it really?",2024-11-10 14:16:43

lately i feel like my life is going no where. i'm having a hard time moving on. i have so much trauma, i'm a victim of CSA and was SA'd when i was 16. that has contributed to a lot of my trauma. i come from a country where i didn't have a lot of childhood growing up because of poverty. i had undiagnosed autism all throughout elementary school and was bullied for the way i was. this year, my best friend cut me off and my boyfriend broke up with me.

my boyfriend was one of the things keeping me going. i was in an abusive relationship before him where i was exploited sexually and when we started dating, he was a fresh breath of air. he was the first to treat me with genuine love and kindness. 

he broke up with me suddenly without any signs of a potential breakup and it was the the straw that broke the camel's back. i tried to take my own life twice after our breakup.

the second time, i was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 1 week. i was diagnosed with OCD there and given over the max of my medication (cipralex). i've been out of the hospital for 2 weeks now. i'm really struggling. everyday i just want to take my life but i truly can't. i have a dog to live for and my medication stops me from actually doing anything.

i've been spending everyday in and out of it. i disassociate a lot. idk what i'm doing with myself. i try to occupy myself with my hobbies but it doesn't stop my intrusive thoughts. i'm so desperate for my boyfriend to come back that i paid a witch to perform a spell for me. i am truly desperate and struggling.

i'm 19 and have no friends. my only friends are my online friends, but i long for a group of friends that i can just hang out with. i cut off my college friends from first year because they were not good people. now i am afraid to make friends. i'm extroverted but i feel like there's just no point anymore.

i wish i wasn't struggling at this young age. i really don't know what will happen to me in the future",2024-11-10 13:57:20

I tried hard, followed the rules blah blah blah and have never felt worse or been in a worse position - and, yes it is going to get worse, and yes I've tried to get help for the past 16 years.



This year I decided to give up, and have been 'bed rotting' since January 1st.

If someone asks, ""How are you?"" and I tell them, honestly and bluntly, ""Don't bother asking."" Nothing good. No one wants to listen to weekly updates on how my life is crumbling before my eyes.

2025 will be worse.

I'm going to lose my home, the only constant in my life, it's shitty and falling apart and it is all I have.

There is no backup. No support-system.



I think it's ok to want to die, it's scary as well, only because I don't know what comes next. It might be worse, but it could be better.

But I know this life isn't getting better.

I have **given up**, and I refuse to spend the next 30, 40, 50 years living a life that is not good and will not get better.

Then she kept saying things like, “Stop being sad, just come with me to my sports practice. Don’t be so sad, blah blah blah.”

I know she would love to help me, but I also believe that there should be some boundaries in a romantic relationship. She is not my therapist and I don't want her to be.

I want her to remain romantically and sexually attracted to me and not view me as someone that she has to emotionally/mentally support, as this is draining even if her love is strong enough to do it.

I have had severe body dysmorphia since I was about 15 or 16. I've allowed it to control me throughout my 20s and now at 33 father time is adding aging onto my already negative self-image.

Seeing photos of myself puts me into a depressive funk for 1 to 2 days, unless it's a particularly good photo. 

I never deny taking photos with her because I don't want my mental issues to affect our relationship and she deserves to have a partner who will capture memories in this way. 

I've told her about my BDD, but she doesn't understand the extent of it. If I didn't have my own family or her, my fear is that I will end up like my uncle (not here anymore).

I would say this funk happens maybe once or twice a month. The majority of the time I cope well, but it is just that, coping. There is always a sense of pain beneath the surface, that I cannot fully enjoy life because I'm so self-absorbed due to this OCD bullshit. 

We are talking about having a family together and I would love to have kids and not be an old dad. I also want my parents to see grandchildren. I don't want to pass on any of my mental issues to them. 

I want to fix my appearance so bad, but I could use this money for a place to live and have a future. 

Do I ""fix"" myself (which may or may not work), or carry the burden for the rest of my life and just accept that my own sense of wellbeing is a write-off for the sake of my family and future kids.

Why does the child murderer’s choice to murder override the child’s right to life? Because it seems these fundamental 'God-given rights' are not actually rights at all, at least not on earth.  

'But they will be punished.' The problem is the damage is already done. Even if the perpetrators burn in hell, that doesn’t un-rape the woman, nor does it un-murder the child. Also, if God is omniscient, everything is predetermined anyway, so it’s not even up to us. If you had a crystal ball and saw that little Billy would grow up to become a serial killer, you wouldn’t willingly place him on earth. Even if there are 'multiple timelines,' it still wouldn’t be in humanity's best interest to let the bad one play out—I don’t care about any bullshit butterfly effect theory.  

There’s literally no scenario where the suffering of innocents is ever justified, period. If you told me an innocent child had to be sacrificed in the name of 'saving the world,' I would not agree to the sacrifice.  

And is all of this gratuitous evil simply a byproduct of some stupid fuckers eating an apple when God told them not to? For the most powerful deity in existence, that’s quite a hill to die on.  

'But God is beyond our weak human comprehension.' Okay, if that’s the case, then it’s not appropriate for us to assign any characteristics to him whatsoever. I’m still yet to see a convincing argument on the Christian side—just constant bullshit semantics that fail to acknowledge the existence of gratuitous evil.

I've had Corona many times, usually for 5 days and then I was fit again.

I've been a non-smoker for almost 10 months. The withdrawal was also marked by depression, but I was able to overcome it easily.

I never drink alcohol, and I've been doing that for 10 years.

I eat healthily.

I haven't had any social media for over a year (only Reddit), everything else has been deleted. I've also been in therapy for 2 1/2 years.

I've had Corona for 2 weeks now, with really strong symptoms (chest pain, breathlessness, etc.) and I've been suffering from severe depression for 3 days (+ my period)

I have to cry uncontrollably, just like that? (I've never had that before) - I feel totally powerless, like I'm in a bubble and I don't feel real. Somehow I'm no longer interested in anything and I'm just rotting in my bed. Everything is super exhausting and the thought of having to go back to work soon makes me panic. I am extremely sensitive to noise, sleep badly (wake up 10 times) and am really a little ""devastated""
I am triggered by old things and think about events and people that I haven't thought about in the last few years.

I can't work in this state and I feel really bad...

Does anyone have an idea? I haven't felt this bad since puberty. And I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but all my strategies aren't helping at the moment.

+ Is it possible that I am caught in a trauma film? Because yesterday when I was crying, a lot, my alarm went off for work in the evening (night shift) even though I am currently on sick leave, and the alarm ""disturbed"" me a little

I'm also very lonely currently, I don't have many friends but when I try making new friends I hate them. I hate people.

I genuinely don't know what's going on I just wanna stop feeling so dreadful all the time. People never know me as a sad person because I always try to keep the people around me happy, I don't want to see anyone down because I'm down.

Im sure they all mourn the person they think I replaced. And they blame me for taking that person away, regardless of the fact that person never really existed anyways.

But this year has been a massive downward spiral, which left me feeling like my brain is completely fried and unable to ever operate somehow normally.  
I am 29, and was i a loving relationship. After multiple terrible relationship experiences in my past, this was my first which felt safe, healthy, and supporting. Talked about marriage.   
Last year, we both made a decision to quit our jobs, pursue new career and he would move in with me in the city where i lived.  
Long story short, he succeeded, found a job immediately, moved in with me.  
I on the other hand, I went through a year full of failiures, rejection, and loneliness. Hundreds  and hundreds of rejection emails from jobs, lost friendship, lost all my money, and also lost a friend in a tragic death.  
My partner was happy in a new city, I was broken but still fighting every day to secure some job and keep going.   
I am a musician, so I tried to at least practice and record for my album during the days.  
However, than one day, my partner blindsided me. Broke up with me, telling that he wants to explore different things and I am just sad all the time. I broke down, moved in with my parents, but still continued looking for a job. Couple weeks later, he came back, we got back together, promised we will go to therapy. I believed, he left a week later, again.  
This whole whirlwind made me so depressed, confused, and anxious about everything. My family and friends are trying their best to help me, but its just not enough. I dont like music anymore, dont know where I want to live, dont know what to do next.

depression,1gnwgyk,struggling at 17,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gnwgyk/struggling_at_17/,0,"

 I'm a 17 year old girl. I was diagnosed with depression last year. Psychiatrists said I've been in a depressive state since I was 13 and have symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder because I went through a lot of stuff in my childhood and teenage years. 

I went to therapy for a year but left in the summer of 2024 because it never helped and only made things worse for me. The phychiatrists were condescending and downright mean sometimes. And I had to force myself to take all kinds of tests for medication that never worked. I'm scared to death of blood tests, because when I was 12, due to physical health problems, I had to have one every 15 days and I couldn't take it anymore. It always hurts so much doctors said I have ""small veins"", and the last time I had blood drawn it hurt so much I screamed out loud.
All of these sacrifices for a therapy that resulted in the psychiatrist telling me I wasted a year. When I was desperately trying to survive.


I had to quit highschool when I started therapy. Its either school or therapy nobodys gonna wait for me to get better. So when I got out of therapy a few months ago I took online classes. I thought I could make it, but my situation at home makes me feel even worse, and my mental health is slipping. I'm relapsing in everything. And just yesterday I had to beg my mother not to shout at me, but she wouldn't listen. So I ended up curled up in my bed, ears ringing, sobbing and choking on my own saliva because I couldn't breathe. Since then, I've barely had the energy to get out of bed, and I have to force myself to eat something at least once a day. And I'm hallucinating my best friend from middle school who had committed suicide.


I'd feel so much better if I could still study, but I can't study any more, I feel stupid because firstly I don't want to seek help from professionals either, but it's physically impossible for me to force myself to study again. But I HAVE to graduate highschool - I won't be able to find a job if I don't. So I'm stuck. I know you're not health professionals, but I can't talk to one either, given what happened the last time I did. And even if I tried, I wouldn't be able to explain my traumas or what's going on in my head anymore, it's all a blur and I don't even have the energy. I tried speaking to a crisis line but I instantly gave up because I started feeling so stressed I threw up.


 And I can't ask my parents for help because my father doesn't think I'm ill at all, says I'm making up things.
And my mother says she has problems too and that she's the one who should be depressed and that I should understand her...in short, everything is complicated and I'm really stuck, I don't know what to do and I feel really stupid and pathetic. If I could still study, it would give me hope, but I can't even do that anymore, so clearly I'm screwed.

depression,1gnwbb8,Social Isolation ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gnwbb8/social_isolation/,1,"I'm posting this because I don't know what else to do. 

I'm nearly 29 years old and I can't connect with other people to (literally) save my life. I'm awkward in a way that makes everyone I talk to uncomfortable. I don't have any redeeming qualities. I'm boring, kind of stupid, and I can't stick to a hobby long enough to develop any interesting skills. 

Whenever I try and talk to someone or tell a story I can see it in people's eyes and body language that they're just waiting for me to stop talking. I don't have friends, I can't follow through and finish my degree, I work an entry level job making $21/hr and I can't afford to move out of my parent's house - I'm losing any hope I have for the future. I've seen a therapist every week for 10 years and I have taken every antidepressant and ADHD medication they make. I'm currently taking Mirtazapine for depression and if you can believe it this is actually a huge improvement from what it's been like in the past. 

I'm growing magic mushrooms as a last resort but I don't have anyone that can trip sit me or even anywhere I can go to do them. I've never been a heavy drinker but I've been drinking myself to sleep for the past few weeks. I can't stop thinking about dying and how much of a weight off my shoulders it would be. Please, if there's anyone out there that can help me hope for anything in the future I would really appreciate it. Is there any way I can ever have anything resembling a social life?",2024-11-10 08:39:57

depression,1gnskgd,Should I Let Go of the Idea,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gnskgd/should_i_let_go_of_the_idea/,2,"Hello all. 

I am in my thirties & have been single post divorce for about 9 years now. I have nothing bad to say about my ex-husband. We were way too young at the time to be married (age 20) & lacked the capacity to grow together. 

The last date that I went on was about 6 years ago. I just don't have the time nor energy to waste in case something doesn't work out.

Well, as of late I've been thinking of the possibility of remarrying again one day. Thinking back to being married at 20, I was struggling with depression then, I just didn't know. 

Fast forward to now, I've been in therapy for years now but I still struggle with depression and bipolar 2. It's been easier for me to be alone because sometimes I think who would want to deal with someone moody, withdrawn at times, introverted, sad, & depressed most of the time? And my endometriosis diagnosis doesn't help either. 

I want to know do you think it's reasonable for me to consider the idea of a relationship even with all of my flaws? Yes, I know everyone has flaws, but mental issues is in a whole other category by itself. ",2024-11-10 04:27:57

depression,1gnvbxj,"Is depression just, ideological cancer?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gnvbxj/is_depression_just_ideological_cancer/,0,"Stupid question maybe, or maybe some has already asked and been answered, but I was reading this discussion on how ""a cure for cancer"" isn't possible, because cancer isn't one disease... It's a whole category...
And I started thinking about how a cancer is basically a bunch of cells which replicate without control and then I couldn't stop noticing the similarities....


Like, a cancer will grow to occupy space without performing the function of the cells it replaces...
Just like depressive thoughts will occupy headspace without being very useful.


Or how cancer cells take up nutrients and starve healthy cell, just like depressive thoughts take up your thinking time and emotional capacity, until you're basically empty for everything else.

Or how cancer cells can produce certain homes in abnormal quantities, like how we can fixated of self-depracating ideas that poison every other positive notion...

Or how cancers eventually turn terminal, just like depression can lead into suicidal tendencies.

Am I overthinking this? 
Am I wrong or missing something?
Please tell me I don't have cancer.",2024-11-10 07:27:36

I'm married with a 7 old daughter and 2 dogs that are age 12 and 14. I am miserable. I would be miserable even if I didn't have to take care of all of them. I hate life. Existing is painful. And I've only made it harder by choosing to add things to it. I do everything I can to avoid living. I go to sleep at 8pm until 8am. I only do what I have to while I'm awake. I hold my pee until I absolutely can't. I wait to eat until I'm very hungry. I get up to take my dogs out and feed my daughter. My husband is getting very tired of me never wanting to do anything. And angry. He says he knows I can't help it but it is still upsetting, which I think is very honest of him. My daughter wants to play. She is so sweet and kind. Occasionally, I muster a game of charades, color, or play restaurant. My dogs love me. They lay beside me all day. It is exhausting just to exist. I work with a psychiatrist and take meds. They aren't working. We keep trying new meds and different combinations.  I don't want to kill myself but my god if I just didn't wake up that would be a literal dream. Nothing is working. Everyday is miserable. I feel bad for being like this. It makes me cry. Idk how much longer I can do this and idk what else to do. I am desperately searching for something to make life less painful.
