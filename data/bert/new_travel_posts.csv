travel,1gplkw9,Machu Picchu via one-day Inka Trail,1755,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gplkw9,89,"Many people want a taste of the Inka Trail, but may not have time or physical conditioning to do the entire four day trek (or maybe the want a shower).  There is fortunately another option!  The one day inka trail.  Since I just completed it, I thought I would share some insights. 

1) the Inka trail is highly controlled for number of people.  You *will* need to book in advance.  You will need a guide/group to go.  And you have to have the passport you booked with because the checkpoints verify your access using that number (if you update your passport before travel, bring your old passport or work with your guide/travel agent to update your booking to your current passport number)

2) Out of 7 miles, you will only be on *the* inca trail for the last ~3 miles.  The four day trail and the one day meet up just past the ruins of Winay Wayna.  You will still pass through the sun gate for that first magical view of Machu Picchu 

3) yes, the trail is only 7 miles and caps out at ""only"" 8,500 feet.  That makes it worlds easier than the 4-day trek.  But this is NOT an easy hike.  The first three and a half hours are just up up up through hot and humid jungle.  After passing the waterfall, Winay Wayna is the hardest part of the first half, with the ruin involving ~330 steep, uneven steps.  After this is the lunch spot, the only bathroom, and the campsite.  The second half is easier, gentler ups and downs, with only the ""monkey steps"" being the hardest challenge.  These are 50 high stairs that are so steep most people use their hands to climb too.  Finally, the sun gate isn't the end, you still have 45 - 60 minutes down to Machu Picchu and the busses down

4) there is no drinkable water on this trail.  You will need to carry two liters of water, a Gatorade, snacks, a packed lunch, sunblock, bug repellent, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rain gear, a hat, and sunglasses.  ",2024-11-12 14:10:59
travel,1gpvrhb,Unique experience : I climbed the motherland statue in Kyiv ,266,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gpvrhb,28,"I had the opportunity to be in Kyiv this summer for professional reasons. When I went to the Motherland statue to visit the WW2 museum, the lady at the counter proposed me to climb up to the shield.

Apparently they resumed doing that since February of 2024 and just a few lucky ones have the occasion to do that per day. I was alone and accompanied by a single guide, passing by old soviet elevator up to the neck

Once there I was geared up with protection harness and had to climb a ladder through the left hand. At the end you arrive at a very small plateform located behind the shield, I give you some pictures so you can see the view yourself!

To be able to do it you need to arrive pretty early and also be able to climb ladder, I think the guide will take the decisions if you can do it or not",2024-11-12 21:17:13

We rented a car during a trip to Italy September 2023. We returned the vehicle and that was that. Out of nowhere I receive this collections mail from a US based company with a photocopy of an original letter I never received from the Italian rental company saying I entered some forbidden or unauthorized location and so I owed ~100 euros. 

Because I never received the said letter and time passed, it somehow went up by 5x, got acquired by this collection agency and now I’m getting harassed. I got on the phone with the agency and asked about proof / evidence was told by some overseas phone person I’d be emailed and never received anything. I continue to receive emails from this agency now saying I have all the proof (i don’t). 

I’m at a total loss. $500 is no small change. I don’t even know what my legal rights are or how I make this go away. I’m super nervous this is going to hit my credit score somehow.

I’ve been living in Canada for coming up on 2 years, and have always dreamt of visiting the Pacific Rim National Park. After a little planning, my dream came true in late September and I got to explore some of the beaches, forests and mountains that this simply stunning park has to offer.

The town and the park as a whole was well worth a visit, in the off season the crowds were minimal and most of the trails we visited were sparsely populated.

travel,1gq98a3,West Canada by RV,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gq98a3/west_canada_by_rv/,2,"Hi, I hope I can ask some advice here about traveling by RV in West Canada, more specifically the breakup of the itinerary in legs.

My family and I (5 in total) want to travel next summer from Vancouver, over Vancouver Island to Calgary. Flights are booked. 2 nights in Vancouver are booked. RV is booked. So now we are detailing the itinerary. We travel from Europe and have about 25 days in the area. Given the party size, it's a once in a lifetime trip before the kids will leave the nest.

We mostly like nature, hiking, some local culture, and some fun activity along the way. During transits, we like to stop left or right to do some sightseeing or visiting a point of interest.

Below, I give what I already have as a plan, but I would like to hear some **(experience based) opinions on the length of stays at different places**. More specifically, I currently am hesitating between having some 1-night stops with shorter distances in between (see line 10-11-12), or longer (2-3 night) stops with greater distances, but then not having the need to relocate each day. However, my feeling is that by traveling by RV, you want to keep moving, otherwise we could have just booked lodges or hotels and a car.

Some options in the row 10-13 are:

* 1 night whistler, 1 night kamloops, 2 nights wells gray
* 1 night whistler, 3 nights wells gray
* 2 night whistler, 2 nights wells gray
* 1 night whistler, 2 nights wells gray (with one additional night somewhere down the table)

Currently, the time for Jasper/Icefield Pkwy is fairly limited but we would like to take our time in Yoho/Glacier/Revelstoke parks as well, so we have to choose somewhere. Is this a bad idea?

Also, if there are strongly **recommended First Nation visitor centres/acitivities**, please let me know.

It was a great way to see a lot of spectacular natural locations, in company with other fans of the books and movies.

Five years ago, we did a Smithsonian Tour that had an emphasis on learning about castles in Scotland.  That was good, but nowhere near the fabulousness of the NZ tour.

We want to find another tour like the NZ one, but searching for such a thing is not turning up any strong leads.  I've searched for geek/nerd tours, tours for a few other movies/books we like, and so on, but no luck.

The things that made the NZ tour especially good were:  
\- everyone on the tour was very interested in the books and locations.  The Scotland tour had a number of people who didn't seem all that invested in it.  
\- the tour guides were locals, really knew their material, and were longtime fans of the books/movies (Scotland tour had two local professors, and two Smithsonian guides not from the area.)  
\- as a result of the first two, we (two geeky and introverted people) felt we were not amongst strangers, even though the other attendees were from all over the world.  
\- the itinerary was a good mix of impressive sites/sights, side adventures (like a helicopter landing high up in a mountain range that was one movie site, and another that was a Maori cultural evening), time spent with NZ craftspeople that were involved in the films (landowners/extras, calligrapher, jeweler, WETA) and time in cities and towns. We felt we had a decent overview of NZ as a country, not just as a movie set.

So you see, these things are kind of unusual, and I don't know how to find something similar -- assuming something similar even exists.  It wouldn't need to be a tour focused on a movie or book.. or author, if it had these characteristics. I don't know if there are industry terms for any of this that I could use for a keyword search.  I'm hoping people will have some ideas.

And, because I'm sure it will come up: yes, we want a guided/organized tour.  We also go abroad on our own, but one of us has a day job essentially herding cats, and to NOT be the one in charge is a true vacation.",2024-11-13 03:59:48

travel,1gq0cb5,Is this budget/itinerary for Mexico and Central America absolutely mad?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gq0cb5/is_this_budgetitinerary_for_mexico_and_central/,27,"Hello Everyone!

I am leaving Canada in January 2025 to explore Mexico and Central America. Below will be a rough itinerary for context, but I am struggling with a budget. I have about $14000 CAD ($10000 USD) saved. This is excluding flights, but will need to include all accommodation, food, transportation, and tours.

**Mexico - Approx. 1 month**

* Mexico City - 1 week
* Puebla- 2 nights
* Oaxaca - 1 week
* Puerto Escondido - 1 week
* San Jose Del Pacifico - 2 nights
* Salina Cruz - 1 night
* San Cristobal - 4 nights
* Palenque - 2 nights
* Merida - 4 nights

**Belize -**

* Caye Caulker - 5 nights
* San Ignacio - 2 nights

**Guatemala - 2-3 weeks**

* Flores - 3 nights
* Stop in Tikal
* Lanquin - 5 nights 
* Lake Atitlan - 5 nights
* Antigua - 5 nights 

**Honduras (to see the ruins)??**

* Copan - 2 nights

**El Salvador - 1 week**

* Santa Ana - 4 nights
* Playa El Tunco - 4 nights

**Nicaragua - 1.5 - 2 weeks**

* Leon - 4 nights
* Granada - 4 nights
* Isla De Ometepe - 3 nights 
* San Juan Del Sur - 2 nights

**Costa Rica - 1 week (I am really needing help with this)** 

* Monteverde - 2 nights
* La Fortuna - 2 nights 
* Manuel Antonio - 2 nights
* Puerto Viejo de Talamanca - 2 nights 

**Panama - 2 weeks**

* Bocas del Toro - 3 nights
* Hornito - 3 nights
* Panama City - 1 night?
* San Blas Islands - 3 nights
* Panama City - 3 nights?

Fly Home

I am hoping to spend roughly $100 CAD ($72 USD) a day. Here is a breakdown:

$25 CAD ($18 USD) for accommodation per day, staying in hostel dorms 

$50 CAD ($35 USD) for food, a combination of street food, restaurants, hostel breakfast & cooking

$15 CAD ($11 USD) for transportation - this seems low with all of the bus travel.

Alcohol may take up the remainder of budget, as I do like the occasional party. 

I do not have tours included in this mess of a budget, as I know each country will fluctuate in cost. This is where any input and advice from you will be helpful.

Am I absolutely crazy for thinking this is feasible? Please let me hear your experiences!",2024-11-13 00:40:44

Not sure if we should go or not? Looking to see if someone recently went and what their experience was and also can you see it all in one day, like if we left Belize drove into Guatemala did the Tikal tour and then drove back into Belize all during day light hours.

Which will be mostly Dublin and parts of both Republic and N Ireland, parts of Scotland close to or in Edinburgh, also York and London.

After that I am planning a Contiki trip around Europe for end of July that is about a month long, but after that I don't know what else I want to do apart from visiting heritage railways, the tattoo festival and just roaming cities. I also plan on getting a youth mobility visa that the UK offers. Budget is in the works but about 5-7g Cdn is the range depending on visas and other expenses before trip. I do have family who live in the UK (mostly in towns north of Edinburgh and some in London), but are second or third cousins and don't want to heavily rely on them. (will stay with them for a few days at most but nothing more than a week).

Looking on advice about groups and stuff to do. I enjoy historical (any era before Cold War, especially early industrial, Victorian, World Wars periods.), cultural, and nature stuff. 

Major countries apart from Ireland and UK I would like to visit are: Portugal Spain Italy, Austria , Hungry, Czechia, Switzerland, Benelux region, Berlin, Germany, major cities in Poland, Scandinavia, France . Balkans are a bit iffy for me at the moment (do want do a Romanian/Moldova or a Greek trip as well as visit Istanbul at some point)

 Also advice on accommodations would be great. Also any idea on finding work over there would be great also ( I am looking on job board and UK government site) I am willing do labour and kitchen work but also looking into transportation and admin/econ sectors. I have a major in Business admin and minor in economics. Also what visas I need for Europe apart from the new one they are introducing next year. 

Also if their are better reddits/blogs for this, send them my way please!

Ps. All of this doesn't have to be one trip, it can be multiple and later in my life. Just want get some ideas of whats possible and whats not. ",2024-11-12 22:45:12

 We are located about 90 minutes from Chicago, but are looking for ideas that we can drive to, preferably a maximum of 8-9 hours or so. Reason I say drive, the plane tickets that week are outrageous even just to Miami. It's sort of a girls trip and then me, which is why it's a bit tougher to figure something out for us. 

Some things we are after:

1. We aren't into skiing or being outside in the cold. 

2.  We dont want to be somewhere that is completely remote, but also prefer not to be surrounded by children due to the holiday break from school. An adults only place would be a plus but not required. 

3. A resort is nice but also maybe some nightlife with people in their 30's.

I looked everywhere, kind of hitting a wall on ideas at this point. The time of year is horrible due to the holidays. I originally wanted Vegas, Miami, Cancun etc, but I am not paying more for this trip than it costs to travel overseas in the spring. ",2024-11-13 01:35:22

travel,1gpnaie,Possible bed bugs while traveling—what to do?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gpnaie/possible_bed_bugs_while_travelingwhat_to_do/,17,"I’m on day four of a three-week international vacation. I stayed two nights in a hotel, and then yesterday, just before boarding a plane to my second destination, I noticed marks on my skin that look like bed bug bites. There are five on my left arm—one pair and one line of three—and then a cluster of three on my left hand. Maybe one more on my right thumb but it’s very faint and hard to be sure. I didn’t see any actual bed bugs, but it hadn’t occurred to me look until it was too late (lesson learned for future hotel stays).

We can debate whether I should’ve boarded the plane at all but we’re past that point and I could really use your advice now. Here’s what I’ve done:

When I landed in my second destination yesterday, I immediately went to a laundromat and washed everything I had that seemed washable, including my backpack itself, and dried it on high heat for 30 minutes. (I have just that one bag, no other luggage.) I threw away the clothes I wore on the flight, and I wiped down and inspected my non-washable stuff like laptop and toiletries as well as I could. Then I went to the apartment of the friend I’m staying with (I explained everything before entering and offered to go to a hotel, but she was okay with me crashing) and put my stuff in trash bags. 

This morning I went to another laundromat  and washed and dried everything again. I also called the hotel, sent them pictures of my bites, and asked them to inspect the room. And that brings me to this moment, sitting in a kebab restaurant, trying to figure out my next move.

1. If these are indeed bed bug bites, how likely do you think it is that I picked up bed bugs from the hotel room? I mostly kept my belongings off the bed, though the room was small and I did put my shoes and dirty clothes on the floor.

2. How long will it take to for me to know if I’m in the clear? I’m planning to fly to my next destination in three days. If I see/feel no more signs of bed bugs in that time, am I likely okay?

3. Knowing all the above, should I cancel the rest of my trip? It would be awful, but less awful than spreading bed bugs to the friends I’m planning to see in the coming weeks. And probably still less awful than having to explain everything and thrust them into the same stress and uncertainty I’m feeling now.",2024-11-12 15:29:04

The winter experience was simply amazing even though it looks less colourful than summer and the upper lake area is closed. The crystal clear water, the piles of snow, the lovely drakes, the frozen waterfalls, sitting on a  boat… There was a magical moment that made my visit even more fascinating — when I was taking photos of a bird on a branch, the bird suddenly flied and landed on my shoulder, as it probably mistook me for a tree!

so my partner is going back to Cuba to visit her family this year, and has invited me to come visit with her. She thought this would be straight forward as she went with her ex a few times many years ago.

However the legalities of traveling to cuba have changed since then, and her ex was not a US citizen.

From reading online it says that tourism is banned (by the US) and you must obtain 1 of 12 visa reasons for flying.

According to some redditors (now i dont want to just assume this is the case) but one of the reasons for visa travel to Cuba is 'helping the cuban people'.

They say as long as you do not give money to the cuban government (i.e. stay in hotels that are operated/owned by the communists) - you are fine.

I read on a few other websites, that there are specific actions you must do when going to Cuba to do this, and the best way is to book with a travel group which has an itenerary that ensures you do specific things that qualify you as 'helping the cuban people'.

These websites specifically say, you cannot go and just sun on the beach for a few days in Cuba if you go on a visa that is to 'help the cuban people'.

My GF is saying that technically i am helping the cuban people, because by flying there i am taking a suitcase full of essentials for her family (who are anti-communists).

But im in a wierd spot - where i cannot get ahold of anyone at the state department to confirm this... and i kinda dont want to just go and do this off the back off a few reddit comments incase i get into some legal grey areas.

so my partner is going back to Cuba to visit her family this year, and has invited me to come visit with her. She thought this would be straight forward as she went with her ex a few times many years ago.

However the legalities of traveling to cuba have changed since then, and her ex was not a US citizen. 

From reading online it says that tourism is banned (by the US) and you must obtain 1 of 12 visa reasons for flying.

According to some redditors (now i dont want to just assume this is the case) but one of the reasons for visa travel to Cuba is 'helping the cuban people'.

They say as long as you do not give money to the cuban government (i.e. stay in hotels that are operated/owned by the communists) - you are fine. 

I read on a few other websites, that there are specific actions you must do when  going to Cuba to do this, and the best way is to book with a travel group which has an itenerary that ensures you do specific things that qualify you as 'helping the cuban people'.

These websites specifically say, you cannot go and just sun on the beach for a few days in Cuba  if you go on a visa that is to 'help the cuban people'. 

My GF is saying that technically i am helping the cuban people, because by flying there i am taking a suitcase full of essentials for her family (who are anti-communists). 

But im in a wierd spot - where i cannot get ahold of anyone at the state department to confirm this... and i kinda dont want to just go and do this off the back off a few reddit comments incase i get into some legal grey areas.

So wondering if anyone has been recently, with the new laws? and if they had any advice.",2024-11-12 21:11:50

I've been feeling the travel bug lately and I'm ready to take my adventures to the next level.

I was born in Brazil, moved to Sweden, and have been fortunate enough to explore quite a few places in Europe, both Western and Eastern. But now, I'm yearning for something more, i have been feeling that Europe has been fairly explored, and would like to take advantage of still being young and having a flexible schedule to have more adventurous trips, without needing to be responsible for family and etc.

As I always wanted to visit Africa, I decided to take a trip to Morocco as a sort of ""warm-up"" for bigger adventures. Renting a car, we drove over 1,000 km, exploring the diverse landscapes and vibrant culture. It was incredible!

However, I've noticed a bit of a challenge when reseatching about Southern Africa: most travel information seems to focus on the most Instagrammable spots. As someone who's not really into social media, I'm looking for more authentic experiences.

So, I'm turning to you, the Reddit community! I'm thinking about Namibia, Tanzania, or Madagascar, but I'm open to any suggestions, nothing is set in stone. 

Where should I go for a truly unforgettable adventure? Any advice, tips, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Basic info: 
- I will be 24 (M)
- I am planning on going in mid April until 2 of May.
- I am not someone who packs a lot of money, but it is also normal a problem, so it would be awesome to be budget friendly

Heading to Japan in winter (february). It's my third trip to Japan, so done the more touristy things already. First part of this upcoming trip will be skiing in Niseko, with some time in Nagano region and finally some days in Tokyo. Itinerary is as follows but got a few questions about these specific things:

\- 5 nights in Niseko

\- 1 night Lake Toya

\- 2 nights Sapporo

\- 1 night Nigata (spending a night there cause we arrive from Sapporo to Nigata airport)

\- 3 nights Matsumoto (day trip to Nagano and maybe day trip to Narai)

\- 4 nights in Tokyo (with posible day trip to Nikko).

Wanted to ask if the time in Sapporo is an ok amount. We won't be doing snow activities (sledding, etc) because we already spent several days skiing by that point, so it would be mostly sightseeing.

The night in Nigata I'm a bit torn about. Not sure if it's worth it to do a stop there or go directly to Matsumoto.

Finally, using Matsumoto as base for exploring Nagano region makes sense? Is it better to stay in Matsumoto vs Nagano?

I've planned a solo, self-driving safari in the Kruger Park in Mid December. I've already booked accommodation inside the park but as the trip was not planned far in advance, I had to book the rest camps based on their availability during my visit and tried to make it as reasonable/doable as possible but while I was double checking the plan, I realized that I might have under estimated the distances between rest camps.

My plan is as follows:

1st night in Skukuza

2nd night in Lower Sabbie

3rd night in Satara

4th night in Letaba

5th night in Tamboti

On check-out day I also need to drop off my rental car in Skukuza Airport and take a flight to Cape Town at 11:40.

My questions are:

1- How long should I expect to travel between each camps? I've checked out the PDF showing distances and times between camps (which is very useful) however it estimates travelling speed at 25km/h. I am planning to drive between camps during lunchtime so my main concern will be to reach the next camp as fast as possible ( I will be doing game drives early in the morning and before sunset/guided night drives). So how long does it take to travel between these camps?

2- If I am not mistaken my longest drive will be from Tamboti to Skukuza Airport and I should be dropping off the rental car latest 10 am to catch my flight, which means I need to be at the airport around 9.30 to complete formalities, fueling up the car etc. So my question is what is the earliest time I can leave Tamboti camp to get to the airport around 9.30?

3- As I will be visiting during wet season, I think there is a high chance of heavy rainfall. How is the driving condition during/after rainfall? Should I expect sand roads to get muddy so much so that it's not possible to drive? This is particularly important on my last drive from Tamboti to Skukuza Airport, getting stuck in the mud and missing the flight would be a terrible experience after having a taste of Eden in the Kruger National Park!

Plus, any and all kind of (even if they are random ones) tips for this self driving safari trip is highly appreciated.

I’m planning a trip to Spain and could use some help fine-tuning my itinerary. This will be my second trip to Spain – on my last visit, I explored Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, and Valencia. This time, I’m hoping to see some new places and dive deeper into Spanish culture.

Arrival: I’ll be landing in Madrid on November 22nd.

Departure: My flight back to the U.S. is from Madrid on December 3rd at 6 AM.

Madrid Game: I’m planning to attend the Real Madrid game on December 1st.


Current Itinerary Ideas:

Here’s the rough plan I have so far:

1. Madrid – 1 day (rest).


2. Seville – 2 or 3 days to explore the culture and main sights.


3. Cordoba – 1 day, mainly for a quick visit to the highlights.


4. Granada – 2 days, primarily to see the Alhambra.

5. Madrid - 3 days rest of the trip.

Questions:

Is this itinerary realistic for 11 days without feeling too rushed?

Would it be worth adding another city or small town to this list, or should I stick with these destinations to fully enjoy them? If so, any recommendations for a smaller town that’s easy to reach from one of these cities?

Transportation Tips: Any recommendations for getting between these cities affordably? I’m considering high-speed trains for the longer stretches.

Prices are about the same, the big difference is when the flight departs and lands.

My girlfriend and I are going to be married in the beginning of August 2025. We are planning our honeymoon a couple of days after the wedding. 

We are unsure which location would suit us best and where august is a great season to visit.  

* We are big foodies and try to explore the local cuisine as much as possible.
* We want to combine nature, city tripping, beaches etc.. Just a nice mix of everything is what we often like.
* We would like the occasional swimming pool or luxury hotel during our trip, but it doesn't have to be for all nights. We rather splurge on some activities and food. 
* We would like to go for 2-3 weeks.
* We prefer to go outside of Europe.

  
Some idea's we already have:

* Indonesia (Affordable luxury, nature, beaches) 
* Tanzania Safari + Zanzibar (Unique experience with safari and beaches but budget concerns and how much of a food scene is there to discover?)
* Peru (No idea about budget,  concerned about not enough sun/too cold to enjoy some beach/swimming pool time, we love nature but are afraid that the heights and a trek to Machu Picchu might be outside of our physical limits. 

  
We don't have a fixed budget yet, we are thinking around 8000€, but less would be better of course. Are there any other good destinations that might fit our budget and interests or what do you think about the places we already thought about?

Background Info:  Active & healthy 60 year-old Americans. Leaning into luxury-tier, but not necessarily f.u. money.

We usually do independent planning ourselves, but looking for guided options & small-party tours this time around. Third-party planning and on-site logistics, start to finish.

We've briefly looked into the usual upmarket tour operators (NatGeo, Tauck, Odysseys Unlimited, etc.), but  their itineraries differ and none appears to hit ALL the top sites... which would be overkill for two weeks anyway.

So Agra is a 100% must, and I think Udaipur, Jodhupur, Jaipur, and Varanasi are too. Should we just stop there? For reference, we're there primarily for the cultural sites and experiences -- not safaris, tiger preserves, or other wildlife adventures.

Over the past few days, my wife and I have been trying to pick the perfect spot for our honeymoon, and we're mainly considering destinations in the Caribbean, Belize, and Costa Rica.

Neither of us has traveled outside the U.S. before, so we're excited but also a bit overwhelmed. My wife is leaning toward an all-inclusive resort with a beautiful beach and good snorkeling, while I’m hoping for some fun excursions but also want a relaxing beach to unwind on. We’re more inclined toward a hotel than an Airbnb, and if we don’t go all-inclusive, we’d need to adjust our budget to cover food costs.

Our total budget is around $5500-$6200.

Our must-haves are:

A nice beach
Good snorkeling
Ziplinea
Great food
Interesting excursions

what kind of business are you running?
No return of the refund even after days and months(source- other Reddit users and reviews on play store,)

It says that you can only modify the ticket 24hr prior flight, but the tickets was not even confirmed before 12hr and how can we expect the return.
no calls, no email response.
is this your customer service?
please feel free to write me up, I shall respond in 6 to 8 business hour.
I will not keep you in wait taking to the robot customer service, (ps: This happened to my friend, not me, but I am a concerned friend, and don't want this happening to other people)
so if you think it is of any concern then do as you say on providing refund within 10 business days
otherwise I think other customers too want their refund

I do a decent amount of churning (lots of Chase points), so domestic US flights are relatively cheap through United, and my city is a Delta/Frontier focus city, so lots of options there too.

Ideally, I'd like to stay fairly budget-friendly of a few hundred bucks, but I'm just itching to go somewhere. I figure cruises may be the best deal when it comes to this, but I'm open to all options. I will be traveling by myself, and I live in SW Ohio for driving options.

We are particularly interested in the Christmas markets, seeing the major sites, hanging out at cafes drinking espresso, and we'd like to see some of the natural beauty of the alps region.

Here's what we have so far:

Day 1-3: Fly into Munich and stay 3 nights.

Day 4: Take a morning train to Innsbruck, day trip to Innsbruck, evening train to Salzburg.

Day 5-6: Salzburg, probably one day in the old city and one day in the lakes region. Take evening train on day 6 to Vienna.

Day 7-9: Vienna, take evening train on day 9 to Nuremberg.

Day 9-11: Nuremberg, take train from Nuremberg to Munich airport.

This is definitely a little more packed than what we usually do. I'm questioning if we need to cut out Innsbruck. Is seeing Innsbruck worth cutting out a day of Salzburg? Is the lakes region of Salzburg worth seeing more than Innsbruck? We like the idea of the morning train from Munich to Innsbruck, as that should be a very scenic ride. But I'm wondering if we are overvaluing Innsbruck entirely.



EDIT: We are decidedly taking out Innsbruck. So it looks more like 3 days in Munich, 3 days in Salzburg / lakes region, 3 days Vienna, 2 days Nuremberg. Any suggestions? Regensburg is on the route from Vienna to Nuremberg, so we could do a day there if worthwhile.",2024-11-12 03:14:39

* She does not have a driver's license (she has lived in NYC all her life and never needed to drive)
* She does not have a valid non-driver state ID (she has no excuse for this one 😂)
   * She has a DMV appointment today to apply for one
* Her US passport expires in April 2025 (planning on expedited online renewal)
* We have domestic travel coming up in 4 days, international travel in 7 weeks

Since my wife's passport expires within 6 months of our international travel, our predicament is that we want to apply for her passport renewal as soon as possible in case there are delays. However, that means that her only valid form of ID becomes invalidated given that she does not have a valid form of state ID.

I realize that she will be given a temporary state ID after her DMV appointment, but from what I'm seeing online, it is not suitable for TSA ID requirements. I'm thinking that to be safe, we hold off on her passport renewal until we get back from our domestic travel so that her passport is valid.

However, I'm wondering if we could submit her passport renewal and still use her old passport for domestic travel? It seems that TSA accepts identification that has been expired for under 1 year, which I'm thinking applies to this case. I also know that we could technically not have either of these pieces of ID and have TSA verify her in other ways, but wanted to rule this out first.

I'll be calling TSA today to check, but if anyone has any experience or knowledge on this, any insight would be appreciated!",2024-11-12 12:57:14
travel,1gp6i2h,South Korea + Tokyo trip?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gp6i2h/south_korea_tokyo_trip/,19,"Hi all,

I am trying to plan a trip to Asia with some friends in May 2025. For background, we went to Japan for two weeks a few years ago, going to Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, and Osaka. It was our all-time favorite country to visit, and we were able to explore everything we wanted to do. Now, we are debating which country we should go to this upcoming year: return to Japan or experience South Korea.

I looked at roundtrip plane tickets to both Seoul and Tokyo from the midwest USA, and the Japan tickets are half the price ($700 vs $1400). I figured why don't we go to Tokyo for 5 nights and purchase a Tokyo to Seoul and a Busan to Tokyo ticket for $300 to spend 9 nights around South Korea? This way, we fill our urge to return to Japan while getting to experience a whole new country close by.

My main questions include:

1. Does this itinerary even make sense? We would go to Tokyo (5 nights), then go from Tokyo to Seoul, then travel around Seoul (5 nights), then Gyeongju (2 nights) and Busan (2 nights), fly from Busan to Tokyo (stay in Tokyo 1 night), then return to America. I looked at the logistics and the timings make sense in theory.
2. If it does make sense, is 9 nights enough in South Korea? I am thinking about 5 nights in Seoul and 4 nights in Gyeongju and Busan. I think that 5 nights in Seoul is plenty long for us, as 5 nights in Tokyo was great. Any city recommendations in South Korea would be great, or if I should stick with the South Korea plan I have right now.

I feel like this would work in our situation as we have already previously been to Japan, so only going to Tokyo is fine for us as it was our favorite city. Anything I am missing or thoughts on this situation would help greatly.",2024-11-11 23:24:44

We were supposed to fly to Mazatlán, Mexico, for a 14-night stay, but the trip turned into a nightmare. I booked a non-beachfront hotel, which was inconvenient for our group that included an elderly person and a young child. Hoping to resolve this, I used Sunwing’s ‘Worry-Free’ insurance to request a hotel change.

The process seemed smooth—Sunwing confirmed the new hotel and assured me there were no extra costs. However, they didn’t inform me that the new booking was only for 7 nights instead of 14. Without my consent, they shortened our trip and issued travel documents reflecting the change, which I didn’t notice until late the night before our flight.

When I called Sunwing in disbelief, they put me on hold for nearly an hour and told me my only options were to:
	1.	Fly for 7 nights (despite paying for 14) and pay out of pocket to extend the stay.
	2.	Cancel the trip entirely and wait 12 days for a voucher refund.

Ultimately, our vacation was ruined. The lack of transparency, poor communication, and refusal to acknowledge their mistake were shocking. A $6,000 family vacation was reduced to chaos because of their negligence.

Beware: ‘Worry-Free’ insurance doesn’t mean worry-free. This ordeal could’ve been even worse if we had discovered the issue at the airport or resort. Sunwing’s customer service failed us, and I won’t make the mistake of booking with them again.”",2024-11-12 16:46:20

That makes sense for most people, but I typically have points to cover flights and hotels so what I would consider an inexpensive trip might not be the same as someone who has to pay for airfare and lodging. So I'm really looking for travel destinations where the cost for airfare and lodging doesn't matter, I am only really concerned about the cost of the fun activities and tours while I'm there. As far as activities go, I like to go do stuff with my time, not sit around in an all-inclusive resort or hang out at a beach all day. I'm also not particularly active so backpacking/camping/hiking/kayaking/etc are not things that appeal to me. I like things like museums, ruins, snorkeling, various tours, etc. Basically I want to get out and explore and see and do what there is to see and do in a place but I like to be comfortable while doing it. On a budget. 

The best example I can think of that I've been to has been Washington, D.C. because there are so many free museums and tours that you can do. There is also plenty of stuff you can pay for if you want, but you could go there and do nothing but free museums and tour government buildings/monuments for a week and be perfectly happy.

With that in mind, what is your favorite travel destination that has fun low-cost activities/tours where the price of airfare and lodging aren't considered. Why do you like that place, what are your favorite activities?",2024-11-11 18:11:41

I'm not sure what to do from here. I tried calling their U.S. number last week after the three days had passed and didn't get a human. I assume that the link is to download the visa, since it has my name in itn(maybe I'm wrong), but it won't open in Chrome or Edge, not on laptop or mobile.

Will I fill out the documents at my small airport and then be fine until my return flight? I'm expecting to get to the airport earlier than I typically do, but how early is necessary? Thanks in advance for the insight!",2024-11-12 03:14:58
travel,1gpdc9q,Visa Requirement for Indian Citizens with a US H-1B Visa,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gpdc9q/visa_requirement_for_indian_citizens_with_a_us/,5,"Hi everyone,

I'm an Indian citizen currently working in the US on an H-1B visa, which has a total duration of 3 years and is valid until February 2025. I'm planning a two-week trip to Chile either at the end of this month or late December, and I've come across some information that has left me confused.

According to a document I found on the Chilean embassy's website, it states:

""Exento de visa de permanencia transitoria a nacionales de India portadores de una visa otorgada por EE.UU. (excepto la Visa C) con a lo menos 6 meses de vigencia o Green Card, a contar del 01.04.2019.""

(Google Translate: ""Exemption from temporary stay visa for Indian nationals holding a visa issued by the US (except Visa C) with at least 6 months of validity or a Green Card, as of 01.04.2019."")


From what I understand, it might mean that Indian Nationals with a US visa (excluding C-Type visas) don't need a Chilean tourist visa as long as their Visa has at least 6 months of validity. However, I am unsure if this ""6 months of validity"" applies from my date of entry into Chile or if it refers to the initial total validity of the Visa.

I have already emailed two different locations of the Chile Embassy in the US but haven't received a response yet.

Has anyone else with an Indian passport and a US H-1B Visa traveled to Chile recently? Did you need a separate tourist visa, or were you able to enter visa-free?

Thanks a lot/Muchas gracias :)",2024-11-12 05:10:32

I'm going to Malaysia and Borneo next year and was looking for some thoughts on my itinerary. 

Open to suggestions if you think it's worth visiting some other places not on the list, or any suggestions for things to do at the places I've written down.

Day 1 - Arrive in KL

Day 2 - Full day in KL

Day 3 - Flight to Sandakan + drive to Kinabatangan river to stay at homestay

Day 4 - Full day on the river

Day 5 - Half day on the river, then spend the night in Semporna

Day 6-9 - Staying on Mabul Island + diving in Sipadan

Day 10 - Go to Tawau (stay the night here to get early morning flight next day)

Day 11 - Fly to Mulu

Day 12, 13 - Explore Mulu caves

Day 14 - Go to Kuala Lumpur

Day 15 - Fly home



I've had a look at flights around Borneo, and it seems this is the best way to order the locations to reduce transfer times between connecting flights from/to Mulu.

  
Do you think this itinerary is unrealistic?

2 weeks and the main locations are KL, Kinabatangan river, Mabul and Mulu

travel,1gnvx4z,"Argentina…..MEH!
",724,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnvx4z/argentinameh/,616,"After reading a recent thread about how wonderful Argentina is, my thoughts after visiting last month. 

I was a couple of weeks and visited Buenos Aires, Bariloche, El Calafate, Ushuaia and Iguazú. From best to worst: 

Iguazú: the falls are really astonishing.

Ushuaia: very interesting, unique place

El Calafate (Perito Moreno): definitely worth it but for some reason the glacier wasn't that wow feeling I had in Iguazú

Bariloche: rented a car. Cool place but honestly you can see the same stuff or better in some parts in Europe or North America (Alps, Rocky mountains, etc)

Buenos Aires: ran down hole. I spent three days and there were too many. Unsafe, uber expensive, for a big city there are plenty more interesting in Europe and even North America. 

Now the bad things:

**- Safety:** Argentina is NOT a safe country. Buenos Aires is not a safe city despite how locals will try to convince you. Whoever says ""central Buenos Aires is like New York/Miami/London/Paris"" is in complete denial.

I never left premium areas (Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, Belgrano, Microcentro, etc.) and you could see people (locals!) looking around while using their phones. Or whenever I walked down the street, if I ""overtook"" another person on a walkway, he or she will look back to check that I was not ""safety threat"". Many people with their backpacks on the front.

I took Ubers back and forth to La Boca and the areas around where complete slums. I wouldn't have liked my Uber broke down there. xD

On the other hand for instance Ushuaia felt safe. But Ushuaia is a small town isolated from the world.

**- Prices:** I was not expecting Argentina to be cheap but it is a complete joke now. Prices make no logic. The dollar blue (more convenient) is now roughly 10% more convenient than the official rate. So it was not about me exchanging dollars in the wrong places. 

  
Just an example. The Prison in Ushuaia (a small local museum) was 36.700 ARS in September (maybe the prices have been increased because inflation and the website is not updated)

[https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen](https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen)

That means that in the ""dollar blue"" (the unofficial more favorable exchange), it is 32 USD

[https://cuex.com/en/ars\_pa-usd](https://cuex.com/en/ars_pa-usd)

The Louvre museum (they recently increased prices) is 22 EUR. Or 23 USD

[https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission)

So a small museum in Ushuaia is more expensive than the Louvre.

The minitrekking in Perito Moreno (walking in the glacier) is now 480,000 ARS + 45,000 ARS for the entrance to the park (compulsory). So a total of 525,000 ARS or (!) 466 USD just for walking in the glacier (with a group) for about 2 hours. It is nice but nothing really glamourous or private. Just a typical group being taken from left to right on big buses then big boat then big group walking the glacier. 

[https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/](https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/)

I have been quite a few times in Switzerland and once in Norway and I never felt that ""ripped off"". At least Switzerland/Norway are top notch, clean, wealthy countries, but no offence Argentina is at best a ""second world"" country. So you are paying those prices in quite a dysfunctional environment.

**- Inconvenience:** 

Argentina is quite a dysfunctional country so expect inconvenience. For instance, flights. I paid a fortune for domestic flights (I flew Aerolíneas and flyBondi) and I had a few big delays. I could see on the screens plenty of cancelled flights. And right now (as of November 10, 2024) there are strikes that leave airports closed. So good luck if you are stranded in Ushuaia which is like 3,000 km to Buenos Aires which itself is like 10,000 km to the US or Europe. 

My advice is that Argentina is not worth the visit right now. 

Prices are completely out of control. The inflation stuff changes all the time, so maybe booking a holiday 3 months from now means that in January (for instance) prices will be 30% more expensive (or cheaper). 

There are a lot of social issues (I remember - I read Spanish -) reading in the newspapers in the street that 52% of Argentinians live below the poverty line. That means strikes, crime, etc. that can affect you directly or indirectly.

Just wait for things to calm and it might be worth to visit. Skip Buenos Aires (just one day max to check it out) and venture into the nature that is worth visiting.

travel,1gobnnu,How to lose 515 EUR with eDreams without flying anywhere..,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gobnnu/how_to_lose_515_eur_with_edreams_without_flying/,19,"TLDR: eDreams charged 515 EUR service fee for tickets and airline return amount with full cancellation insurance coverage.



Thought I share my dumb experience so that somebody will learn from my mistake.



So, was searching for a round trip to Turkey and  eDreams site had the best price, although only under 100 EUR cheaper than it would have been if bought directly from airline(Pegasus). Bought the tickets. 

Fast forward a week and Pegasus informed me about cancellation of the return flight. Sadly, there were no good alternatives to change to too, however Pegasus was willing to cancel and refund both flights in full. Did so, only to realise, that  227 EUR of the total sum of 1578 EUR had been a eDreams service fee.  Okay, fair enough. Probably lost that.

But the story does not end there. Not only does eDreams not refund the service fee, but they sent me an invoice in a sum of another 288 EUR. So this will also be deducted from any refund. 

But the story does not end there either. I bought the ticket from eDreams with a full insurance, in case on a cancellation in any circumstance. Really, like paid extra 72 EUR for the cancellation insurance from eDreams.

* Any recommendations for car rental companies?
* Is this not recommended given the current Ukraine, or other regional, situations?

The 20+ hours of driving is not an issue, so far my record is driving from the USA to way past Mexico City - through Mexico City - several times, almost 40 hours, not in a single shot.  We want to see, and experience, the local cultures and scenery, so we rather not drive at night or fly.  We are both extremely easy going about foods and accommodations.

I just got my compensation from [airhelp.com](http://airhelp.com), and I promised myself that if it actually worked, I'd leave a good review on reddit. Honestly, 10/10. Was so easy - I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.

As for what happened - I had a 3 legged journey from TLV to the US via london (on a US airline). The airline cancelled my second flight just as I was boarding my first flight. And when I got to the airport for my cancelled connecting flight, the airline was SO unhelpful and rude and it just felt impossible to navigate the situation. They ultimately rebooked the flight but there was still a delay and just navigating the situation was an absolute nightmare. I found airhelp and was like - why not see if I can get compensation (I wouldnt have even thought to look had the airline been helpful/friendly). I submitted my claim via airhelp in August and got my compensation ($438) by mid-November, just to give you an idea of the timeline. Was honestly so easy and I would have never pursued the airline myself b/c they were so rude and dismissive - the airline agent on the phone claimed that there would be zero compensation, no food or hotel vouchers, etc.

One tip for airhelp - stay on top of their customer service. and do so via the chat option on their website (they rarely answer emails). their customer service reps are very helpful on the chat, although you do need to push them a little (e.g., at first airhelp told me that they received my compensation from the airline but that my bank details weren't correct. it took some pushing with the customer service person to find out what exactly wasn't correct. and as soon as i found that out, i corrected it and the compensation was transferred immediately).

The trip was setup to spend 5 days in Valencia and 4 days in Lisbon. I used [Flighthub.com](http://flighthub.com/) to book the flights on TAP airlines.

Valencia has recently undergone major flooding and violent protests by a community that has a right to be angry. I feel for their pain but do not want to visit there as they undergo this period of transition.

All I we want to do is keep the first and final legs of our flight. So IAD to LIS and LIS to IAD. While removing the Valencia segments. TAP has an alert on their website referring to Valencia being in a State of Catastrophe and that free change would be allowed prior to Nov 30. I called TAP and they will not deal with me as they consider Flighthub my travel agent.

Flighthub will not accept my call. Only will consult me on chat. I've chatted with them 2 times. One time for an hour where they claimed to have called TAP and were not authorized to make free change. A second time I decided to inquire about making the changes for the fee.

Again - I repeat I only want to keep my IAD/LIS flights exactly as-is and remove the LIS-VLC segments. I don't need any new flights or changes to flights. I only need to subtract the VLC portion of trip.

Flighthub states that the nature of the changes don't matter. It is a rebooking. And a rebooking at a higher fare class. So in addition to the fees I must pay flight differentials. Total with differentials is $621 per person.

Paying differentials seems absurd in this case. I know I cannot just leave the booking exactly as-is and skip the VLC flight because airlines always cancel all downstream portions of itinerary when customer skips flight.

But if I just leave this all unresolved until I get to the gate this Thursday will a TAP gate agent assist me in ways that the phone/chat customer service is unwilling to? Are they less confined by rules? Or will they just make me call Flighthub?

4) Peppa Pig Theme Park

travel,1gooa7s,Photography in Morocco (Marrakesh in particular),2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gooa7s/photography_in_morocco_marrakesh_in_particular/,10,"Hello folks! I'll be heading to Morocco in a couple of weeks, and as a keen hobbyist photographer it's a trip I'm really looking forward to. One of the things I enjoy about travel is the opportunity to capture the daily life of different cultures, which is something I always try to do sensitively to local laws and customs and without invading anyone's privacy. I take no joy from thrusting a camera in people's faces and acting like I'm taking photographs of animals in the zoo.

I try to do a lot of reading into local laws and customs before visiting a new destination with a camera, but Morocco has been quite hard to get a handle on from afar. There are many articles online that describe Marrakech in particular as a very challenging place to take photographs - that people are generally not happy to be photographed, even if they're not the main subject of the scene. There are also Reddit threads and YouTube videos showing people taking all kinds of street photography and not mentioning that anyone took issue with it at all. And legally speaking, it seems to be a grey area - from what I can tell, there is no law against simply taking photographs of people, but it's a criminal offence if one of your photographs is deemed to invade the privacy of its subject or paint them in a negative light.

I wondered if anyone has any recent first-hand experience of photography in Marrakesh in particular but also Morocco more generally, and can speak to any of the above. Obviously if I want a portrait of someone I will ask permission first, but it's not practical to ask everybody in the area whether they mind being in-frame, and my style of photography leans heavily into people being present in the image. Is this likely to be any bother?

If it helps, I'm likely to be carrying a compact mirrorless digital camera that's near-enough silent, as well as a bulkier 35mm film SLR that makes a loud and unmistakable noise. Some advice says ""use a small mirrorless so that people don't notice"" but that makes me a bit uncomfortable - I'm not looking for ways to *get away with* a social or legal faux pas, but rather a way of shooting photographs that aren't going to make people uncomfortable in the first place.

travel,1gpa48f, How overrun with tourists/tourist shops is Southern Spain? ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gpa48f/how_overrun_with_touriststourist_shops_is/,12,"Looking for a place to travel to in a month for 2 weeks, and Malaga, Seville, Cordoba, Granada would fill the time really well, and I have cheap direct flight available.

I've never been to Spain before, my biggest concern is actually how popular this area might be. I don't want to sound holier than thou when saying this, but my last experience in Venice turned me off so much. So much history and beautiful architecture, ruined by hundreds of garbage tourist shops and glass windowed Guess and Louis Vuitton shops... And walking around the streets felt like you never had a moment to breathe because of how many people were there, none of which were locals.

I've experienced similar things in other popular destinations like Japan and Greece, so I usually try to pick locations that allow me to get off the beaten path a little bit.

However I'm really short on time with planning this trip, and December isn't the greatest time to travel to most of the places that interest me most, so Spain seems like a good choice.

Will I regret it if I'm allergic to massive crowds and super inauthentic tourist overrun locations?",2024-11-12 02:16:01

Something I'd love to do instead is find a trip where I don't really have to plan much: to go somewhere and have a lot of options to just observe / participate in things without much advance notice. 

Perhaps I should be looking at resorts, but I think I would get restless if confined to one area for too long. I like to move around.

I'm on the US East Coast so I feel like the most convenient options will be in the US, Europe, or South America, but I'm really open to anything. I'd like to stay at \~5k USD a week but if there's something really worth doing I'd probably just go for it.",2024-11-11 03:04:07

I vaguely remember just being in class at school, but that’s it. But, as I grew older, I of course read and learned more and more about it. And on my current trip to NYC, I decided to visit the World Trade Center plaza, the pools and lastly the museum. 

For the first two items, I had a tour guide take me and a group through a short history lesson on the construction of the towers, the events of 9/11 itself and the construction of One World Trade Center. After my tour was up, I went to the museum. 

I don’t know what I expected, honestly. I had no idea what I would be walking into. And…yeah. It’s a lot. By a lot, I don’t just mean the tons of artifacts such as wrecked fire trucks, destroyed ambulances, pieces of the tower, seeing images of people jumping from the windows, personal items from the victims, etc. No, I also mean the weight of being there, hearing these stories, reliving the events hour by hour…it weighed heavily on me. You’re literally standing where so many people cried out for help that never found them until it was too late. I was exhausted by the time I left, and I nearly cried afterwards. What really did me in a little tiny bit was hearing Taps being played as I went back up the steep escalator, thinking about the wall of victims. 

If anything, amongst all the turmoil I had witness today, it gave me a much deeper respect for first responders, particularly the firemen. 343. That’s how many FDNY firefighters died that day. Each of them knowing they probably weren’t coming back down the towers, but going anyway. There aren’t enough words to describe how amazing they were. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I went. I really am. But it was a lot to deal with, and it hurt me up inside a bit. ",2024-11-09 23:31:39

They start to board and we are boarding via air stairs.  They have two air stairs, front and back.  But they give no info or guidance.  It’s a damn free for all once they open the doors to walk out to board.  People getting on the front of the plane walking to their seats in the back and vice versa.  It was a complete cluster.  People trying to get by each other in the aisle with bags, no manners at all.  Just a shitshow.  Then, while on the 1 hour full flight, they try and give out food and drink and offering options.  Of course people need an explanation of what is being offered, so by the time they get to the back 1/4 of the plane, they are almost out of time.  They hand you your food and drink, store the carts and in less than 3-4 mins of handing you your meals, walk through telling you to close your trays, they are about to land.  Never came through to get trash.  So, whoever had to clean that flight had to be pissed. Saw many half full cups stuffed in the seat back as I got off (I didn’t get any food or drink, it was only an hour flight).  Second flight, same damn boarding process.  Two stairs, no direction, free for all.  I won’t talk about the FaceTime calls that happened as we were landing or the numerous seats that were reclined upon landing as they are just dumb people who don’t listen.  Both of these flights were international flights connecting through Athens.  I’m very versed with budget airlines, but this was on a whole new level.  Will avoid at all costs going forward.

**Our Interests:**
- Small food/bar tours with locals
- Fun ethical experiences around animals (example from our Vietnam trip - [The Duck Stop](https://www.visitphongnha.com/the-duck-stop/). No wild animals)
- Design/art objects as souvenirs - think ceramics, prints, weird decor etc. not the generic touristy stuff
- Odd museums, stores, buildings etc that will make for a great memory (an example is the cafe where you can kayak around)
Minimal walking (we are slightly lazy and wilt in the humidity)




Here's the outline of our trip:

**Part 1 - Bangkok**

We will be flying here directly and staying for 2-3 days.
Looking for Hotel recs that are conveniently located, Food comas, fun cocktails, Souvenir Shopping, Things that feel luxurious but are not so much in cost, Odd museums etc.

**Part 2 - Diving**

I am a newbie diver looking to add more experience. My sister is only interested in snorkeling. Neither of us are looking for parties but good bars, cafes, restaurants are always welcome so that there is something to do in the evenings. We would also like to stay as close to the beach as possible and away from crowds. 
Looking for Recommendations for which island (Koh Lanta is what sounded nice from my googling), excellent dive shops, gorgeous beaches, great food

Thanks in advance for any help! We'll toast you on my birthday 🥳",2024-11-11 04:41:49

Just looking for some advice for visiting Vietnam. We will be there for 3 weeks and arrive into Ho Chi Minh City.

My thoughts were;

Stay in Ho Chi Minh City for a couple of days and then head to Da Nang/Hoi an. Then find somewhere on the way back down south to visit and potentially finish at Phi Quoc?

  
Ideally want to limit the moving around for this trip and spend some quality chill time with a mix of some history/sightseeing and the odd game of golf. We've travelled a lot of the world and love jumping around but this trip we would prefer more relax time so preference would be staying at some nice resorts through the trip which is the opposite to our backpacking days.

I feel like an old person, but I haven't flown anywhere in quite some time.   
  
I remember there used to be a site where I could just put in destinations (from and to) and see the price for flights for each of the dates. There even was an option to have flight+bus combined, so it would allow for a flight to a different airport and calculate the price of that flight + the bus to your destination. 

If you were young and flexible, you could adjust your vacation based on the price of the flights and I remember scoring many a incredibly cheap flight both to and from places just by waiting a few days up and down.

The general idea is to fly into Rome for a few days, spend the next few days along the Amalfi coast, up to Tuscany and Florence for some time, head to Venice for a few days departing back to the states from Marco Polo Airport.

Does this seem reasonable? Any advice on where to stay along Amalfi as a home base?

Planning a trip to the north of Spain for 4 days, and I'd like to see Asturias and Basque Country. Had a couple of questions I'd love if you guys could help me with!

1. I know 4 days is really tight, and will probably not let me appreciate the depth of the either region. But this is all the time I have off work, and would love to explore both. If I'm quick about it and don't mind missing a few things, can both at all be done in 4 days? What would be the best split of time: 2 days each, or 3 days in Basque - 1 in Asturias, or maybe it's impossible to do both and 4 Basque - 0 Asturias/ 4 Asturias - 1 Basque is the answer

2. Summer would be ideal for the trails in Asturias and the beaches in Basque. But would Nov be an absolute blowout in terms of weather? Especially concerned with the recent floods in Girona... 

3. I don't have a car, so would be relying on public transport completely. Could this be a problem in either place?

4. Any general recommendations for me on must-sees/ don't-bothers

Family of 4 for NZ trip. Kindly note that we are more into nature stuff, and have little interest in food/culture. 

  
Day 1:

9am Arrival AKL, pick -up rental

4pm Hobbiton

9pm: Hotel in Cambridge

Day 2:

9am: Kiwi House

11am: Spellboud Caves (should we do waitomo instead?)

2pm: Drive to Rotorua

7pm Polynesian Spa

Day 3:

9am: Waiotapu

Afternoon: EITHER Taupu Speed Boat Ride OR Te Puia?

Evening : Mithai Maori Village

Day 4: Drive back to AKL, 

12pm  flight to Queenstown. I guess the rest of the day is wasted. Drive to Te Anau

Day5: Milford Sound + Cruise

Day 6: Doubtful Sound

Day 7:

3 options: Franz Josef Glacier OR Mount Cook OR local thrill activities (rafting, biking etc)

Day 8: Fly back to AKL in the morning, take evening flight back to states



The questions I wanted to ask was:

1. Is Mithai worth it? Should we skip it, go back to AKL in the evening (i.e. save a day) and take a early morning flight to Queenstown on Day 4. We will land by 12pm and we can do local activities that day. Saves a day for skipping Maori village

2. Franz Josef Glacier OR Mount Cook OR local thrill activities ? I've already done Banff, Jasper, Iceland, all the US national parks, so this is something really worth driving ?

3. Any way to fit in whale watching in all of this? I didn't find anything near queensland, and the only other alternative is in Auckland at 1.30pm, which means a whole day has to be found somehow.

Thanks in advance for any help and guidance.

I’m just hoping to share my experience from this summer traveling through the Côte D’azur with my parents! I had an amazing time although planning activities in the area for those with mobility issues can be difficult and it is something to be considered when booking travel accommodation or making excursion plans. We stayed in Villefranche-Sur-Mer for a more quiet and relaxed home base and then took the train to Nice, Monaco, Menton, Eze, etc. Along the riviera there are many different options to do, so much so that I would even say that it is worth visiting year-round although some of the smaller towns do end up being nearly deserted outside of the summer tourist season. 

I found the passes provided by the tourist office of the region had the best deals and had many options from water sports/activities, boat tours, museum entrance fees, and shop discounts! They come in 24/48/72hr options and are activated from the first time of use. It’s a really helpful tool and worth the money, especially for the longer passes, and acts as an insurance policy for bad weather or change in plans due to the wide variety of offers and the flexibility of use. 

Unfortunately on my trip I had three 72 hour passes that were never activated and I am willing to sell at a discounted price for 55€ per pass and you can reach out to me here if interested. They are valid until August 17th 2025! I am willing to negotiate price or give discount to college students or elderly first time travelers ☺️

travel,1go1sbn,What am I missing about Rotterdam?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1go1sbn/what_am_i_missing_about_rotterdam/,56,"I moved to Rotterdam about 3 weeks ago and will be here for just under 6 months for an internship. Before this I lived in the beautiful medieval city of Leuven, Belgium and will be going back there for a bit to finish my degree (which is why I'm here for an internship). Before I moved here I had heard from a bunch of people about how cool Rotterdam is, about how they rebuilt it after the war with the specific plan to make it a city with novel and unique architecture and how it's filled with culture and hidden gems all over the place and a great nightlife scene. I visited briefly in April for a night and something about the city just felt a little off to me, like it seemed a little lifeless and empty, but granted it was a Monday night that I visited and the day after it seemed a little more alive so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.

Now that I've been here for a few weeks and explored a number of neighbourhoods, I still feel the same way. Worse than I originally thought, maybe. This doesn't feel like a European city at all and that goes beyond just all the new glass buildings. It has a good transit system thankfully but it's so car-centric with freeways going through the city and all these soulless business parks with Mcdonalds arches all over the place. The new buildings like the cube houses and the markthal are cool to look at but they're massive tourist traps filled with overpriced tourist shit. The wacky-looking skyscrapers in the city centre are cool but they're just apartment buildings or offices so the only utility it really gives you is having something cool to look at as you walk by and it's not like they have any real interesting history behind them. And all of those unique, experimental buildings are concentrated in the city centre, if you go outside of it there's really nothing cool to see it's all just soulless buildings in boring neighbourhoods where there's nothing to do.

And the nightlife - where is it exactly? The party street - Witte de Withstraat - is like a block long. Another nightlife district, oude haven, is just a few bars around a pier and it looks nice but there's not much to it. And in general it just doesn't feel like a very vibrant city. It has a nice shopping district but beyond that and the area around the cube houses there's not many people out walking around. It's all just cars going through. It's ""old town"" area (Delfshaven) is very pretty but there's really nothing to do there except walk around and take pictures. No real reason to go there more than once.

I'm just confused because I kept hearing great things about it. Here on r/travel I looked up posts about the city and people seem positive about it. One person called it the ""coolest looking city in Europe"". Another compared it to NEW YORK CITY in the way that you can go out at any time of the day or night and find anything you want to do. I had friends tell me that they loved Rotterdam because it looks so unique. I just don't see what I'm missing. Aside from the city centre, which looks interesting enough but doesn't have a whole lot to do, it looks so mediocre to me, with so many cars, giant parking lots, soulless business parks, generic bars, uninteresting neighbourhoods, sketchy people, and overall just a lack of culture. I live with 4 roommates and they all agree with me.

I want to see what other people see about this city. As it stands now I would even tell tourists to not come here as there's no point - go straight to the Hague or Gouda. I spent a lot of time in Brussels and I'd always hear about how sketchy, dirty, and overall bad of a city it is but I fucking love that city. It felt like I could do anything there with endless museums, squares, restaurants, and bars to try. I want to feel the same way about Rotterdam so it doesn't feel like I just wasted 6 months of a 2 year trip to europe living in a place I hate when I could have stayed in Belgium.

So really - what is it about this city that makes it so great??",2024-11-10 14:25:43

I've booked my flights to HMC and my return back home from Hanoi. So it's a South to North Vietnam trip. I have also started booking internal flights and travel within Vietnam so that I can start getting a better picture of my trip.

Would love to get your feedback on this itinerary and any obvious issues that I am overlooking. I know at a quick glance, it looks a bit tight but if I give it a thought, 2 days in any place is more than enough for me to start feeling like wanting to move on to another location/destination (Your mileage may vary)

**Here's the itinerary :**

**Day 1 and 2** : Saigon.

**Day 3, 4, 5 :** Fly in to Da Nang on day 3 from Saigon. Primarily explore Hoi An and if that gets boring, venture out to Hue for a day.

**Day 6,7 :**  Take a bus to Phong Nha (either at the end of day 5 or on day 6 early morning). Don't do much on 6th as the day would mostly be spent on traveling. On day 7, explore paradise caves and dark caves.

**Day 8,9 :** Fly in to Hanoi on day 8 from Phong Na. Spend day 8 and 9 in Hanoi.

**Day 10,11** : Bus to Ninh Bin. Spend Day 10 and 11 in Ninh Bin.

**Day 12,13** Bus to Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay. Go for the overnight cruise.

**Day 13,14** Bus back to Hanoi. Chill in Hanoi and take the flight back home on Day 14.

While it may look a bit hectic on the surface, with 2 internal flights the trip does become a bit comfortable. Besides, I am spending atleast 2 days in a place which gives me enough time to explore the place if I don't try to fit too much in these 2 days and take it slow.

After a minor accident that only damaged the left front guard and bumper, we reported it upon returning the car. Immediately, $1,000 was charged to our credit card.

Several weeks later, we received a $4,000 bill. Upon review, we noticed:

* Wheel Repair: The bill included a wheel repair with a photo showing pre-existing damage, which we had documented.
* Unrelated Repairs: The damage was on the left, but the bill included repairs on the right side and some unnecessary ones.

We contacted SIXT, and they promised to remove the wheel repair charge. However, after two more months of waiting, we were told the full $4,000 was still due, though they acknowledged the wheel alignment charges could be removed. Despite our clear willingness to pay for damages we caused, they did nothing to update the invoice, leading us to feel they were portraying us as unwilling to pay.

When we called their claims team, they insisted we pay the full amount due to a lack of invoice updates. They promised an updated invoice, but we never received it.This has been a terrible experience.

We spent 4 full days in BA, 5 in Mendoza area and 2 down in Bariloche. 

BA is an amazing city. It’s huge so plan days accordingly. We stayed in Palermo and found that area to be perfect to explore all the places we wanted. Great restaurants and shops there. 

Mendoza was focused on wine. Split time between Lujan de Cuyo area and Uco Valley. Had a private driver, which not only helped making sure we didn’t drink and drive, but he also was great at helping us understand the history of the areas. Smaller wineries beat the big ones for attention. And if I were to do it again, I’d maybe stay in Uco Valley because it was over an hour ride back to our lodgings at end of the day. 

Bariloche gave us the perfect taste of Patagonia but I want more. I want to go when it is summer and hike the area and do some horseback riding. 

Places we want to see on our next visit:  Cordoba, Salta, Mendoza (more wines!!), Bariloche, Ushuaia. 

Things that surprised us:

Argentine people are warm welcoming and super friendly. 

Argentina is no longer the cheap destination it was only a few years back. 

BA is filled with parks around every corner. And the flowers and vegetation is amazing. 

Credit cards are taken virtually everywhere. We were stressed about the whole bring dollars and exchange then there talk. Yes this is still a good practice but credit card companies are giving a very good exchange rate. Plus, when you exchange $200 US into $AR pesos, you’ll walk away with freaking brick of currency. Not the safest feeling. 

Uber is cheap cheap cheap. But did find that if needing to get from one side of BA to the other during busier times of the day, the traditional cabs get to use the bus lanes and get thru traffic more quickly. 

We are going to go back. Maybe in next 3 years. Loved it!",2024-11-09 01:02:59

...family 2, have been goin all-incluse resort or cruise ship for the majority of their life.

And the last factor are of course our kids, two girls of 5/6 years, their only requirement is to be enterained, i.e. mini club, mini disco etc.

As the other family is willing to escape their usual framework of resorts in Greece, Spain, Turkiye, my first thought for an entry level vacation was Thailand. I loved every stay there, with very well developed tourism etc.

This is why I am looking for recommendations for suitable resorts. 

First one that peaked my interest was the Khao Lak Merlin resort, as I haven't been to this area yet, the national park close by looks AMAZING and the prices are good.

I really want to just find a nice spa to go  to as every Spa Stay I've been looking into is just not a comfortable price point for me, and if I'm not comfortable spending my part I refuse to put that type of financial burden on my friends just for the spa stay not including food and anything else. So I'd rather fine an amazing spa to visit for a day and then we can leave and go back the local hotel/airbnb and still be able to have a good budget to eat at nice restaurants and so on

# Usual china advice apply I guess

Get trip.com on your phone, useful to book trains, hotel, and planes - don’t rely solely on booking.com it doesn’t have any offer in YanJing.  
Get both wechat AND alipay to work to pay (your wechat account won’t be verified and you won’t be able to use it to text, but you need the payment part because some ppl doesn’t accept alipay).  
The nomad esim is from hongkong I believe and doesn’t require a vpn! It’s 12$/30days, check it out here:  [https://esimdb.com/fr/china/nomad](https://esimdb.com/fr/china/nomad).  
I just used apple maps and google maps. If you don't have an apple phone it's probably a good idea to have something else than google maps.

# How to get there by train

(There are roads there so you can also go by car).

The only very slow train to go there go from Neijiang to Zhaotong, here is on trip.com: [https://trip.com/trains/china/list?departureStation=内江&arrivalStation=昭通](https://trip.com/trains/china/list?departureStation=内江&arrivalStation=昭通) (once you click on the link, it won’t show the itinerary you need to select a date but it’s the same train everyday at the same time).  
On [trip.com](http://trip.com) you can check all the stops, one of them is Yanbin which may be practical depending on your itinary. I personally did (all by train except specified otherwise): ChongQing -> ChangDu -> Leshan -> Yanbin -> YanJing -> Zhaotong -> (by direct plane) -> Kunming.  
So Yanbin was better than Naijiang for me. As you can see on this itinerary, there is a direct plane from Zhaotong to Kunming, you should check there might be a direct plane from Zhaotong to whoever you want to go or from elsewhere on the path from Neijiang to Zhaotong, china has a lot of airports you should check you may find a better itinerary than mine.

The station of Yanbin on [trip.com](http://trip.com) is named Cuiping.  
Go to the train station of Yanbin in advance, they were very confused with my non-china passport and it took some time.  
You don’t have to go to the station of YanJing in advance, there is no « security guard » in this station, but it’s a bit hard to find, when you go north from the bridge the road splits in two, take the left path and the train station is where the parking for cars is (on the right of the road), there is no explicit sign but it’s here, take the stairs and it’s at the very top.

On [trip.com](http://trip.com) you cannot buy a ticket from YanJing to Zhaotong for instance, it only works between (I guess) large cities. But it’s ok you go on the train without a ticket and pay there. Similarly you cannot buy a ticket from Yanbin to YanJing, I personally got a ticket from Yanbin to Zhaotong but it wasn’t found on their system anyway, so my guess is that you can go to the train station without a ticket too and buy it there.

There is 2 train station, YanJing and YanJing North. You want to go to stop YanJing North, the city is here, don’t stop at YanJing! Tell everyone you go to YanJing North right away (they didn’t let get off the train at YanJing North and there were no Didi once I was at YanJing 💀 don’t make the same mistake).

Be careful Didi doesn’t work there.

# If you read this from the future

There is a bullet train in construction between ChongQing and Kunming ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing–Kunming\_high-speed\_railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing–Kunming_high-speed_railway)), according to the engineer I met there it’ll be done in 3years. I believe it won’t stop at YanJing, but it may stop close by which may give you better itinerary option than what I did. If you check this post in more than 3years you should get check this train line.

I loved this town very much and it’s not touristic at all, I might open an hotel there. If you check this post in more than 2years please come to my hotel :)",2024-11-09 13:28:57

travel,1gnt1rc,25 days surprise last minute vacation - debating where to go,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnt1rc/25_days_surprise_last_minute_vacation_debating/,3,"Hi Reddit!

I was awarded last minute vacation from work. I’ve never had such a long vacation before. I am debating on where I should go. I’m based in Portland, OR and I’ve been to a large chunk of Asia, the Middle East, and Japan. 

These are the places that are very high on my list and I would be leaving December 7th so I have to plan fast:

- Peru for Rainbow Mountain and Machu Pichu (I checked and you can still buy permits right now for the dates I would be there)
- Thailand for the beaches, elephants, and temples. Maybe combine with Singapore
- Taipei and Hong Kong (the food, skyscrapers, people, nature and hiking)
- Portugal (still have never visited Iberia)
- Cologne, DE for Christmas Markets

Some considerations:

- In my mid 20s, traveling solo
- Budget isn’t a consideration for me
- I once flew to Paris for 4 days so I don’t get exhausted hopping around continents
- I do have a reptile phobia, so I worry I might have a hard time in Thailand

Some ideas:

- Taiwan + Hong Kong for 10 days, then Thailand for 10 days, then Singapore for a few days
- Peru for 8-10 days, then fly to Mexico City, then to Germany for Christmas markets or to Portugal
- Peru for 8-10 days, then off to Thailand via flying to LA (no direct flights between Asia and SA)

These aren’t final and I’m open to any number of suggestions. I’ve never had this much time off so I’m unsure of how to plan this trip. I also have vacation time next year so I can go to these destinations in 2025 as well. So if I miss Thailand this trip I could go in 2025. ",2024-11-10 04:56:25

travel,1gnxzpf,Travelling mainland Europe- worth buying a car?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gnxzpf/travelling_mainland_europe_worth_buying_a_car/,19,"Hello everyone, I am 24F and live in Ireland currently (originally from Belarus) and have a car of my own. I was planning to solo travel around mainland Europe next year and was wondering if it was worth buying a cheap car in the likes of France/Germany and driving instead of taking public transport. I would prefer to do this low cost (~€10k allocated budget for the trip). I will be starting the trip in Paris, and will most likely need the car from Spain onwards.

My thinking: (excuse my formatting I’m on mobile)

**1.** My car is right hand drive, and all of mainland Europe is left hand drive. Although I *could* drive in my own car, I am afraid it would be too much hassle and confusion, but I have also not driven in other countries before. I have 4 years of driving experience.

**2.** I’ve been looking into housesitting and apps like Worldpackers for accommodation, and although there are many options, some are in very remote areas where you’d absolutely need a car. I would also like to occasionally sleep in the car, and leave my backpack in it.

**3.** I would like to explore remote areas and have some freedom on the places I visit

**4.** Public transport is amazing in countries like the Netherlands, France, and Germany, but from what I remember, public transport in Eastern Europe doesn’t go far out outside of big cities. 
Balkan countries you also primarily need a car for. 

**5.** I looked into the interrailing pass but even with that, I’ve heard some people still have to buy train tickets/book seats which you may need to do in advance, this is a more relaxed and spontaneous trip so I don’t have an exact itinerary of length of time and dates

**6.** I am planning to start this tour in April 2025, so half of it will take place during peak summer season

So please tell me, is this a good idea? Should I just suck it up and buy an interrailing pass and rent a car in places where I need it? Is it too much hassle with insurance, buying/selling? All advice appreciated :)",2024-11-10 10:43:17

However once I started dating my current partner, traveling with him has often left me with this unfulfilling feeling. I've traveled many places with him so this is not a one off experience. Side notes, I love to explore the hidden paths with breath taking sceneries as well as visiting historical sites with old architectures. Pretty much I just wanna see everything that is uniquely to that destination. My partner on the other hand, is a man with few words. He never seems excited for anything I planned and doesn't really initiate anything that he wants to do and I feel like I'm the only one doing all the planning, which I don't mind at all but I feel like he isn't enjoying the itineraries that I've created. Also, he loves comfort and often love to just stayed in at resorts and explore the food culture which there is nothing wrong with that. I do compromise and make sure to include the things he would like to do based on the little info he has communicated to me. However, when we get to do the things I wanna do, he always shows no interest and most of the time just tags along. On some other occasions, he would opt out or refuse to participate in extreme water sports or thrilling activities (bungee jumping or skydiving). I feel like he just not really down to explore anything new and really stuck in his way. AITA for thinking he's just a boring person with no interests in trying new things? Is there anything I can do to help make things more exciting for the both of us?

Notes: We're going on vacation in 2 days and going to 2 location in Vietnam (Dalat & Phu Quoc). Dalat is relaxing and Phu Quoc is and island with many beaches as well as resorts. We're staying at resorts because he wanted to and I don't mind. But when I ask to rent a motorbike together and explore the island for one day, he refused and proposed that just hire a private driver to do this. I don't really want to, since I would rather spend intimate time alone with him. How can I change his mind?

I went to Costa Rica with my cousin in 2015 (before wife) and had the time of my life. We rented a car in the Osa Peninsula, eventually going to Arenal, and on to San Jose, where we flew out. It was incredible. We started in Puerto Jimenez with a guided wildlife tour (some dude we just met on the street) of Corcovado. Then we rented a car and drove north along the coast. We would wake up, drive a little, smoke some weed, and hit pristine and chill beaches every couple hours or so. It was very cheap and reasonable. We stayed in small towns. People were friendly, vibes were great. I had travelled throughout Latin America and felt safer there than anywhere else. We had nothing booked and just ended up at low-key hotels.

My wife and I are not luxury travelers, but do enjoy a more ""comfortable"" situation at this point in our lives - we've progressed past hostels, but love a ""sandy feet, laminated menu"" vibe.  I don't expect to have the same exact experience that I had a while ago, but I would really rather avoid diving into the disappointments of staying in a resort. The comments I read on this sub make me think everything has become prohibitively expensive. I've seen comments that suggest a lunch is at minimum $25, which seems impossible to me.

Though I think being in our 20s is not helping the situation.

Where are some places we could go that is cheaper to fly into (bigger airport since I have friends across the mainland who would be coming) but also we could drive a few hours away from the big airport to somewhere more remote with good hiking.

I had been considering Utah, but then realized in February it’s super cold, I don’t mind it being a little cold but not in the negatives. 

Considering Arizona as an option? 

Or somewhere in the south? But then also places in the south are currently recovering from the hurricane…

Hey everyone, I need to share my experience with you about Kiwi.com. The company where everything's great until you hit a snag? Then it turns into a complete nightmare and you kick yourself for ever using them.

I booked two business class tickets with self-transfers:

Paris to Madrid AND Madrid to Bogota

About 10 days later, they email me saying my Madrid-Bogota flight was ""delayed"" and would arrive earlier, so I would miss it and would not have time to do the self transfer. To fix this, I needed to drop $3,000 on a new Madrid-Bogota. I kind of ignored it since I figured I'd just adjust the Paris-Madrid flight myself.

Then, 2 days later, they hit me with another email claiming ""the **airline canceled my flight**"" (See the screenshot, no room for misinterpretation here). They wanted me to click their option button to buy:

A new $3,000 Madrid-Bogota ticket

AND a new Paris-Madrid ticket for about $400

I immediately called both airlines:

Air Europa: ""Nope, nothing's canceled or changed. You're still good to go.""

Iberia: They surprisingly told me that since it was a business, I could change to a later flight for free.

I flew last week on both airlines, which **NEVER CANCELED** any of my flights, without extra costs, everything was smooth.

Kiwi tried to squeeze an extra $3,400 out of me when they could have just guide me or be fair and told me to contact airlines. Or simply not tried to sell me tickets I didn't need.

I know my way around travel booking and stuff, but imagine if this happened to someone's grandparent not as saavy or someone who doesn't book flights often. They probably would've panicked and paid up just to make sure they didn't lose their flight.

Upon researching a bit further, I have found two particular options for booking that interest me. One of them is riding as a regular coach or maybe deluxe passenger, while the other is riding along with the engineer in the locomotive. However, the price difference is very significant (120 vs 250), so I’m wondering if other train enthusiasts have found this worth the money. Admittedly this question is very ordinary and has probably been asked many times, something I’m really interested in finding out the answer to is this: ***would I still have access to the open air train car even with a “ride with engineer” ticket?

Here are my thoughts:

Which of the three places - Tromsoe, Iceland or Rovaniemi - have you visited and why did you choose that location? What advantages and special features does each place have to offer?

Is a rental car absolutely necessary for the trip, or are there also good alternatives for exploring the area?

What are your recommendations for the right clothing? I want to be well prepared for the cold temperatures and at the same time be comfortable and mobile.

How deep is the snow usually in these regions and what are the road conditions like? Is it easy to drive a rental car, or are there certain challenges to be aware of?

Have you done any aurora tours, and if so, were they worth it? What were your experiences and recommendations for such tours?

Are there any other important aspects I should consider when planning to have the best experience?

I look forward to your answers and hope you can help me with your experiences and tips. Let's explore the magic of the Northern Lights together and plan an unforgettable trip!

After booking my stay at The Westin Punta Cana, Prestigia unexpectedly canceled my reservation without my consent. I only discovered the cancellation when I contacted the hotel directly, and despite being reassured that my booking was active, I later learned that Prestigia had canceled it and then tried to reinstate it weeks later without notifying me.

This entire ordeal has been exhausting. I had to rebook through another agency at additional cost and have had zero cooperation from Prestigia in resolving the issue. They even insisted on charging a cancellation fee for a cancellation they initiated!

Their lack of transparency, coupled with poor customer service and inconsistent communication, makes it clear that this company is unreliable and untrustworthy. I’ve disputed the charges with my credit card company and caution others to avoid Prestigia entirely to save themselves the time, stress, and money wasted on an agency that doesn’t value its customers.",2024-11-09 18:54:20

- a private, luxury room with amenities such as a private infinity pool, soaker tub and luxury shower. We want the room to have beautiful views. It is also important to us that we don’t run the risk of having loud neighbours right beside us who could potentially blast music on their balcony or disrupt our peaceful vibe, so we are hoping for a private/sheltered room. 

- great food and lots of selection (an all inclusive would be great, but we are also not opposed to venturing out for some meals as long as we don’t have to go far). 

- a safe, relaxed and slow paced environment. We have a tendency to get up at the crack of dawn to explore so we want something incredible that makes us want to stay put at our room/villa.

- We are envisioning spending the majority of our time lounging around our room and beautiful scenery surrounding the room. Our typical day would be getting up early to sip coffee while watching the sunrise from our room, reading/ lounging/swimming all day, going for a nice dinner every evening and repeat. 

We have done Dominican Republic all-inclusives before but we are looking for a more impressive room/villa to set our honeymoon apart and make it extra memorable.

My rough plan is to spend about a week and a half in each city, doing my best to see everything (museums, libraries, bookstores, etc).

For example, I’ll see Rome but skip Venice; I’m going to Madrid but not Barcelona. 

Part of why I’m moving quickly is because life is short and I'm most likely going to be diagnosed cancer. Few years ago found out my dad had cancer and he passed away. My mom now has cancer but luckily she's okay. I want to experience as much of the world as I can, while I can.

I don't think it will be easy to find chicken nuggets or fried chicken in Florence or Europe in general (let's say we go to Vienna as well).

I am burnt out. I am almost 30. I need a short career break and some new perspective/experiences.

I have been toying with this idea for some time now and it's been encapsulating my mind more and more over the months. I am single, with no kids, no pets. The only main responsibility I have is to take care of my mortgage of a home I bought a year ago. It's very unlikely that will be an issue because it is a place I can rent out to cover the mortgage expenses. I certainly won't make a profit but I can just about break even on it.

  
In terms of financial side of things, I have about £15,000 savings. I don't intend to eat into all of the money as I must have enough to cover for emergency purposes (especially if I become a landlord). My best option is travel as economically as possible, and am leaning towards arrangements where I can work/volunteer in exchange for a place to stay (with food is a big plus). I've heard from people that this is possible but I need to some guidance on how to find these opportunities. Do these arrangements need a lot of notice? I've seen Workaway as an example but not sure if it's a trusted source.

I also want to be able to have an option to travel on a budget without paying extortionate prices for flights. If its means trains, buses, car etc, i'm open to these things.

I'm open to any destination. Travelling through South America for example is a very appealing idea for me. 

I'd like the journey to last months, even up to 12 months. I may even consider a 6 month rent contract for my place and put it on month-to-month rolling.

I need inspiration and any advice on how to start this would be greatly appreciated!

I live in Athens for two years and one question bothers me during my regular hiking around the city: why those natural hidden gems are so underrated?

Just one case! This stunning stone arch you may see on the above pics is located in just 5 km from the metro station. The entire route is about 10 km. However, it's not that popular as you could suppose, it's almost unknown even to locals, let alone tourists.

So I'm curious to know some things.

Do you plan any hiking activities when traveling abroad?

If you stay for a few days in capital cities (layover, etc.), would you be interested in visiting some not that well known, but not less amazing locations?

To be honest, people visiting only 'classic' touristic points and neglecting some unpopular beautiful spots make me upset a little bit. There's plenty of less known places which worth to see.

travel,1gmqif8,Tanzania trip next September. Any tips?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmqif8/tanzania_trip_next_september_any_tips/,5,"Hello. I'm planning to go from Peru to Tanzania next September. Any tips to consider? 

Some questions:

Is it better / easier / safer to see the great migration in Kenya, Tanzania, or both? Any important differences between the experience in both countries? Fees, street safety in the important cities, commute from and to airports, etc .

Any tour companies you personally recommend? Is it better or worth bookings some things when you are already there, to get it cheaper? 

I understand the great migration attracts many tourists. What game reserves which might be not as popular as Serengeti or Masai Mara would you recommend?

Is it better to only exchange money at airports, or are there any other exchange places where you get a better exchange rate?

What other things besides the safaris are worth seeing in both countries? I know the beaches are beautiful but please let me know if it's worth visiting them (safety, cleanliness, accomodations).

It's probably worth saying I plan to travel with wife, both 40 years old. Still fit for long walks and waiting times. Also, being from LATAM and having been in South Africa for safaris before, we know how to deal with some safety issues that would scare a European visitor!

By now we had lost the flights from LIS-LHR,
LHR-SIN and SIN-DRW.
We then approached TAP staff at the airport, trying to find a solution, they provided no assistance and showed no sympathy, didn’t nothing to help, even lying about the reason we missed the flight saying we walked way from the gate.
Multiple complaints were made to TAP airlines to witch the airline said we didn’t follow their rules.
TAP airlines showed no interest, even when asked to provide a letter stating the reason why we missed the flight.

travel,1gmm0px,A week in Europe in mid-November at the last minute - solicitation for ideas,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmm0px/a_week_in_europe_in_midnovember_at_the_last/,23,"I'm planning to take next week off - Monday is a holiday and I didn't travel much in the summer and have some vacation time I need to use. I live in Chicago, and am flying United (I have flight benefits). I would leave tomorrow, (Saturday 9 November) and can come back as late as the following Sunday, though a day later would work if needed for flight purpposes. So roughly 6-7 days So my destination considerations are all UAL destination cities. I want to go somewhere I haven't been before, and most of these destinations are either all new to me or substantially new. I have done some research (I almost traveled in October) but some beta from others who know the places would be nice. This seemed like a good place to ask. Options below:

1)Fly to Paris. Would spend a day or two visiting friends outside the city. Beyond that I thought I'd take a train and visit Nimes. With a whole week maybe go back to Paris and then to Strasbourg, from where I could visit the National Automobile Museum in Mulhouse.  Is Basel worth considering? What other places are worth considering? What about, say, Rouen? I have been to Paris and the Dordogne and that is it for France for me. Flights are direct from ORD.

2)Fly to Lisbon. I was going to go to Lisbon and Porto in July with friends and then Crowdstrike happened. Never been to Portugal but have beta from the friends so a relatively known option. Bonus is that it's warm and sunny. I have to connect through EWR or IAD, so a bit more flying risk.

3)Fly to Berlin. I've never been to Germany. Berlin and Munich are the cities that interest me most, probably in that order. No idea what I'd want to see there since I hadn't thought about it much. Have to connect to get there.

4)Fly to Munich - see above. Direct from ORD.

5)Fly to Milan. I've never been to Italy either. I could go to Rome but for some reason the north interests me more and it's a safer flying option. Bonus us there's a big classic car show in Milan at the end of the week. From here I could take trains to Turin, also to Modena (Ferrari - I'm very much a car person) or Bologna. Lago di Garda? I like trains but perfectly happy to drive somewhere in a rental if it makes sense (I find Europe a pleasure to drive in) Direct from ORD.

6)Fly to Frankfurt. Frankfurt itself doesn't interest me, but I could get a rental and visit the Nurburgring from there (bucket list item), also Strasbourg (see above) seems doable. What is worth seeing in that part of Germany?

Edit: 7)Fly to Barcelona. I have been to Barcelona before and the idea here would be go to to the Pyrenees and go hiking and stay in one or two places that are smaller, interesting, not expensive and quiet. I assume I would rent a car for this. I suppose I could go to France, too. I have to connect through EWR or IAD, so a bit more flying risk.

Buenos Aires is also an option and I have good beta on that, but I'd probably rather wait until I can spend two weeks in Argentina. Cape Town is also a stretch option.

Ideas welcome! I'd like to keep total cost excluding flights to under $1000USD. The more under the better but I'll pay for experiences if it's worth it.",2024-11-08 16:06:07

Looking for some feedback for how to structure my time in cusco.

My interests: I would really like to see 
1. cusco city (self guided) 
2. cusco ruins (saqsayhuaman, temples etc) ideally with a tour 
3. bit of the sacred valley.  My interests are mostly active culture, citys, and landscapes. I appreciate ruins but am not too thrilled at the thought of touring them for a full day.

Itinerary is:
DAY 1
- land in cusco at 12pm. 
- Plan- stroll around, get currency, sim card
- city tour???

DAY 2
- undecided plans. Debating between 1- Sacred valley full day bus tour. 2- Cusco city tours with ruins 3- ATV tour of maras moray.
Open to suggestions here??
- I want to account for acclimatization time. I want to have a good time and not be miserable and sick. 
-The ATV tour sounds the most exciting but i don’t know if i will be acclimated enough to do it right on day 2? 

DAY 3- full day machu picchu tour
DAY 4-6- Amazon tour, return to cusco
DAY 7- 
- flight to cusco at ~6pm
- would ideally like to take it easy & just stroll around. But im open to any activity tour ideas? 


Questions-
- looking for suggestions for how to structure my time to see cusco city, cusco ruins and sacred valley between day 1, 2 and 7. 
1. Should i do a city tour on Day 1 after landing? Most city tours run 1-2pm onwards. Which i don’t think would be realistic given the time I land in cusco, check in, i need to get currency, sim card etc?
2. What would you suggest for Day 2? Your experience with doing an ATV tour on day 2 in cusco? Will it be ok with acclimatization time? 
3. Anything I can do in the morning of day 7? 
4. Where could i fit in a tour of the ruins in cusco? I would ideally like a guide?

I am well aware that this is limited time but its all I have :(

travel,1gmmcb0,Slow Travel Taiwan for 3 Weeks - Mid November,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gmmcb0/slow_travel_taiwan_for_3_weeks_mid_november/,2,"Hi Reddit!

We’ll be spending three weeks in Taiwan from November 23 to December 13, right after a three-week road trip through Hokkaido and a week in Kansai. Since we love immersing ourselves in culture, enjoying nature, and savoring street food, we're hoping to make Taiwan a memorable experience.

Our plan so far is to base ourselves in three main regions, allowing for some flexibility and day trips:

# Itinerary Outline:

* **Taipei** – 1 week (may shorten to 3-4 days)
* **Tainan** (Western Taiwan) – 1 week
* **Taitung and Hualien** (Eastern Taiwan) – 1 week

# Travel Style:

My wife, an architect, and I both enjoy cultural and historical activities, scenic hikes, and good street food. We prefer slow travel with plenty of time to explore a region, making it our home base for nearby day trips rather than rushing from one sight to another. Crowded cities are our least favorite parts of travel, though we’re fine with metro areas that are more spread out and slower-paced. To give an idea, we prefer the laid-back feel of places like Seoul or Mexico City over the hustle of Tokyo or Bangkok.

We’re not on social media, so for us, it’s all about the experiences rather than ticking off popular spots.

# Looking for Suggestions On:

* **Day Trips & Must-Sees**: What are the can't-miss places or hidden gems in each of these regions? Any architectural highlights, nature spots, or quiet towns nearby?
* **Avoiding Crowds**: Are there touristy spots we should avoid due to crowds? We’re okay skipping popular sites if they’re likely to be too busy.
* **Best Hiking in the East**: We’ve heard amazing things about hiking in Eastern Taiwan. Any specific trails or regions we should prioritize?

# Current Ideas

**Taipei Region** (Short Stay):

* **Day trips to**: Jiufen, Shifen Waterfall, Yangmingshan National Park for nature and some iconic spots outside the city bustle.
* **Exploring neighborhoods**: We’ve heard Dadaocheng and Beitou Hot Springs are worth exploring for a bit of history and relaxation.

**Tainan** (Western Base)

**Taitung & Hualien** (Eastern Base):

* **Best Hiking**: Would love trail recommendations, particularly in Taroko Gorge and anywhere else quieter but equally scenic. 
* **Nature Day Trips**: The Rift Valley sounds amazing—any particular spots to focus on?

Any suggestions on other regions worth adding or if our current plan might need tweaking would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for helping us shape this trip!",2024-11-08 16:19:46

1. Spend a few days exploring Cape Town and then head off to Namibia for a desert adventure in Sossusvlei and Swakopmund.
2. Return to South Africa for a safari experience, possibly in Kruger or Pilanesberg, before flying to Zanzíbar.
3. Finally, end the trip relaxing on the beautiful beaches of Zanzíbar, soaking in some island vibes before heading back to Cape Town and then home.

I know it sounds pretty packed, and that’s why I’m here: **Is this itinerary too ambitious?** Or is it totally doable with the right planning?

The thing is, it’s **not easy for me to travel so far away**, so I’d love to make the most of this opportunity and visit as much as possible. At the same time, I want the trip to be **enjoyable and not feel rushed** or overly exhausting.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience traveling in these countries or doing something similar.  Are there challenges I might not be considering, like logistics or fatigue from moving around so much?

We had taken off with one hour delay. 2 hours into the flight, the pilot announces that they have to return to the original departure airport due to unspecified reasons. Turns out a drunk man was being disruptive.

Once we land and the man is arrested, they cancel the flight, without any accomodation, siting that they cant fly more than 14 hours with the crew and do not have hotels to book at this point.

I had to be back in London as I have a son to take care of, so I booked an alternative flight directly throught their website immediatelly. That flight was confirmed and i was able to check in.

In the same process, BA put me on another flight, which arrives later, I did not accept the proposed new flight as I already booked a new one. 

Note that the initial booking was done via my company's booking agent (Navan) and they initiated the refund request of the original flight.

Instead of landing at 2pm on the 28th, I landed at 730am on the 29th. 

I have to claim both the flight cost and delay compensation.

My husband (34M) and I (38F) are booked onto an 18 day Intrepid tour, starting in Hanoi and ending in Bangkok. We arrive in Hanoi around 8pm, and our tour group welcome meeting is at 6pm the next day, thus we have most of a day in Hanoi with no plans.

Vital info:  
Our tour **does** **not** include Ninh Binh, so we could squeeze in a visit on our first day.   
Our tour **does** include another full day in Hanoi after a trip out to Halong Bay, so we will see more of Hanoi a few days later.

Questions:

Is it worth spending a full day (day 1, in fact) on a day trip out to Ninh Binh?  
If not Ninh Binh, is there another trip/activity that's preferable?  
Is it feasible to do this day trip and be back in Hanoi for a 6pm meeting?

I’ve heard that Norway, Iceland, Finland, and Canada are good options, but I’d love to know which one you’d recommend based on your experiences.

I also want to know which time of the year offers the best chances of seeing them. I’ve read that winter is ideal, but I’m not sure which specific months have the highest activity or the best weather conditions.

Another important question: what kind of clothing should I bring? Coming from Chile, I’m not used to such extreme climates, so I’m concerned about the cold and would like to know how to dress to stay warm and comfortable.

Are there any specific tours or reputable companies you recommend for Northern Lights tours? It would also be great if you could guide me on how to book and whether it’s better to reserve in advance or decide when I arrive.

Finally, any additional advice on how to prepare for this experience would be very much appreciated—from photography tips to advice on avoiding crowds.

Safety; we would like to stay at an Airbnb or potentially a hotel but we’re travelling with young children so we’re looking for somewhere safe, which I know is relative.

Cost; flying from Ontario (likely YYZ) in mid-March, cost of accommodations as well as food and transportation options at the destination.

I originally booked a flight from SEA to BLR via LHR on Virgin Atlantic, but due to an airline schedule change, they informed me I’d miss my connection in London. They informed me only 10 days prior to the flight and I was left with limited options - either travel a week later or fly out from a different city. The former was not possible, so I asked Virgin to rebook me on a new itinerary, but it now departs from LAX instead of SEA. They refused to provide a connecting flight from SEA to LAX since it was na award ticket. 

This has added about 10 hours to my trip (although I’m reaching my destination at the right time). I would also need to book and pay for a separate Seattle-to-LA flight out of pocket. 

I’m trying to understand what kind of compensation I should request. From what I know, they may need to cover my Seattle-LA leg since it’s their schedule change that caused the issue. Additionally, UK/EU passenger rights might entitle me to compensation due to the delay. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation?

Things I'd love to ask is; 

1. Is there a night bus from San Gil to Bogota? I considered flying to Armenia from San Gil but it feels like we'd lose a whole day travelling to Bucaramanga, the flight, then another flight. So perhaps a better use of time to travel to Bogota in the evening and fly out the next day?
2. Are we broadly spending too much time in Salento/Filandia? I'm thinking perhaps I could cut down a day here but wondering where to add it onto if any has any advice. 
3. I'm also thinking perhaps it could be worth flying to Palomina after work on Day 3 instead so I have one full day in Bogota? And then I'd still have time to chill in Palomina as we wouldn't need to be in Riohaca till the evening.
4. Generally what do people think? The one thing I'm sad about is not getting time in Medellin but unfortunately just not sure how to squeeze it in!

The time traveling would be from Mid June till mid September. Our idea is to start in one city and depart in another or maybe we will just round trip form one city. 

The question is would you start in London in mid June and then make your way around like a backwards C so like London-Paris-Amsterdam-Berlin-eastern Europe then come back south and hit Italy southern France Spain and then Portugal?

Or would you start in Lisbon and go southern Spain, Southern France, Italy, Eastern Europe, Germany, Amsterdam, Paris, London and then exit out?

Or is it best to just start and end in one city like start in London and then end in London?

Can’t really decide factoring weather and what would be most fun. Since we spend most our time in west Texas we think about breaking up the traveling for the baby like going from Texas to New York and then NY to Europe. So would kind of pit stop in New York for a few nights before crossing the Atlantic or if we should just go one play all the way direct there. We see the airlines offer a baby bassinet that he should be able to lie down in. 

Any ideas are appreciated and we could out stop almost anywhere. Wife has never seen New York and I also tell her we could put stop in Miami and then cross the pond since I have never been there. Or even a place like Boston might be cool but part of me thinks just shoot the juice and get to Europe and start enjoying. 

Thank you in advance. ",2024-11-08 05:27:36

However, neither airlines even provide the option for me to do so.  On Avianca, the website doesn't even have the option to select Singapore as the destination, and on SIA, their website also doesn't provide me the option to select Lima as the origin.  

So my question is, how are OTAs able to sell this particular flight route then, if none of the airlines in the flight route even acknowledges the other airlines in their own website?  If I were to purchase this flight route on the OTA, should I be expecting separate tickets for each airline and will then have to make a self-transfer, even though the ticket is bought on a single ticket on the OTA?

I’m going to Malaysia in December and started working on the itinerary but I have a feeling it might be too much maybe and I’m looking for someone who did a similar trip and could advise.

3 nights but 2 full days Kuala Lumpur (Batu Caves, Twin Towers, Little India, few markets and temples, maybe half a day trip to Selangor) would the Selangor be too much? Should we just focus on the city?

3 nights in Singapore (going by bus) here we don’t have anything specific planned, just strolling around, maybe renting some bikes to ride around the city, we’ll be there for NYE so will go and see the festivities). Happy to take any recommendations.

2 nights Langkawi (flying from Singapore) the plan is to see the Pantai Cenang and the north of the Island, if we have enough time we would do the cable car and the Mangroves. Initial plan was to spend 4 nights in Langkawi but we found out about Koh Lipe which seems very much like our vibe and I think we will need a bit of quiet so decided to go there.

4 nights in Koh Lipe - taking the ferry from Langkawi and chilling there for few days, visiting near by islands. Since the ferry and immigration will take us a while we decided to give it more time plus it looks unreal. However I am a bit worried about going back, does anyone know if we will have to go through immigration in Malaysia on the way back again? Same day we will have a flight to Penang so planning on taking n early boat, does anyone you think they are reliable in therms of being on time etc?

2 nights in Penang Georgetown - here the focus is on the food but we want to visit the Blue Mansion and the Jetties and all possible food markets. We are thinking whether we should take a train or a plane back to KL from which is our flight back home. Flight seems shorter but since our flight is early morning we would probably just stay near the airport but if we take a train in takes us to the airport enter, right?

1 last night in KL but as mentioned the plan is to stay by the airport as we fly early in the morning.

What do you think, is it too much or totally doable?

I'm planning a trip to Japan for 14 days ((dates are flexible) from Late April to Early May. So far, I’m considering spending 10 days in Tokyo and 4 days in Kyoto. I would love to get your advice on whether this sounds like a good itinerary or if you have any suggestions for adjustments.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

* **Tokyo (10 days):** I plan to explore the major districts, including Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Asakusa, along with day trips to places like Nikko or Kamakura. I’m also interested in visiting museums, gardens, and experiencing Tokyo’s unique culture and shopping scene.
* **Kyoto (4 days):** I want to visit some of the famous temples, shrines, and gardens, like Fushimi Inari-taisha, Kinkaku-ji, and Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. Would 4 days be enough to explore the key sights and still have time to enjoy the atmosphere of the city?

**Additional questions:**

* Do you think the Tokyo portion is too long or too short for a first-time visitor?
* Any must-visit places or hidden gems in Tokyo or Kyoto?
* I’m traveling during Golden Week (late April to early May), so I’m aware of the crowds. Any advice on how to deal with that?

In Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, you need to register your stay with the police within 24-48 hours of arrival.

Normally your hotel will do this, but I'm wildcamping every night,, and don't really want to go to the police myself (opens to door to bribes, other BS).

People who cycle toured, vanlifed, hiked or hitchiked and then wildcamped through these countries, how did you register, or did you have any problems if you didn't? If this rule is no longer enforced that would be perfect. When you exited did anyone mention the registration?

* **Arrival**: Land in Frankfurt on December 17 and pick up a car.
* **Route**: I’m thinking of driving the Romantic Road, starting from **Würzburg**, and aiming for about **2 hours of driving per day**, with stops at scenic spots and castles. I’ll need to book a few hotels for the 17th–19th.
* **Final leg**: On December 20, I’ll drive back to Frankfurt to check in to the hotel for the remainder of the trip.

* **Driving route recommendations**: Are there any must-see stops between Würzburg and Frankfurt along the Romantic Road? What are some scenic spots and castles I shouldn’t miss?
* **Hotel suggestions**: Any charming or cozy hotels along the Romantic Road that are perfect for this time of year?

A little about what I want from this trip: 
- beautiful hiking/adventure (Guatemala blew me away. Is there something similar here?)
- I’ve seen so many ruins in other countries, so they are not a priority for me here 
- nice beaches
- occasional night out, but nothing like Thailand
- culture & food
- somewhere not boasting with holiday tourists like tulum or Cancun (or please correct me if I’m wrong about that assumption)

I have been searching through Reddit (had a nice convo with someone on a 4 year old post), Trip Advisor, and the resources that the Embassy gave me (vague), but wanted to hear if any of you have recent experience in this.

My husband and I are US citizens (born here) and would like to vacation for a week in Panama in 2025.

20 years ago, my husband was found to have a small amount of marijuana on him. He did no jail time and had a misdemeanor charge. He hasn’t been in any trouble since, has no warrants, etc. He says it was expunged.

Do any of you have any first hand knowledge if this would likely pose a problem? Most things I’m reading indicate it should not be an issue because of how minor the offense was (at least minor in the US) and how long ago it was, but there is the risk because “Panamanian immigration reserves the right to deny entry to any person with a criminal conviction” (travel.state.gov).

I am nervous to book flights, lodging, excursions, etc. if we were likely to be turned away.

Plus they’ve got those textured tiles on the ground for people with visual impairments, and what I love's staff is always around to help.

Canada’s been great too, esp in cities like Toronto and Vancouver. Ramps, elevators, and accessible public buildings are easy to find. Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia also seem to be on top of it when it comes to accessibility.

travel,1gm3bgp,Is this traveling style possible?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gm3bgp/is_this_traveling_style_possible/,19,"My mother and I are considering going on a long, \*long\* trip. Without renouncing citizenship to the US (despite sometimes wanting to with recent events). My mother is in her late sixties, with about 2.5k USD in pension, and I have a remote job that I can work on from anywhere.

We both have passports and some savings but not a lot. I'm aware each country is different and has its own laws surrounding them. I've heard of the 90-Rule in most European countries, within 180 days, and I'm wondering if it's possible to stay say, in Sweden for 90 days, swap to Ireland for 90 days, swap to Canada for 90 days, then back again for Spain to rinse and repeat for as long as we wish until we see a place we really want to settle in the future and apply for citizenship there. (We've never been able to travel before to actually see anything.)   
  
I'm also hoping, since we're paying so much right now in the US, we'll be able to save some money. We have a joint income of about 5k monthly (I'd take a pay cut significant with WFH, unless I switched companies), but we're easily spending 3k of that on rent, and 750 on a car+insurance here. When I see rates closer to 1,800 for a 2b/2b in Sweden in a nice area with no car needed. (Not the same in Ireland, etc, etc I know. )

From very basic research, it looks doable on our current salaries. We've both struggled for many years and are very self-sufficient- so we're not the types to blow it on big outlandish hotels or resorts. But I'm curious if this is a possible idea to put time into- 3-month rotating travel arrangements to visit the countries we like while saving money, avoiding the USA, and finding a new home.... a tall order- is it possible? Am I not thinking of a law that says ""Absolutely not you strange country-hopping hobo""??   
  
I've heard of older couples going on cruises because it's easier than some alternatives, but since my mother is terrified of boats, that's off the table. We've already got our passports and we're probably going to put our things in a climate-controlled storage unit (an extra expense I know but it's better than taking it with us). I'd love to leave when our lease ends here in late August. I do also know some countries require that visa before you even go there- I'm thinking mostly countries that don't require one under the 90 days but I'd definitely check and apply before I'd jump ship from anywhere.

Idk if Taman Negara should be included tho', it seems a nice experience, but it's such a transport hassle and it also adds another accommodation to our trip. 

Itinerary summary by cities so far:

* KL 2 nights 
* Langwaki 3 nights 
* Penang 3 nights 
* Singapore 2 nights 

Should sth be added or removed?

travel,1gm0kki,Booking.com is the worst.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gm0kki/bookingcom_is_the_worst/,7,"
They booked an overbooked flight for me and charged $1,500. They then told me to reschedule my flight for two days later, which I couldn’t do. I requested a refund to my credit card, and they assured me it would appear within 7-10 business days. I waited beyond that timeframe, but when I checked my statement, there was no refund. When I called back, they said they would issue an $800 refund to my card and a $600 voucher instead, which I declined. This has been the worst customer service experience ever!",2024-11-07 20:42:26

travel,1glf61i,South East Asia 3 month itinerary check,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1glf61i/south_east_asia_3_month_itinerary_check/,8,"	Hey everyone! I'll be traveling for about 5 months this spring with three months in SEA. This is going to be my first (and likely only) long-term solo trip and I've got a lot planned. I'm planning on visiting Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. I'm worried that my itinerary is a bit too packed, although I do usually prefer to do as much as I can with the time I have.

I'm wondering if adding Indonesia is a bit too much and those days might be better allocated elsewhere. However I like mountains more than beaches and cities, and I will be hiking the three passes trek in Nepal at the end of April, so climbing mountains in Indonesia would be a good way to get into shape.

I also know I have my itinerary a lot more planned out than a lot of people, but it's somewhat necessary because I will have friends flying out to join me for some parts of the trip, so I will need to meet them at specific locations and dates.

Tldr; is this schedule way too rushed, and am I missing anything? I like mountains (especially ones I don't need to hire a guide for) and saving money

I will be travelling to Argentina soon and as I understand it there’s different kind of exchange rates in the country. When I referred to the : https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/dolar-turista-tid67475/  
I noticed different kind of rates.

1. Official Rate 
2. Informal Rate (or Blue Dollar rate)
3. Tourist Dollar Rate 
4. MEP Rate 

While I understand 1 & 2, 3 and 4 seem a bit confusing to me as I see a lot of difference in the rate between the two. As I understand it MEP is supposed to be the Visa credit card exchange rate but right now I see visa on their website mentions the rate as 1USD = 1077ARS (https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html) which is slightly below the blue dollar rate. Could anyone who frequently visits argentina help me understand this ? What is the tourist dollar rate which seems much higher then the MEP/Blue dollar rate ?

travel,1gkike3,"If traveling to the Philippines, avoid Philippine Airlines if you can. ",238,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkike3/if_traveling_to_the_philippines_avoid_philippine/,58,"Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the only airline that flys from the LAX directly to Manila. If flying from LAX, flight time to Manila is 14 hours on average. Other airlines have connections and travel time are 18 hours or more. However, direct is always not best, especially if you are flying Philippine Airlines. They are just the absolute worst. And my experience is not a one-off. This has been a recurring issue for decades that can't be addressed because, well, they are the flag-carrier of the Philippines and there's no competition.  
  
Our family of three booked a flight to Manila from LAX via Philippine Airlines, with paid and reserved seats on both legs. Flight to Manila was smooth, from the booking, check-in process until we left the airport. I was surprised because for years of flying LAX-MNL and back, I have always encountered an issue with Philippine Airlines. Issues ranging from defective seats, entertainment console, tray tables, lost baggages (with valuables, and only the baggage with the valuables gets lost every single time) etc. But this time, it was smooth. I was surprised.  
  
But PAL soon enough showed its true colors. A few days before our return flight, I got an email saying that the aircraft got downgraded from a Boeing to a smaller Airbus. As a result, they are now overbooked and looking for volunteers to be put on a different flight. Because of this, our family lost paid seats. After calling customer service, I also found out that my wife and toddler got put on a different flight and on a different day. They got put on that flight without our approval. Without any consent. 

To put them on the same flight as myself, we had to buy new seats. On top of what we already paid for previously. Ok, what's another $300 on top of our $3000 ticket right?

The night before our flight, I couldn't check-in my wife and toddler. App and website show they are waitlisted and we had to settle the issue on the counter.

Day of the flight, we arrived 4 hours early to check-in. In their system, my wife and toddler does not have a seat. The payment that we made is not reflecting in their system. They were actually in the process of putting my wife and toddler to another flight which is 3 days later. I fought it. I showed the receipt including the credit card transaction of our paid seats. Agent went inside the office and had to ask the manager to override the system. Great, we got in the flight together. We were able to go home.

But imagine if you're an elderly that does not have access to all these tools. Imagine if you are not tech-savy, or it's your first time traveling. Imagine if it's a one-way trip and all your funds are on this flight with no other means. 

As I mentioned, this is not the first time that this happened to me. When I was single and younger, I was traveling to/from LAX-MNL and this happens quite often. I always pay and reserve a window seat but most of the time I get re-assigned and placed in the middle of the middle aisle. I've submitted complaints. I've filed grievances. All I get every time is a ""We are sorry for your unpleasant experience."".",2024-11-05 21:58:29

I have been researching the best spots to see fully wild orangutans for a while now. I have gathered a lot of research, all with extremely mixed reviews, and it's very hard to know where the best place is as everyone has had such different experiences.

I am open to different formats, whether that be a jungle trek or a river or 4wd

We are mostly keen on seeing wild orangutans, proboscis monkeys, amazing plans, and other animals, as many as we can, focusing on the orangutangs 

Right now I am looking at:

\- Kinabatangan River (Borneo Malaysia) - seems to be a little more relaxed than a jungle trek going down the river but I am concerned with crowds on the boats and lots of reviews of 0 sightings of orangutans   
  
\- Gunung Leuser National Park (Sumatra) - Seems super authentic with the jungle, also have heard crowds can be a problem, also we will be going in late April, camping out overnight in the heat sounds a bit intense! but would be willing

\- Dermakot forest reserve - sounds great with the 4wd trecks however, we arent as interested in nocturnal animals like the cats, but rather the orangutans and proboscis monkeys 

\- Danum valley - Sounds quite expensive and very hard to see animals given the dense forest

travel,1glejwg,Peru: Any Organized Tours that Depart from Sacred Valley?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1glejwg/peru_any_organized_tours_that_depart_from_sacred/,6,"Question for anyone who's been to Peru, but specifically Cusco.  Planning a trip for next year but traveling with a 5 year old and I'm very concerned about potential altitude sickness in Cusco, mainly for our child.  I see many recommendations online that say to fly into Cusco and then immediately get a taxi to Sacred Valley and stay there for 2-3 days to acclimate and then do Machu Picchu and then explore Cusco last since you're supposed to work your way up to the higher elevation slowly.  My preference is to just do organized ""Viator/TripAdvisor"" style tours of Sacred Valley and more importantly Machu Picchu so that I don't have to deal with all the transportation/ticket headaches, but it seems like all of these organized day trips leave from Cusco and not Sacred Valley.  Has anyone ever done organized tours of these places that depart FROM Sacred Valley and NOT Cusco?  We don't want to have to stay in Sacred Valley and then have to drive to Cusco each time to join a tour group.  Any insight or recommendations are appreciated.",2024-11-07 01:08:24

Planning to take a 1 week solo vacation to Amsterdam/Netherlands on March 2025 during my birthday week. Anyone here have recommendations for accommodations? 

I found a few hotels so far, but would love to hear what you guys recommend for a week. I will most likely go to other nearby cities as well, however that'll most likely be a day trip (but I might decide for an overnight stay depending on itinerary)

1. Hotel Fogo (recommended by my colleague, however he stayed for only a few days)

2. Correndon Apartments Amsterdam Schipol Airport (nearby to the airport with decent prices, and with the free airport shuttle lol)

I don't have a ""huge"" budget but I don't mind spending a decent amount, since my flight will mostly be paid with my points. 

Would rather avoid hostels if possible, I stayed at a capsule hotel at Japan and while it was nice, I would rather only stay for a max of 1 night if ever.",2024-11-06 21:19:35

My family and I are heading to Brazil this January, starting in Rio (Ipanema), then to São Paulo (Ubatuba), and finally to Passa Quatro.

My dad and I are big into fishing and are hoping to find a good spot for that, but we’d love to make it a trip the whole family enjoys. My mom and girlfriend are really excited to see some wildlife (capybaras are top of the list), so we're hoping to find a tour that offers both fishing and wildlife viewing. If there’s a way to get some fishing in while also spotting animals (especially in a boat or canoe), that’d be perfect.

Does anyone know of any good guides or tours around those areas? Ideally, something that combines fishing and wildlife in a way that works for everyone. We’re looking to do a day or two of this, and eco-friendly tours would be a big bonus.

You actually take a small boat across Lake Manapouri first and then a bus over the pass where the power station is located.  We had good weather the first day, and lousy on the second, but I actually liked the bad weather better!

Every time after we completed her parents name, nationality, etc. we could click “save & continue” and it would say “this specified URL is inaccessible, please try again later.”

We searched online and tried everything. We even contacted support and everything online said: 
1) Try multiple browsers 
2) Clear cache, history, cookies
3) Try incognito mode 

We tried on multiple devices (laptop, phone) and different browsers, cleared everything, did incognito… I downloaded chrome, edge, Firefox, brave, opera, safari.. and nothing worked!!! It was sooo frustrating. 

Anyways to cut the story short, we were just hopeful that eventually something would work. But what we ended up doing is we started entering information into the application slowly (bit by bit). For example, we would put in the address, then click “save and temporary exit”. Then we’d go back into filling a partial application, and fill in more information, then click “save and temporarily exit.” We kept doing this until we figured out what glitched the system and when we clicked “save and temporarily exit” it would say “the specified url is inaccessible.” From here, we were able to figure out what caused the error and we fixed it! For ours - it was a name that caused a bug. So when we changed it, it worked. I don’t know if this would be the same for others, but if you keep pressing “save and temporarily exit” it should help you figure out what you’re typing in that causes the error message. 

I REALLY hope this helps someone else! Because we tried everything we found online, and this was our saving grace!

Best of luck!!!!

We traveled exclusively by train, bus, etc (no cars).

Wins: 

- We opted to leave the travel stroller at home, and I'm so glad we did. So many more stairs than I remember! A stroller would have been a total PITA.

- A small backpack for the 4YO full of activities (coloring, stickers, cards, games). He refused to carry it, but loved being able to do activities on trains/planes.

- 40L thule Aion: I (38 YO) was able to easily carry all my own stuff on my back, freeing my hands to pull a small rollerboard for the kiddo while holding his hand.

- I convinced Grandma to downsize to a smaller rollerboard (just a smidge larger than under seat) which made it possible for her to manage her own bags without help. 

- Toddler wore keen sneakers, which he loved. Grandma wore chaco lace up boots, also a hit. I wore leather Taos sneakers. All of us were fine with just one pair of shoes.

- Absolutely did not need a car seat for this trip. Public transport was plentiful and easy. Kids are free until 4 in France and 6 in Germany/Switzerland, too.

- We were able to be cash free almost the entire trip, but the kiddo wanted to see the miniature coin operated train at the station run. Using the little cash we did take out was fairly simple, but could have just used cards.

Losses

- Both my mom and I brought a small backpack as our personal item. We would have had an easier time with a small zippered tote (basically landscape rather than portrait orientation). I couldn't wear my backpack because I was already wearing the Thule big backpack (so I wish I had crossbody or shoulder straps). Mom lost one of the kiddo's stuffies on the first day of the trip, because her backpack came open without her realizing it.

- I carried extra shoes for the 4YO for no reason.

- A bag with spare undies in an outside bag pocket would have been a smart move.

- Lighter more packable jackets would have made life easier, especially because it turned out to be warmer than expected. Our jackets were right for only about 2 of 10 days. I carried an extra sweatshirt for the kiddo that he never wore.

- I wish I would have planned the cost of public transport a little more thoughtfully. I wonder if I could have booked day passes or other travel passes instead of point to point. I don't think we overpaid too much here, but probably a little. 

- We had one longer train ride using Deutschebahn that was booked as spar preis, but they changed the schedule about two weeks before our trip, forcing a need to rebook. I attempted to rebook from the US, but wasn't able to. It was easily corrected at the train station, and I wish I hadn't even tried to bother with it from home. 

I would do this trip again and would recommend with any amenable preschoolers.",2024-11-06 11:54:27

We'd like to go somewhere with good food, whether it be caribbean, french, etc. but don't want the tourist fare you find in cruise ship heavy areas. On the cruise ship note - we hope to avoid crowds in general, so we don't want to stay in any big areas with lots of tourists. 

Neither of us are interested in night life beyond a beach bar we can relax and have some drinks at. 

Our dream accommodation would be on or near a secluded beach with good shore snorkeling, private pool would be a bonus but not necessary. Hotel, resort, airbnb/VRBO, we are open to anyting. Hoping to keep this around $5-6k for \~ 10 days (not including air fare), which seems feasible for Roatan but we haven't found any accommodations that stand out to us.

We like good food (both high end and local/regional ""cheap eats""), history, shopping, being active (in nature or just walking around exploring city streets), watching sports (pro and college), interesting architecture and/or beautiful landscapes - Obviously, we're not expecting one city to tick ALL these boxes, but maybe a combination of a few would be nice. 

Places we've been considering are:

\- New Orleans

\- Savannah/Charleston

\- Boston

 \- Utah ""Mighty 5"" Parks - from SLC or Vegas (this would likely be a 9-10 day trip).

\- Arizona (Phoenix/Sedona/Flagstaff areas).

\- Denver (during summer months)

\- Asheville, NC was on the radar - but not sure how they're doing following the Hurricane... 

Does anyone have any opinions or maybe have any other suggestions?

My partner and I are planning a 3-month backpacking adventure through South America, and we could really use some budgeting advice. We’ve each got a budget of £3,000 (so £6,000 total for both of us) for the entire trip. Flights are already covered, so this amount is just for accommodation, food, transportation, and activities.

**Note**: In Chile and Argentina we won't be travelling below Santiago or Buenos Aires, so only north Chile and north argentina, as I don't think our budget will be enough to explore the south!

**Here’s our route:**

• **Peru**: Lima, Ica, Paracas, Huacachina, Cusco (Salkantay Trek), Arequipa, Lake Titicaca

• **Bolivia**: La Paz, Uyuni Salt Flats, Sucre, Santa Cruz

• **Chile**: Santiago, San Pedro de Atacama and some stops on our way south

• **Argentina**: Northern regions, then Buenos Aires (just briefly)

**We’re planning on:**

•Staying in hostels, budget Airbnbs, or sharing rooms to save costs

•Cooking our own meals when possible, but also exploring local cuisine

•Taking buses rather than flights between destinations, if feasible

**Questions:**

1. How should we allocate our budget across the four countries, given differences in cost of living?

2.Are there any unexpected expenses or money-saving tips for backpackers in these countries?

Any advice or experiences you can share would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-06 12:19:31

For context, we are flying first with air canada, then taking a connecting with EVA air. A few weeks ago I called air canada and customer service basically just giggled and told us we’d be fine. Then we called EVA air but they were the ones giving us an issue saying that since we booked through a third party we’d have to either risk getting denied boarding or cancel the ticket (which is nonrefundable) + a penalty fee, then rebooking. We don’t want to do this if it’s not even guaranteed denial. My bf decided to pull a Karen and asked them to escalate the situation, in which the girl said that they helped us fix it on their end, all we need to do is on the day of flying, we need to go to an Air Canada representative (since they are our first flight) to validate this change 

I want to know if anyone’s had this experience? I’ve read online that they charge a $50 fee to add ur middle name, or that they don’t even check? The $50 fee I’m fine with paying, I just don’t want to have to rebook something that will end up just taking an extra $2k out of our pockets just for 2 middle names

My name is relatively long. Let's say it's Taylortaytay Amandaqueen Swifties, so in my passport, they break it into 2 pages.

In my passport page 2 / Photo-page, name = Taylortaytay Amandaqueen (no lastname), then in page 4, it says Additional Name: Taylortaytay Amandaqueen Swifties (fullname)

In my India e-Visa application, we'd get emails when we save a page, and the system email always address me as the fullname. So I know my data entries are correct. When they asked us to upload PDF photo of our passport, I uploaded the 2 passport pages in 1 file.

**But when the e-visa is issued, the name = the first 2 words**. I suspect they only recognize the name in the photo-page (and ignores the next page where it adds my Lastname)

I'm concerned about 2 potential issues:

1. When I check-in for my flight/airline, the airline might take issue with the name difference in my visa VS in my passport/flight ticket
2. When I go through Indian immigration

Any idea if this name discrepancy is okay?

I haven't done much traveling. But I'm in my mid late 30s so no partying for me. I don't have much time to research as I normally would since I work 50 hours a week as a nurse in Canada. So I'm desperate for help.

After some researching I've done, this is what I've got. I'm looking for input to see if I should change something. I don't like to jampack my day as I like to see new things/food but also be relaxed.

\- **Food is important**. I want good food but reasonable budget. Maybe one meal a day where I'll splurge $20-40 USD and the rest of the meals for that day is light snacks (ie. pizza, bagel, etc) or something affordable. **Definitely pizza and bagels at one point.**  
\- My must sees is what I plan to see on a particular day. And the rest I'd be fine not seeing/doing if I decide day of I don't want to or I'd rather do something else.  
\- I'm staying in Midtown  
\- I'm fine walking. If it's going to take me 20 minutes to walk, I don't mind. Especially if taking the bus takes 30. I walk pretty fast. With that said.. I also don't mind paying a premium for Uber for I presume in NYC, the traffic will kill me?  
\- I'm open to paying to go up Statue of Liberty. And paying for things as I probably won't be back to NYC for a while.  
\- I've traveled once and it was to Europe. I really enjoyed museums. I tend to enjoy anything new.   
\- I want to buy a used book somewhere. I guess it doesn't really matter where. But if there's a special mention, please do so.

* Day 1 Friday
   * Arrive JFK Airport at 7am 
   * Hotel at Midtown (drop off carry-on)
   * **Times Square (my must see)**
      * Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch
      * I was thinking visit in AM first before seeing at evening?
   * **Central Park (my must see)**
   * The Met Museum
      * Maybe do this on Day 2?
   * **Saint Patrick’s Cathedral (my must see)**
   * Rockefeller Center
* Day 2 Saturday
   * **Grand Central Station (my must see)**
   * **Empire State Building (my must see)**
   * Chinatown or Korean Town
      * Is it worth it to eat somewhere here? I do love KBBQ. 
   * Union Square
      * Buy used book here? Wherever I travel, I like to buy a used book
   * **Broadway at 8pm (tickets bought)**
* Day 3 Sunday
   * **I bought tickets to watch the Giants game at 1pm. Does this day look right or should I be doing something else?** 
   * Financial Distsrict
   * 9/11 Memorial
   * **Statue of Liberty (my must see)**
      * **Going up is a must for me.** Anything I should know about?
   * Evening
      * Bar? Comedy show? Broadway show?
      * I’d like to see a dubstep show (lol). But tbh, I’d be fine not going. Considering I am going to a Broadway show already at 8pm and I’d rather sleep after Lol. I’m in my 30s.
* Day 4 Monday
   * **Brooklyn Bridge (my must see)**
   * West Village
      * Buy slice of pizza here somewhere as per my friend
   * Chelsea Market

There's a few places I haven't included as I am not sure which day to see it. I know I want to see the Rockefeller Building too but I presume that's a ""go and see and leave in 10 minutes"" or am I wrong? What else should I be adding? And what else should I be removing, in your opinion (and why)?

travel,1gkz9zd,Western Union can't tell me what is considered a valid ID (for the purpose of receiving a money transfer as cash for pickup),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkz9zd/western_union_cant_tell_me_what_is_considered_a/,15,"I asked whether they accept a temporary passport, emergency travel document, or a copy of the passport (instead of a regular passport) and they couldn't give me a clear answer.

They claim that agent stores operate independently.

Therefore every agent store independently decides what are the required documents for receiving the money transfer (in physical cash).

Customer experience:

>I've talked to Western Union Colombia and they keep insisting on my physical passport. I've lived in 13 countries and always been allowed to use a digital scan of my passport in every other country but for some reason Colombia insists on the physical document.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/17cxcsa/comment/lrnlp9t/)

Customer in Thailand:

>They wouldn't let me use a photo copy anywhere they also need a **copy of your valid entry visa stamp only from the original**.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/18mtszz/comment/lvucalf/?context=3)

>I called Western Union and they said I will just need my (Indian) passport. Remitly said sometimes (not always) depending on the pickup location, they ask for a Ecuadorian ID. In that case they said, I can have a friend accompany me to the bank and they can show their Ecuador ID and I can pick up the cash (I don’t have any friends in Ecuador at least as of today).

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1e72zzm/money_transfer_during_travel/)

>You can collect the money that has been wired to you at a Western Union, provided you have photographic ID. You should be able to collect your money using the ID you have printed and by showing your police report and embassy/consulate document.

[From this article (2018).](https://www.projects-abroad.ca/blog/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-passport-abroad/) It may be outdated or valid for a specific country or a specific WU agent store.

It's not clear what is the ""embassy/consulate"" document. Temporary passport? Or some sort of confirmation that the person declared his passport as stolen or lost?

Next, the author writes:

>Once you have received the wired money, you can head back to your embassy or consulate to purchase an [emergency passport](https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document).

So the document presented to WU is probably some sort of confirmation that the person declared his passport as stolen or lost.

The reason why this is interesting is because I would prefer to travel to countries where I can easily receive money via Western Union in case of emergency (passport and other belongings stolen).

The plan is to wire money to me via WU (before traveling)  and go to collect the cash in case I need it (my cash and credit/debit cards are stolen/lost).

I do not trust that my consulate will help me adequately. Moreover, I need to pay in advance to be issued a temporary passport (it's not a free service). So I would need to receive money somehow if I am robbed while traveling and don't have my passport.",2024-11-06 14:06:13
travel,1gkoanc,Northern Vietnam Itinerary for February ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkoanc/northern_vietnam_itinerary_for_february/,5,"Hi everyone!

We are visiting northern Vietnam February 18th through March 2nd. We are interested in experiencing the vibrant culture, seeing the countryside and beautiful scenery, and of course eating all the amazing food. We won't be driving our own motorbikes, but happy to do some bicycling and moderate hiking. We want to go at a relatively relaxed pace. We are mid-range travelers in terms of budget, mostly looking to be comfortable, but also willing to splurge a little. I've rewritten our itinerary so many times. The more I read about Hoi An and Sapa, I'm not sure we want to spend so much time traveling to them. Hoi An may be a bit too tourist trappy, and it sounds like February is not a good time of year for Sapa. So I'm now considering the following itinerary and would appreciate any insight you guys have!

Specific questions: 
1. Does this itinerary leave enough time at each place? Is there too much or too little time at any of these places?
2. Is Mai Chau a good alternative to Sapa at that time of year?
3. Is a Bai Tu Long Bay cruise recommended? We are under the impression it is a beautiful and much quieter alternative to Ha Long Bay.
4. Does it make sense to do both Bai Tu Long Bay and Ninh Binh? Will that be slightly repetitive in terms of limestone scenery and should we choose just one? 
5. Are we making a mistake skipping Hoi An, and/or Sapa?

Day 1 - Hanoi

Day 2 - Bus or van to Ninh Binh

Day 3 - Ninh Binh

Day 4 - Bus or private car to Mai Chau 

Day 5 - Mai Chau

Day 6 - Mai Chau 

Day 7 - Bus or van to Hanoi

Day 8 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise (considering Dragon Legend)

Day 9 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise 

Day 10 - Bai Tu Long Bay cruise/back to Hanoi

Day 11- Hanoi ",2024-11-06 02:37:34

travel,1gjiwa8,Luxor (Egypt),376,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjiwa8/luxor_egypt/,132,"Using a burner account to share my experience.

Past weekend, I decided to travel to Luxor from our holiday in Hurghada with my girlfriend since it was a long time dream of us to visit the capital of ancient Egypt (we're both into history).

To give you an idea on our background, we're both beginning of our 30s and have travelled to about 40+ countries together (North Africa, Latin America, South East Asia etc.). Look wise we're olive skinned Mediterranean (I'm from a Balkan country, she's mixed Spanish/Moroccan), so we're not the typical ""target"" for locals. Additionally, my girlfriend purposefully dresses down to be moderate and not draw attention and I have tall, athletic build.

Both of us have grown up with quite thick skin because of the environment where we were raised, so the poverty, hassling, negotiating prices everywhere you go, getting ripped off, etc. did not really come off as a major shock to us. However, we had an awful encounter regretting our visit to this country. 

**Story time:** During the day, we visited all the different monuments on the East Bank and, beside the usual stuff I read on Reddit happening to tourists in Egypt, nothing more happened. The hotel staff, our driver, the employees at the various tourist sites were all friendly and helpful, so far so good and a great experience for history geeks like us.

After dinner at our hotel's restaurant around 7pm, we decided to take a walk on the boardwalk near the Nile (where all the cruises are anchored). After a nice long walk, we decide to have a drink at a café on the boardwalk. At this point (9pm), there were pretty much only locals outside walking around and/or having a drink. Mostly men, so again the staring, remarks in Arabic, etc. was more than prevalent, but fine, we just ignore it to not spoil our day because there is not end to it, right? When asking for the bill a kid (aged 11-12) from a distance started to blow kisses, hearts, etc. to my girlfriend. Since it was a child, we were thinking nothing more to it than again an example of lack of education and respect which we experienced during our walks in Hurghada on a previous holiday before.

After we paid the bill, we decided to walk home the same way we came, so this same kid starts to haggle us for food, then for a drink, then eventually for money. We ignore it and keep on walking towards our hotel. We had to take a turn on a road where there was limited lighting and only cars passing by, so we kept walking and ignoring him to reach another main road when he suddenly started to run in front of us, picked up a big rock and started to shout aggressively and threatened to throw it on us. Seeing this unfold, my girlfriend panicked because my first reaction was to let go of my girlfriend and walk towards him to fuck him up when she grabbed and pushed me back reminding me that it's a minor and if I hurt him (which I was intending to do, because I was not going to let someone threaten her or me), I might end up in jail if something happens etc. So she calmed me down and urged me to walk back quickly to the boardwalk where we came from to have some people around us. And so we did. He followed us all the way back to the boardwalk, but with the rock hidden in his hoodie. I decided to talk to one of those horse carriage drivers to take us back to the hotel hoping it would solve the issue of crossing the road we need to cross to get to the hotel. All said and done, we arrive at the corner of the street of our hotel and we hop off the carriage. 

Guess what? Suddenly this kid appears again out of nowhere. Most likely he ran and chased the carriage down for nearly 1,5km.

At this point, we told the driver to call the Tourism Police and pointed to the kid out saying he chased us all the way down. The driver (after asking for a tip of course) walked us to the hotel entrance where we immediately went inside to tell the reception what was going on. The kid then walked by the entrance and when seeing that there was a guard in the entrance finally decided to give up and disappeared. Reception said they can call the police, but it would be impossible for the police to find him again since it's dark and nothing ""serious"" happened to us. Basically, it would just be a waste of time to file in a report etc. and advised us not to go walking alone by the evening again. We barely slept that night and left first thing in the morning.

I hope this experience will help anyone considering to visit Egypt to plan their trip like many suggested: **with an experienced, local tour guide who drives you around from point A to B. Do to not go on walks in the late evening by yourself thinking you'll be fine.** The harassment, hassling and uncomfortable feeling of being unsafe is multiplied by 100 when it's dark, even as a couple, so let alone for solo female travelers.",2024-11-04 16:48:23

6-9: Shuttle to and stay around Atitlan. Thinking about splitting 2 nights each in San Pedro and Santa Cruz. Want to hit some of the trails (Indian Nose, Lower Mayan, maybe San Pedro), might take a weaving workshop. Otherwise relax and explore the towns around the lake.

travel,1gkc3n0,Australia January 2025 trip advice,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gkc3n0/australia_january_2025_trip_advice/,4,"Hello, thank you in advance for reading.

I am from the UK, in my mid twenties, have been granted some leave from work and am heading to Australia for the first time between 4th and 23rd January. I am staying with my friend from Brisbane for the first five days, but then have a couple of weeks I'm unsure what to do with.

I'd have loved to visit Whitsundays, but have discovered that it is both rain and stinger season. I've therefore been thinking about WA. In an ideal world I'd perhaps head from Perth to Esperance, but I'd really like to join an 18 - 30s trip, and can't find any for this area. I have, however, found a Gap360 trip from Perth to Exmouth, which sounds fun.

I don't mind the heat (experienced Thailand in April where it was 39 degrees everyday earlier this year - not ideal but fine), I just wondered if I'm going to run into the same problems as with Whitsundays if I head up this way? (E.g. storms and stingers. I appreciate there are loads of flies and it will be hot!)

Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. I would really like to experience Australia outside of the big cities, and as it's my first solo trip the thought of joining a group for part of it really appeals... but almost all 18-30s trips are up the East Coast (where it will be wet).",2024-11-05 17:26:40

travel,1gjmg6j,Colombia Trip Report,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gjmg6j/colombia_trip_report/,11,"Recently took a trip to Colombia (with a small side quest to Panama).

Thought I'd share some of my opinons, thoughts, my itinerary as well as the costs. I took a late night flight out of London direct to Bogota, but connected to a flight to Cartagena. This was a self-transfer so I left 6 hours between flights to transfer in Bogota, which was also the cheaper option. Turns out my flight landed an hour early (2:30am as opposed to 3:30am) and customs and immigration was super efficient. but I was unable to transfer to the earlier flight at 4am and all other flights had seemingly sold out, so I just had to turtle it out in the airport and try to nap. The domestic gates are not ideal for napping, as there are some very loud announcements, though I did find a quiet corner in some gates downstairs. Theres ample water fountains and wi-fi so it turned out OK in the end.

**Cartagena - 2 Days**  
**Day 1** \- This was my first stop, dropping my bags at the hotel at 11AM, I was straight off to the city to explore. Walking around, I explored the old town, the Baluarte de Santo Domingo, City Walls and soaked in the atmosphere in some of the Plazas. Tried some Lechon which was delicious for lunch.  
**Day 2** \- I checked out Fuerte San Felipe de Barajas, then once again went back to the old town to soak in the atmosphere and walk around.

There is not much else to do here unless you're into nightlife (which I am not) or checking out some of the beautiful islands (which I do not have money to do). There was a great lively atmosphere and I understand why lots of people come here for the nightlife, though I was happy to only spend 2 days here.

**Medellin - 4 Days**  
**Day 3** \- I took an early AM flight out of CTG to MDE - I was able to roll out of bed about 90 mins before the flight as my hotel was on the airports doorstep. Arriving into Medellin, I took a bus to the city, getting dropped off behind San Diego Mall. A 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station I was able to buy my transit pass and make my way to my Hotel. Dropping off my bags, I went exploring again. Though first I had a classic Bandeja Paisa. This kind of reminded me of the much loved Full English Breakfast in the UK, so I really enjoyed it. I then checked out Museo El Castillo and Santafe Mall. I'm not typically someone who goes to malls but it was interesting seeing the sort of stores they had, and also found a great place to get Paletas in the mall. I made my way back up to my hotel, grabbing some Empanadas for dinner.

**Day 4 -** I went to Pueblito Paisa, which was an interesting first panoramic view of the city, though the ""Pueblito"" itself was fairly basic and had some replicas of old colonial style buildings. I then went to Comuna13, which was fun to see - it was vibrant and loud and interesting to make my way up as high as I could. I found a quiet spot deeper into the Comuna and watched the sunset and lights turn on over the city - it was a beautiful view. After this, I made my way all the way back down, then made the journey to another view point. This required a cable car then about half hour hike through some fairly dodgy neighbourhoods. Once I got to the viewpoint though, it was all worth it, the view was stunning.

[Comuna 13 View](https://preview.redd.it/kmf970zlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b1af3f53cfbb9602fdf2d64c9f323ee40e3be34)

**Day 5** \- I'd heard a lot about Parque Arvi, and as someone who enjoys hikes through nature I thought I'd go check it out. This was an interesting journey requiring a Metrocable journey then switching to another super long cable car journey (15 mins non-stop). I don't consider myself scared of heights but Cable Cars have always felt a bit funny to me with the way they shake and move around. The view up was worth it though, seeing the entire city from above during the day. Getting to the park itself was a bit of a let down however, theres a fairly expensive secured trail, or you can ""take the risk"" and walk on other trails but they seemed to be mostly rural roads. The weather had also taken a turn for the worse. I walked along one trail but it was so wet and slippery that I decided I'd had enough after that. I made the long journey all the way back down into the city, heading to the Parque Natural Cerro El Volador. Here I watched the sunset and again saw the night lights start to flicker on. I stayed up here for so long that a security guard came and kicked me out as it turns out the park closes at 5PM! Well worth getting chewed out in Spanish though.

**Day 6 -** Upon arriving, my hotel host insisted on a guided tour to Guatapé. It looked interesting but I kinda brushed it off as I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 100k COP on a day out. I wasn't even sure I would have time to go. I decided I'd try my luck at doing it myself. I find guided tours to be sometimes rushed, sometimes too slow - I just prefer to set my own pace. I took a bus from Terminal del Norte, which took about 2 hours to get to. It was a fun physical experience to climb the Rock of Guatape, and theres some fantastic views. I then walked to the old town which was about 40 minutes walk, and thought cute its fairly small and I had seen everything I wanted after about an hour. I made my way back to Medellin, ate a Sancocho which was delicious and then packed my bag.

[View from Top of Guatape Rock](https://preview.redd.it/el74kdylnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ced1a7330388a5fe1f3e6e9045f69c241c062ef)

Medellin was the city I was most excited to visit on this trip - I'd seen videos of the city crawling up the sides of the valley and how pretty it looks at night. I was not disappointed at all. Every night I went to a different spot to view the lights and had my breath taken away. I stayed in the El Poblado area which is gentrified but safe. I do wish I was able to spend an extra day or two here though as there was so much more I would like to see. I will be back for sure. 

**Panama City - 2 Days**  
**Day 7 -**  Took an early morning flight to Panama City. Weather here scuppered my plans, I had a stroll along the Cinta Costera down along to San Felipe and the Panama Canal Museum. San Felipe was a beautiful little colonial town, and the museum was interesting, though I was extremely unlucky in being there at the same time as a very rowdy school group.   
**Day 8 -** Second morning I was planning to hike up the Cerro Ancon Reserve, but again the weather was pretty bad and I didn't really want to be climbing a hill in the rain to potentially have a pretty cloudy and grey view. Sort of had a bit of a lie in as I was a little bit drained from the past week. Took an Uber to Panama Viejo and then another Uber to Miraflores Visitor Centre to check out the Panama Canal. This was extremely cool to see in person, though the ticket was a bit pricey. Took a bus back into the city, visiting Albrook Mall for a fast food dinner and an early night. 

https://preview.redd.it/5kd5ug14oxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25c5ba8b9fdab8ed26b7929b723c6a07e8e3f90f

I was a bit unlucky with my time in Panama - the weather was pretty bad with plenty of heavy rain, and this seemed to cause problems with the municipal sewage system because it smelt like sewage everywhere I went in the city, especially close to the coast. This also stopped my checking out Metropolitan National Park and Cerro Ancon Reserve, so I had to rearrange my plans, though I was happy I managed to get in some more rest time. Whilst I don't think I'll go out of my way to visit Panama again, with how Copa connects most of Latin America I think it is inevitable I will spend more time there in the future - hopefully with some better luck. 

**Bogota - 3 Days**  
**Day 9 -**  As usual, a morning flight, land into Bogota before lunch. Grab a bus to my hotel - though I misread somewhere that you cold use contactless card, I forgot to buy the Tarjeta Tullave but the bus driver let me on anyways. Very lucky here. There is a kiosk in the airport just at the exit to the bus stops which I completely missed. Dropped my bags at the hotel and instantly feel the altitude sickness hit me. I'm asthmatic and the shortness of breath and dizziness hit me hard. Luckily in Colombia you can purchase many medicines without a prescription, so I got some **Acetazolamide** and refilled on my asthma inhalers whilst here as they are so cheap. The medication worked fairly quickly and I was ready to get on with the rest of the day. Purchased my travel pass at the nearest Transmilenio stop I went to check out the Museo Nacional de Colombia then walked along Carrera 7 down to Plaza de Bolivar. Picked up some souvenirs and soaked in the atmosphere - there was A LOT going on. Its colourful, noisy, chaotic and I generally enjoyed it. 

[Plaza de Bolivar](https://preview.redd.it/0j7fudylnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=020214446f3283d6dc6d6b60dbf74ff44985e23a)

**Day 10 -** I was fairly fatigued on this day, I'm unsure if it was related to the altitude sickness or maybe the fact I'd been going at it full pelt for 10 days at this point. Had a lie in and then checked out the Grafiti District, Botanical Garden, Simon Bolivar Park and then Zona T. The Botanical Garden and Simon Bolivar Park weren't really too special to go out of my way for so I somewhat regret it. 

[Botanical Garden](https://preview.redd.it/it2vzzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2ab4dcfb1a28753cde7a9466584b5f5608cc076)

**Day 11 -** My last day 🙁 My flight back home was at 11PM however, so I still had the entire day. I checked out as late as I could, then headed back down towards Plaza Bolivar. My original intentions were to hike up to Monseratte, but with how I was still adjusting to the altitude, I decided to err on the side of caution and take the cable car insted. It is quite an experience being up at 10.5k feet/3k metres. The view was stunning, and you're able to see the other side which is green covered mountains. I headed back down, but unfortunately as it was a Monday, the Museo del Oro and Museo Santa Clara were closed. This is a complete oversight on my part, and had I known I probably would have flipped Day 10 and 11 around. I walked down to Plazoleta Los Martires, which I do not recommend - theres some interesting colonial architecture but the area is very very dodgy. I went back to my hotel in Zona T, had some dinner and then made my way to the airport arriving at about 9PM for my 11:30PM departure. 

[View from Monserrat](https://preview.redd.it/dcxoqzwlnxyd1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4387abdf28e22e6d743b1a4fb48ac2c1f822f0e4)

I think a lot of tourists skip Bogota because they hear bad things about it. Its dirty, theres a lot of poverty, but honestly it felt so gritty and grounded I loved it. I wish I had more time here - there are so many waterfalls and cool hikes to do in the areas surrounding the city, but I would need to fully acclimate to the altitude for that.  
Transmilenio has to be the most complicated Transit system I have ever used. When first seeing the map I thought the colours referred to individual lines, but they refer to ""trunks"" and bus routes operate down a combination of these different trunks. The majority of buses also do not serve all of the stops on the trunks, so you need to know which bus route to get. With so many buses operating along these trunk routes, the buses stop at different points along the platform. Some of these bus platforms are so long that there is only a matter of 20-30 metres in between the individual bus stops in some places. Once you get the hang of things it kind of makes sense ? But even Google Maps gets confused and seems to completely avoid integrating the BRT routes into transportation options in the city. Instead, you have to use Moovit, which whilst it gives you directions, sometimes doesn't offer the most efficient routes and is also plagued with adverts. The last thing I want to do when referencing my directions is have my phone out in the open for another 5-10 seconds waiting for this ad to finish. 

**Overall thoughts:**

I'm a very fast paced traveller. I get bored in one place too easily if I'm there for too long. My time was limited by work and Annual Leave requirements. I do not really get easily exhausted from taking flights, and do not consider it a chore/tedious. I know a lot of people seem to consider needing to dedicate a whole day to travelling, but in my opinion, if your trip is fairly short then you can afford to spend the energy travelling in the morning and then exploring in the afternoon. I also have a lot of stamina - I walked on average 25k steps a day for the whole trip. My shoes soles wore out pretty brutally. A lot of what I walked could easily have been Uber'd if a bit more pressed for time, but I really enjoy soaking up the neighbourhoods as I go between places. 

I'm lucky in the sense that I'm ethnically ambiguous and able to blend in to a wide variety of countries. I'm not Latin American but I have frequently been mistaken for a local in Mexico, and now, Colombia - with museum staff asking me for my local ID so I can get the national rate, then me having to inform them I am a tourist. This fact helped me blend in when walking through some dodgier neighbourhoods, as well as not get approached by tourist traps (tour guides, souvenir sales people). Colombia is a very diverse country and I think many people could pass as a local with the right mannerisms.

A basic command of Spanish is needed. Many hospitality staff I interacted with did not speak English, even at museums and hotels - I did stay at 2 or 3 star hotels. I don't speak Spanish, though I am Filipino and our language has a heavy % of Spanish loan words. That, along with the fact I speak French (a related Romance language) helped me navigate Spanish signage as well as communicate some of my ideas with the locals. I know enough Spanish phrases to get by, but regret not investing more time in learning Spanish to connect with locals, many of whom were up for a conversation. I also made sure to have Spanish downloaded on my Google Translate app for a last resort in some situations.

Honestly, I think I fell in love with Colombia and its people. I want to have a better command of Spanish next time, instead of fumbling around the language like a toddler.

travel,1gka51v,Indonesia Itinerary - Sanity Check,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gka51v/indonesia_itinerary_sanity_check/,2,"Hi All! We, a couple in our mid 30s, are doing a 20 day trip in Indonesia. It's last minute, end of November and early December. We have our international flights booked, but nothing else. We are flying in and out of Bali (flights were cheapest, we did look at multiple options, including multi-way). We have both been to Bali before, but a long time ago. We are keen to see and do as much as possible but maybe we are taking on too much?

Day 1 - 24hr journey  
  
Day 2 - Arrive 00:30 Denpasar  
  
Day 3 - uluwatu beach and recover from long journey  
  
Day 4 - uluwatu, **maybe do a road trip, or anything else that is not too tiring on one of these days?**  
  
Day 5 - uluwatu,   
  
Day 6 - Travel to Ijen - 4hr bus/1hr ferry/1.5hr taxi! **Maybe break this up by traveling up to near Gilimanuk on day 5? Hotel could arrange pick-up. I know Gilimanuk is not very nice but Banjuwedang looks good?**  
  
Day 7 - Climb Ijen with tour, midnight/1am start! Back at hotel around 8-9am to travel 1.5hrs to catch the 11:00 train to Probowangi, arrive 15:06, 1.5hr journey to Cemoro Lawang, arriving around 5pm! LONG day. We'll probs arrange a taxi to avoid waiting for a mini-bus to fill/avoid all the scams and hassle. I have a couple of quotes and I know it will cost more but we will have had a super long day.  
  
Day 8 - 3am wake up when we're already shattered. **Is this mental?** Sunrise viewpoint, caldera, sea of sands all self-guided. We want to avoid the jeeps and tours in general, **although it seems to make sense for Ijen due to logistics?** After Bromo we have three train options, 11:30am from Probolingo arrives Yog 20:30 on economy train. 15:10 from Probolingo but arrives Yog **22:30** which we want to avoid as that's a very late arrival. Or 14:55 **from Malang** which arrives Yog 20:30. So ideally we would want to get the Malang train as this allows us more time in Bromo but still arrives in Yog around 20:30. It's also an executive train so we could rest better on the train rather than the 11:30 economy from Probolingo. **But it seems all transport to Malang from Cemoro Lawang actually goes on the toll road via / close to Probolingo? Is there no way to get across to Malang from Cemoro Lawang with luggage? Google maps shows it can be done in 2hrs or so but I believe this is not true? Is that because of all the jeeps blocking the road, or the sea of sands/entrance fee? Or the road is not actually a road at all? Is it simply not possible? Anyone know or done this journey? If it is not possible, do you think we could make the 11:30 train from Probolingo if we pre-arranged our transport? How rushed would Bromo be without a tour? Sounds like it is about 3hrs of walking. Maybe do-able with a moped across the sea of sands? Could we get back to be ready to leave the hotel for 9.30am latest?  As out of season, maybe no need to book the train? Then if it all feels too rushed we could just go for the later Probolingo train or even the Malang train?**

Day 9 - arriving late the night before, staying somewhere central in Yog, lie in and do one of Prambanan or Borobudur. Probs do Prambanan as only 30min taxi from central Yog. **Maybe get a 1hr taxi from central hotel to a hotel near Borobudur, that same evening? Means don't need to be up so early the next day for Borobudur, and avoids having to go back to yog before going to the airport?**

Day 10 - Either a short or long taxi to Borobudur depending on where we stay, will likely miss the sunrise but also miss the hoards of people on tour. Taxi to airport for a 17:45 flight to Lombok. **Maybe we should build a rest-day in here and travel to Lombok the following day and take-off a night in Lombok.** I know it's a twat thing to say - wouldn't be if I said I wanted to swim and it's just a sport - but I'm quite keen to play a round of golf in Indonesia and there is a course near Borobudur. 

Day 10-14 - Lombok. Potter around on a Moped (I've read up on IDP/insurance/legalities etc). Waterfalls, beach, maybe golf, recover from all of Java basically. Roads seem good but everywhere is like 1.5hrs driving. **Where best to base ourselves, Senggigi? Or stay on ""secret"" gillis and just veg out? We won't have it in us to climb Rinjani, but could we do a walk with views without full camping trek? Any recommendations?** 

Day 15 - Fly back to Bali and then immediately fly to Labuan Bajo all in same day. Looked at ferry and flight options but can't rely on ferry with island time or rough seas. Flights seem less likely to get cancelled, still, will be a difficult day with maybe 1.5hr taxi to Lombok airport, 1hr flight to Bali, waiting around in airport, 1.5hr flight to LB, 20minute boat or taxi to hotel from LB. Also looked at 4D3N trips to Komodo from Lombok but can't trust this with weather/horror stories and too old to be stuck on a dodgy boat with gap year students and too poor to do it private and premium. 

Day 15-20 Flores. Stay in one place and do the 2D1N Komodo tour. Seems to be best as longer is too long for us trapped on dodgy boat and day trips will be too rushed considering it's like a 3hr journey from LB. I've read the advice about sorting that out there and checking out the boats etc.

Day 20 - fly to Bali to catch a 1am flight. **Is it too risky to take an internal flight on the same day as our international, the flight is not till 1am, so I'm thinking we just don't get the last flight out and then any cancellations we should still be able to get on a later flight? Or should we have one final night in Bali? Maybe stay Sanur?**

I know that travel will take a lot longer than what google maps shows, and even if we pre-book and overpay for private transport there will be lots of delays and maybe even cancellations, especially as it's rainy season. So is what we are attempting crazy? Or is it doable? On a side-note, we also looked at getting somewhere less travelled, like Sumba or Sulawesi or even Raja Ampat but all seemed too logistically difficult/or too expensive, or just not enough going on (?). Ideally we would like to see the big main events like Bromo and Borobudur but also have some relaxation somewhere less crowded / polluted than Bali, but also has good standard hotels/restaurants and things to do, hence why Lombok seemed like a decent bet.   
  
**Maybe we don't book our hotels/internal flights until like 2-3 days before along the way so we can remain flexible? We're out of season. Is that recommended? Prices don't seem to have moved for internal flights and there are lots of hotel options with availability everywhere I have checked. What about trains?** 

Sorry this turned into such an essay and inner monologue, and thank you so much for helping me. 

TLDR, are two night climbs in a row and multiple days of trains planes and automobiles completely mental? Is Bali, Java, Lombok, Flores too much for 20 days?

Hey y’all 👋 I need some advice on which tour company to go with. Planning to travel end of November. After some digging I’ve shortlisted Nomadders, Be’s Home, Bibi, and Flipside. Within these I’m leaning towards nomadders & Be’s home mainly because they are small groups 8 people tops and no party, also their routes are focused on culture, local villages. Their accommodations are clean and private too unlike other big groups which I read.

Is it realistically possible to book hotel rooms/resort rooms at this age? (legally of course). I intend on calling places but someone pointed out that places who do allow people under 18 may not be safe. Is it still possible?

Since we won't be able to rent a car, I'm also wondering if it's still possible to get food and everything by other means so by walking or taking public transportation.

Lastly, I know that Miami is known for parties and I wanted to know if it was still safe for minors. We obviously don't intend on drinking or anything, but I feel like everything will be less accessible to minors.

My friends don't seem worried about any of these things so I wanted external advice.

We (husband & wife, early 40s, decently well-traveled) recently returned from two weeks (Oct. 11 - 27) in this area of Europe and I thought I would report back on our trip. We have been to Italy (Naples, Rome, Orvieto, Florence, Pisa, Cinque Terre, and Bologna) but not Venice or Milan, and this was our first time to both Slovenia and Switzerland.  This trip was MUCH less structured than our typical trips – most of our schedules were open for simply exploring these places on foot.  I researched all of our destinations but we had very little purchased/scheduled in advance.  I’m happy to answer any questions about likes/dislikes or what we felt we did right/wrong.

3 nights/2.5 days in Ljubljana, which absolutely charmed the hell out of us.  Unbelievably friendly people, incredible food, fantastic wine, and just the best vibes.  We stayed in Old Town (our hotel was a 4^(th) floor walkup with a great view of the river, spacious in terms of European hotel rooms, budget-friendly, perfect location, with helpful and kind staff).  We pretty much just walked around the city, eating and drinking and taking photos, for 2.5 days.  Made friends with a wonderful bartender who recommended Vintgar Gorge.  Visited Ljubljana Castle, climbed the tower for beautiful views.  Peeked inside a church or two, did a little shopping, and did a Slovenian wine tasting with a great sommelier who really knew her stuff.  Picked up several bottles of wine to drink as we made our way through the rest of the trip (and one to bring home).

2 nights/2 days at Lake Bled.  This was the only portion of the trip during which we rented a car.  We wanted the flexibility to explore outside of Bled on our own schedules.  Truly beautiful.  Quite touristy (which we expected… touristy places are touristy for a reason!)  Ate more good food, drank more good wine.  Visited Bled Castle and took a boat out to the island.  Rented an apartment just across the street from the lake.  Spent a few hours hiking at Vintgar Gorge, which was stunning (and not a difficult hike).  Well worth it!

2 nights/2.5 days in Venice.  Returned the car in Ljubljana and took a shared van (GoOpti) from Ljubljana to Venice.  We looked at taking a train, but it would’ve doubled the transit time from 3 hours to 6.  GoOpti was affordable and efficient – highly recommend.  (Though a bit crowded with nine people in a nine passenger van).  Venice was incredible.  I did not expect to enjoy it as much as we did.  I expected the entire place to be crawling with people, but that was really only true around St. Mark’s Square.  Off the main area, we just wandered quiet alleys and ate cicchetti and drank spritzes.  The only organized thing we did in Venice was take the elevator up to the top of St. Mark’s Campanile where the views were incredible.  We purchased two day transit passes so that we could use the water buses, but mostly we walked everywhere.  Venice is unbelievably walkable.  We did take a water bus out to San Giorgio Maggiore at night to see the city lights.  Beautiful.  We otherwise didn’t get off the island.  Oh, we did do a gondola right which I was iffy about, but it was definitely one of those “you have to do it once” things and we really had fun.  Fantastic food all over Venice – only had one meal that didn’t wow me (duck ragu).

3 nights/2.5 days in Milan.  Took an evening train, leaving Venice after dinner, to Milan.  Our apartment was super neat – a sixth floor place with a private balcony with a fantastic view of the Duomo.  Even though we planned this trip just three weeks out, we were able to get tickets to see the Last Supper (that said, we had to pay several hundred for a guided tour, rather than just the 15e entry fee, because those sell out months in advance).  It was worth the money, though.  We visited Sforza Castle and saw Michelangelo’s unfinished Pieta, which was amazing.  If you’ve been to Florence and have seen his ‘hall of prisoners’ at Accademia, it’s similar to those.  Astounding.  We did the timed ticket elevator to the Duomo rooftop and that was insane.  So cool to see the Duomo in various states of aging/repair, and to see all the intricate details up close.  The exit from the rooftop spits you out right inside the Duomo so it was super nice to get to skip the entry line for the interior, too.  Highly recommend that route.  We didn’t have a single bad meal in Milan.  I know it’s not a city that’s well known for food, but everything we had was wonderful.  We aren’t big shoppers so we did not do any shopping in Milan, including at any of the very high fashion places. 

3 days/3 nights in the Lauterbrunnen Valley.  We left Milan early and took a train to Lauterbrunnen, arriving by lunchtime.  I waffled about where to stay, but ultimately decided Lauterbrunnen would be the most convenient (I feel like that was the right decision for us).  Took the trains to Wengen, Grindelwald, and Murren (cable car).  Did the small hike up/behind Staubbach Falls, then walked a long way to take the cable car to Murren.  One of the most beautiful walks of my life.  Glad we skipped the bus for most of that route.  Our hotel in Lauterbrunnen was fantastic.  We had a balcony with a view of the falls, and a window with a view of the river/valley.  Breakfast was included and was generous and delicious!  It was foggy when we went to Wengen and Gridelwald.  Very clear skies when we went to Murren.  Grindelwald was by far the most touristy of the villages we visited, but we still enjoyed it.  We even played a round of mini golf while drinking Swiss beers.  So much fun.  This whole area blew our minds – it was just insanely beautiful.

1.5 days/2 nights in Geneva.  Geneva was nice.  It’s a functioning, bustling city.  Old Town is really pretty.  We had a couple of really good meals, walked along the river front area, visited outside the UN headquarters.  Lots of walking and looking around.

What visa to ask for?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk4f8x/invited_to_film_festival_in_india_what_visa_to/,10,"So in this sense, nobody is really helpful. The festival directs me to the embassy, the embassy cannot advice what type of visa I need, they have an agency or partner for visas. And then it gets messy and definitely can't see proper information about being invited for three days for a film festival.

Should I just ask for a regular tourist E-Visa? But then are they gonna inquiry much at the customs? Yes, sir, I'm sightseeing for three days after a 20h flight (this doubt is the only reason I don't jump straight away to get this visa now).

I asked the person from the embassy if I should just avoid hassle and get the tourist e-visa and she said it's a personal preference.

Should I ask for a Conference visa or Conference E-Visa? I can´t find anywhere if a film festival qualifies for that.  Conference visa is subjected to scrutiny and security clearance, which seems an overcomplication for a festival where we are gonna talk just about films and entertainment. Also I fear the processing time for this. The festival is sponsored by the government.

All advice is much appreciated.",2024-11-05 11:20:58

me and my best friend are planning to visit Kenya in January. The question is: how safe is Nairobi? 
We are not planning to do a lot in Nairobi, as the main reason to visit is Safari. Is it safe to use iPhone in Nairobi? What about safety in Diani beach and Mombasa? And also would like to ask advices about where to go in Nairobi.

travel,1gk3evf,Philippines: Do I Need to Submit DSWD Requirements if I Book a Flight as a Minor but Travel as an Adult?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk3evf/philippines_do_i_need_to_submit_dswd_requirements/,3,"Hi! I’m currently a minor but will turn 18 in the last week of November. My brother is planning a trip to Hong Kong for us in December and wants to book the flight now to take advantage of lower rates. Since I’ll be of legal age by the time of the trip, we’re unsure if I still need to complete DSWD travel requirements for minors, even though the booking would happen while I’m still under 18. Do I still need to submit the requirements if he books the flight while I’m still a minor but will travel when I’m of legal age?

travel,1gk739z,Bachelor weekend in Lisbon,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gk739z/bachelor_weekend_in_lisbon/,4,"Hi,

We are a large group of 15 (mostly French) guys going to Lisbon for a weekend during the last 2 weeks of November. I haven't been to Lisbon so looking for recommendations for restaurants (fun ones), bars, clubs and night itenaries. We are in our mid-30s so while we can still party we also need some comfort. Typically, we would start at a fun restaurant (rooftop bar?) and then hit the bars (bar hopping maybe) and end up at a club. But we also don't mind having the party dictate where we go. Given that we are 15 guys and are in our mid-30s we want to avoid being rejected at the door. So we probably need to make some reservations. I'm also open to other fun suggestions (boot tour with drinks? Football game? etc.). Thanks so much in advance and looking forward to visiting Lisboa.",2024-11-05 13:49:26

My main priority is a coastal that'll be warm as possible for that time of year. DR/Jamaica/Bahamas are off the table. 

PDC was my top choice, given the all-inclusives and array of activities we can get also go explore like cenotes, ruins, nature parks, downtown PDC, etc. However, I've already been to Mexico three times, so I'm also thinking of maybe exploring alternatives and Hawaii came to mind. Curacao also looks interesting, and I wouldn't mind going back to St Martin/Maarten (went earlier this summer on a cruise stop). 

I also have family flying in from both both the east and west coast, so I'm mindful of travel costs (trying to keep all-in price to <$2k/pp for travel+split room). Thoughts? ",2024-11-05 02:25:52
