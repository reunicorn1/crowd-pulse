Android,1gmoy7y,private space doesn't seem to add a lot of security for banking apps,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gmoy7y/private_space_doesnt_seem_to_add_a_lot_of/,24,"Banking apps on mobile often rely on fingerprint biometrics for reasonably-easy mobile  login.   Before private space, if someone gets my phone, they still need at least fingerprint to get into the banking app (and maybe fingerprint twice if my phone itself was locked when they got it). 
  
I was hoping that private space could improve security in that situation by requiring attacker to bypass 2 diverse barriers if he gets my phone:  

1. thief should have to enter a pin to get into private space

1. thief should have to enter fingerprint to log into the banking app within private space.

But if I enable biometrics to be used within private space, then biometrics can also be used for entering private space.  So the attacker needs fingerprint twice to get into my banking app...  but if he can figure out how to bypass fingerprint once then he can surely figure out  how to do it twice and it's not a heckuva lot safer than how it was prior to private space where fingerprint was needed once in this scenario.  Sure I can try to make sure my phone is locked when thief gets it, but for me that means locked with fingerprint.  It is not practical to have to enter pin every time I myself want to unlock my phone so I can't add that as a barrier for routine unlocking the phone. 

And if I disable biometrics to be used for private space, then I cannot even use biometrics to get into my banking app inside the private space. I need a big clunky password and 2fa... which is way too much trouble for routine use on mobile. 

**.... so neither enabling nor disabling biometrics for private space gives the desired 2-diverse-barrier behavior descrbed above. Am I missing something?**

Assuming I'm not misunderstanding something, then I think google really needs to separate the settings for using biometrics within private space and using biometrics for getting into private space. (so I can allow biometrics used within private space without allowing it to be used for entering private space).",2024-11-08 18:07:53
Android,1gmtbpj,Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold SE: A China-Exclusive Innovation Strategy or Missed Global Opportunity?,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gmtbpj/samsungs_galaxy_z_fold_se_a_chinaexclusive/,13,"Samsung's recent decision to launch the Galaxy Z Fold SE exclusively in China and South Korea carries interesting implications. This move suggests that Samsung is capable of producing a foldable device with a slimmer form factor and a wider cover screen, meeting the demands for a more practical design—yet they have only chosen to release it now, and only in these two markets.

Why China and South Korea? While we can only speculate, one likely reason is the intensifying competition from Chinese phone manufacturers. Many of these brands are setting new standards in foldable technology, offering wider cover screens and sometimes even more premium designs. To stay competitive in these regions, especially in China’s dynamic market, Samsung likely felt pressured to introduce a product that could stand against local offerings. Thus, the SE variant seems tailored to meet specific regional demands, showcasing Samsung’s adaptability in response to market pressures.

Should consumers in other regions feel frustrated? Perhaps, for two main reasons. First, Samsung has restricted access to this improved design, offering it only to select markets. Second, this move seems to reveal Samsung’s strategy of incremental innovation. The company appears to be reserving features, like a wider cover screen, for future models (Z Fold 7, Z Fold 8), potentially prolonging the rollout of advancements to maintain steady sales growth. This strategy raises questions about whether Samsung prioritizes business interests over delivering the best possible product for all markets.

Meanwhile, China is shifting the global tech landscape by driving rapid innovation. Chinese manufacturers have resisted the trend of releasing minor updates each year and are instead offering significant, cutting-edge advancements in new models. This approach contrasts with practices commonly seen in the U.S. and South Korea, where companies often make small, iterative changes annually. As a result, China’s influence in the market is growing, and it is setting an expectation for meaningful upgrades, which may ultimately reshape global consumer preferences.

Off the top of my head:

Xiaomi
Poco
Vivo
Redmi
Realme
Oppo
Red Magic
Asus
Huawei
ZTE
OnePlus

Android,1gk1z88,Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gk1z88/oukitel_c53_budget_phone_first_impressions/,4,"I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https://oukitel.com/products/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).

First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.

However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.

**Small issues**

There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.

The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the ""Force full GNSS measurements"" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.

**Overall impression**

I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone.

While Apple users are out there sipping lattes and reading real-time voicemail transcriptions thanks to iOS 17, we’re still dialing voicemail like it’s 2005. It’s time we ask Google one simple question: “Bro, where’s our Live Voicemail feature?”

Picture this: Apple drops a bomb with Live Voicemail – no carrier drama, no painful holds, just instant transcriptions right in the Phone app. Basically, the kind of voicemail experience that makes sense in 2024. Meanwhile, we Android users are here, refreshing Gmail or praying for decent carrier signal just to check a missed call.

Now, Google gave Apple a solid lecture on RCS, so how about we turn the tables and say, “Nice feature Apple’s got there, huh, Google?” Let’s get all of us tweeting, messaging, skywriting – whatever it takes – until Google gets us a Live Voicemail feature. After all, if Google wants to mock iOS, at least let’s give them something worth bragging about.",2024-11-04 17:00:59

Failing that route, can I use Private Space as a sort-of work profile? Are the apps in PS sandboxed so they can't interact with the other system-installed apps? Like, if I installed Teams in there, would it be able to gather any other information about anything else installed or going on on the phone at the time? Also if anyone has any tips on how to activate that work profile without going through someone at work, that'd be cool too.

(There's this page: [https://www.android.com/enterprise/work-profile/](https://www.android.com/enterprise/work-profile/) \- which seems to be a full-featured demo of the work profile, in that it installed a bunch of apps and gave me a work profile.

Android,1ghj5on,A Blast from the Bluetooth Past: Discovering the Power (and Perils) of Android,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ghj5on/a_blast_from_the_bluetooth_past_discovering_the/,5,"My recent transition from iOS to Android has been an eye-opening experience. The level of customization and user control offered by the Android platform is truly remarkable, a stark contrast to the closed ecosystem I was accustomed to.

This became especially evident when I recently unearthed a relic: a 2011 Xperia mini. This barebones device lacked a file browser and most modern functionalities. My initial attempt at sideloading apps via ADB proved unsuccessful. However, a forgotten solution emerged – Bluetooth. Connecting my modern Fairphone 5 5G to the Xperia, I was pleasantly surprised to see the older phone recognized as a peripheral device. This facilitated seamless file transfer, a capability I hadn't anticipated. While the transfer speed was undeniably slow, the experience triggered a wave of nostalgia, taking me back to a time when Bluetooth file sharing was the norm.

Beyond its historical connection, the experience solidified my appreciation for the versatility of Android. The platform seamlessly integrates with tools like Gemini, which I used to write a significant portion of this text. This functionality persists even when utilizing a custom ROM like LineageOS on a device like the Fairphone 5 5G, showcasing the depth of Android's capabilities.

While the name ""Android"" may not be the most conventional, its functionality and user empowerment are undeniable. This experience has certainly reinforced my decision to explore the Android ecosystem. Unlike iOS, Android offers a level of control and customization that empowers users to tailor their experience to their specific needs.

However, this power comes with a learning curve. As a recent convert, I've already encountered my fair share of stumbles. There was the time I attempted to disable the com.android.packageinstaller service, as I preferred using a third-party app manager with root access to install apps. This app manager offered more detailed information about the APKs I was installing, allowed me to opt out of additional language packages, and even scanned apps for potential tracking and malware using VirusTotal.
Unfortunately, disabling the package installer proved to be a fatal mistake, as LineageOS requires it to boot properly. This unexpected behavior still puzzles me to this day. While it was a frustrating setback, it highlighted the intricate nature of the Android system and the potential consequences of tinkering without a full understanding of the underlying components.

Despite this hiccup, I remain captivated by the endless possibilities that Android offers. The ability to personalize my device and delve deeper into its functionalities has been incredibly rewarding. While there's always a risk of encountering unexpected issues, the learning experience and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges are well worth it.

The Android ecosystem extends far beyond smartphones and tablets. It's a versatile platform that powers a wide range of devices, from smartwatches to virtual reality headsets.

My recent foray into the world of Android has been nothing short of exhilarating. The level of customization and user control offered by the platform is truly remarkable. I've been particularly impressed by the seamless integration of Android across various devices. My Quest 2 VR headset, for instance, runs on a modified version of Android, providing access to a vast library of VR experiences.
Furthermore, the ability to install Android as a desktop operating system alongside Windows and Linux opens up a world of possibilities. This level of flexibility and customization is unparalleled in other mobile operating systems.

While there's a learning curve associated with mastering the intricacies of Android, the rewards are substantial. The freedom to tailor the system to one's specific needs and the opportunity to explore the depths of its functionality make it a truly empowering platform.

Android,1gfdro8,Combining Dynamic Island and Dynamic Spot is the best way to do floating notifications,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gfdro8/combining_dynamic_island_and_dynamic_spot_is_the/,6,"As a Xiaomi user, I'm not sure if this applies to all current Android skins, but the floating notifications are intrusive 99% of the time. I don't like the way that they auto-expand and take up a ton of screen real estate when I don't even want to read a message or notification yet (hence mostly disabling them, and just in case other people are around). Similar concept with bubbles where I don't like them constantly being on my screen, and I'd rather be in the in-app UI because I'll be opening the app anyway to read and reply.

What I am interested in a lot of the time though is who the notifications are from, and from there I'd know if I want to read it or open it right away. The way that the Dynamic Spot app executes this is perfect in my opinion. When I get a message, I have it set to move out from my camera cutout to show the profile picture and app icon. This also works for my Twitter notifications and shows YouTube and Spotify thumbnails as they're playing, with a nice colored visualizer animation that really sets the tone. Add that to things like alarms, timers, other media players, and calls and you really have a formula to make floating notifications unintrusive (by keeping it in the status bar), functional, and visually pleasing. One of the best parts is that if there's nothing happening, you don't have a huge black bubble and it all goes back to a normal screen. Another is that you can choose whether you want the small island to auto-expand, and if not, easily tap to expand with options such as mark as read, reply, and control media. It's all so convenient and visually pleasing, which is something that's a bit lacking in just using the notification shade. I love the way that it uses the already black area of your screen and turns it into a living, breathing part of your phone (like iOS does). It also makes it easier to directly focus on and access one particular thing with just a tap rather than multiple swipes.

While a lot of people call the iOS Dynamic Island gimmicky, I believe that it definitely has its uses such as timers, indicators, and pleasing animations, and combining that native implementation with the features, execution, and customization of Dynamic Spot would truly elevate it to something great on Android that makes a previously useless feature (for me) into my favorite way notifications are delivered. I know that they'll be implementing something similar in future Android versions with the pill, but I think the way it expands and blends with the camera is really a great way to do it, and I wouldn't mind copying it from iOS.",2024-10-30 03:43:51

Why do two devices— capable of WiFi direct and in close proximity— need a third device— more likely to be farther away— to determine the speed of the sharing?

Introducing a WiFi network into a file sharing process as a medium allows its signal strength, quality, and resulting speed to control the speed of the sharing between two devices. And not to forget that those two devices — the receiving device and the sharing device — are always going to be closer to each other than to any WiFi Router/AP/WiFi Repeater that is connected to those devices.

We are tired of playing the wondering game whether the sharing speed will be decent enough to get the job done or would it be slow as a snail forcing us to think to cancel it at 10% after 2 minutes for sharing 5 pics of around 20mb & using a different sharing method.",2024-10-29 05:20:05

Given custom rom seems to be an even smaller community (some custom roms may only have 3-4000 people max inferring from number of downloads or views from XDA) and most users are unlikely tech savvy enough to audit the code, isn't that quite a dangerous thing?

Not just from programmer himself but on the security side bootloader is unlocked and phone is likely rooted. Seems that the chance of being compromised is just so high. Even if you put banking or any sensitive app to another device, it is not entirely foolproof as they may still have access to your email + Google sign-in authenticator, cookies, etc.

Recently, they expanded their lineup by introducing a 5G projector tablet, which really caught my eye. The idea of a tablet that doubles as a projector could open up so many possibilities—especially if they can keep the performance high and the design portable.

For those who've tried their projector phones, how has your experience been? Do you think 8849’s projector quality will hold up on a larger tablet screen? And with 5G built-in, I'm curious if it could enable seamless streaming for presentations, movies, or gaming on the go.

My biggest question is whether the tablet form factor will make projector tech more practical or if it might face the same battery and brightness challenges as the phones. It could be a game-changer for both work and entertainment—imagine having a mini theater setup anywhere you go!

I’ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it’s easy to switch between the two.

2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!

3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google’s Circle to Search feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgOP6XMAAQHEb?format=jpg&name=large) to OnePlus phones, finally.

4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.

5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  

6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.

7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.

8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). 

AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.

9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It’ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.

10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it’ll basically let you ask questions like “how much is my next phone bill?” and then it’ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.

OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing…but honestly it seems like it’s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently? In any case, your OnePlus phone now has Android’s Theft Protection feature, so go turn ‘em on.",2024-10-24 15:24:09

Maybe Android Debug Bridge as backup tool? It used to be one - but then they invented the ""App Manifest"" and the app knows better than me that I don't need backup of app data - so there is a flag to disallow app data backup.

The best thing that might happen with Android theoretically - some vendor offering ROM which just makes  the backup with ADB, not looking for the flag ""allow backup"". But I have seen none so far.

I was stuck in ""RCS setup"" limbo for weeks, tried every trick in the book, and was about to give up. Turns out, Verizon has a sneaky ""feature"" on their business accounts that **blocks RCS by default**.

**The Fix:**

1. Contact your Verizon business account admin.
2. Have them log into the account dashboard.
3. There's a setting called ""Block RCS"" (or something similar). **Make sure it's turned OFF.**

Boom! RCS instantly connected for me after that. Hope this saves someone else the headache I went through.

Android,1g954e3,Water damaged OnePlus Open miraculously works almost flawlessly 4 months later,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1g954e3/water_damaged_oneplus_open_miraculously_works/,2,"So, back in June I got a OnePlus Open. First foldable. Love it. $1600. 

One month later in July, I decide to go swimming with it in my pocket for about 10 secpnds. Thought, ""It'll be fine, phones are pretty tough these days."" This was a foldable. Foldables are not tough these daya.

So the day goes by and I stupidly use it before it gets professionally dries. Seemed fine at first, no defects. Then the outer screen goes out. Then the battery started draining rapidly. Then it would only stay on for a bit with wildly inaccurate battery readings, then it wouldn't turn on at all. Just a flashing out of power indicator on the screen. 

So I take it to the repair shop to replace the screen and battery. Parts are impossible to buy for this phone, so I send it to OnePlus for repair.

1 month later I get an email ""We're sorry, there's nothing we can do as the water damage is too severe. Here's a 10% off cpupon.""

I have them ship it back to me, defeated and sad. I get a new slab Samsung phone and eat my loss.

I leave the broken phone in the box they sent it in for 4-5 months. And two days ago, I finally opened it to throw it away. ****bzzzt**** ... It vibrated. Dead battery logo. I rush over to plug it in. Still didn't boot, but still have the logo. 2 minutes later, I unplug it and try the power button one more time. ****bzzzt**** .... OnePlus logo, loading animation, lock screen.

I have now been using this phone for 3 days. Of course the outer screen is still fried, and the phone only charges to 65% and hard stops there consistently but I still get like 5 hrs SOT (The phone has two batteries so I think the smaller one died completely.) I'm astonished. How does a phone miraculously heal itself of water damage?",2024-10-22 00:20:53

Hi everyone! After 7 months of hard work during my free time, I'm excited to announce the launch of my first app, \*\*RapidSubs\*\*! It's an AI-powered app that makes adding subtitles and captions to your videos super easy. I’ve built it using Expo with no UI libraries. I use speech to text AI combined with FFMPEG to create the final output videos. If you have any questions about the process feel free to ask me in the comments! As a student, this project started as a fun side project and turned into something I’m really proud of. So I’m very happy to be able to share it with you all! I'd love any feedback or questions about the development process.

Going from the 6 to the 9 though, I can't say I've enjoyed the investment. Besides some additional AI features, the phone to me doesn't really differ from the day-to-day usability.

It's actually kind of worse. The adaptive brightness is a pita. The feature says it learns your brightness preferences, but either this doesn't work or it is incredibly slow at doing so; the phone is constantly too dark. Additionally, the Extend Unlock features aren't reliable.

I have paired a garmin vivoactive 5 to the 9 and I am constantly being asked to unlock my device with additional security steps. The location-aware settings don't appear to reliably work either because I have to unlock it at home. All of this is within 4 hours of unlocking the phone given these situations.

Connectivity wise, I also found the bluetooth connection to the car isn't as smooth as it was with the 6. It almost feels like applying the phone to my every day use got a ton more manual compared to the 6 and it's really annoying.

The battery life is pretty win though, I really dig that.",2024-10-21 18:26:52

I've noticed a concerning trend with some Android manufacturers starting to restrict bootloader unlocking, which limits users' ability to install custom ROMs. Recently, I’ve seen Realme disable bootloader unlocking on certain devices, which seems like a step backward for Android’s ethos of being open and customizable.

This raises a broader question: Are we seeing the beginning of the end for true Android freedom? As enthusiasts, we've long appreciated Android's flexibility in letting users take control of their devices—whether it’s through custom ROMs like PixelOS  LineageOS, rooting, or simply tweaking the OS.

What are your thoughts on this trend? Should the Android community be more vocal about manufacturers locking down devices? Is this something we should be concerned about for the future of Android?

I’d love to hear what others think!",2024-10-20 12:15:35

The game is fully functional but still in beta, so I thought I’d reach out here on Reddit, where I know there are many active and passionate gamers who can provide valuable insights. 🎮

Here’s a bit about it:

* **Pandora Defense** is a thrilling game that combines classic Tower Defense strategy with RPG elements.
* 🌌 *Your mission*: Protect local colonies from waves of competitors by placing towers and deploying your space fleet strategically.
* 🏰 Each tower has unique abilities and can be upgraded to enhance its power.
* 🚀 Players can also recruit and level up spaceships, each with special skills.

If you enjoy games that blend strategy and RPG, this is definitely for you! The graphics even remind me a bit of *StarCraft* , which gives it a nostalgic feel. Your feedback will be invaluable in improving the game before its release. 😊 I’d be happy to pass along any suggestions directly to the developers.

Android,1g3t64d,My Travel Alarm app just got released!,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1g3t64d/my_travel_alarm_app_just_got_released/,29,"I started developing this app for myself back in 2014 when I was commuting to work regularly.  I always struggled with the inconsistent freeway traffic.  The app is **an alarm clock** that takes into account **up to date traffic data**.  You provide your **destination** and the **arrival time** and it does the rest to **get you there on time**.  I ultimately put it on pause, but then decided last year to pick this back up and finally finish it.  My wife came up with the name, [""Early Bird: The Smart Travel Alarm""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.earlybird.travelalarm&pcampaignid=web_share)   
[Small ad I also made to go along with it.](https://youtu.be/oq1jFN_8IKA?si=lJcAI8fDR0PsGKIp)

A few notable features:

* **Sibling Wear OS remote app** for quick preview of your active alarms
* Active **background location tracking** to update the alarms based on your current location.
* Customizable **dynamic distance buffer** to account for random occurrences on the way.
* Supports transportation via **biking, walking and driving.**
* **Copy and paste-able alarms** to share with friends.
* **Favorite/history location** storage as well as an **expired alarm storage** for quick re-creation of past alarms.
* **20 supported languages!**
* **Record your own alarm sounds** to make them custom and fun.  Up to 10 seconds in length.
* **Door-to-Road buffer** allowing you to give yourself specific time on getting into your car and on the road.
* Three notices per alarm.
   * **Prep alarm (snoozable)** - great for a wake up call allowing you to set a nice buffer before your scheduled leave.
   * **Five minute heads up** - A small chime to let you know you have five more minutes before leaving.
   * **Leave Alarm** - The actual notice that tells you it's time to go.
* Supports up to **10 waypoints that can act as rest stops**, so you can schedule an errand prior to your ultimate destination.  Great for accounting for custom routes and small pitstops along the way.
* **Repeating and single occurrence alarms** so you can schedule unique alarms for things like appointments as well as setup your regular weekly commute.
* Quick and easy single tap for **sending your alarm travel goals to your installed google maps app** for navigation.  Excellent when using waypoints.
* Bunch of fun ways to customize your alarms through **loads of icons and color options.**
* **Night mode** to ease on eye strain.
* **Military and Regular time format** support
* Plenty more features to come!  I would love to turn this into my day job and grow from here.",2024-10-14 22:52:46

Almost 4 years ago when I was 15 years old, I released a Magisk module called MagiskGApps, a Magisk module to flash GApps via Magisk, instead of via recovery.

I firstly made these files manually, and later, made a python script that converted a NikGApps file into a MagiskGApps file, but this was time consuming, and being in high school at the same time, I did not have time to create and upload all these files, meaning there was practically one update per android version.

About a year and a half ago, I created a JavaScript alternative to the Python script I made, meaning it could be easily ran on GitHub pages via a HTML form. I released this page to minimal success, but there where issues.

I then started university, and then the issues from before were not resolved. Recently, I have had some free time, and have fixed most issues with MagiskGApps Maker, and today, I think it is ready to be released to more people!

**Actual Info:**

The site converts a regular GApps package into a Magisk flushable zip file.

This can be useful for people on custom roms, who want to upgrade their current GApps variant, temporarily install google services or have google services toggleable via Magisk Manager. Can also be useful for people wanting google apps, but not wanting to run through the google setup.

The current supported GApps types are NikGApps and MindTheGApps.

All the files are open source, and do not require a server backend for file processing. This is more secure for you, and free for me, but does mean that the processing is happening on your browser and network. From my testing, it can cause chrome and other browsers to use extra recourses so please don’t leave the tab otherwise it may try to kill it!

**Current issues:**

I have not been able to test every single GApps variant, from every update of NikGApps. Due to the frequency of updates of NikGApps, it does make it impossible to know if it works for every variant and version, so please, if you do find an issue, report it on the GitHub Issues tab, with your exact GApps version, and what issue you ran into!

There is a bug in the code where you select one GApps version, and then the other, it will cause both scripts to run and cause a time out error. If you accidentally choose the wrong GApps version, you may have to refresh the page.

I would like as much feedback as possible and will try to answer any questions you have!

-----

I just checked my Xiaomi 14T Pro and noticed that I have [Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZF6Q0JXYAAVo3M?format=jpg&name=large) but not Remote Lock. Some Pixel users in the US tell me they have [Remote Lock](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZF6S_IXQAAKOA4?format=jpg&name=large) but not the other two.

* **Theft Detection Lock** uses a ML model to detect when someone snatches your phone from your hand and tries to run away with it on foot, by bike, or by car. If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data.  

* **Offline Device Lock** automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time.  

* **Remote Lock** lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.

All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil. Google told me the final versions of these features would more widely roll out this year, and it seems the features have begun expanding.

> **UPDATE:** The Galaxy M51 and A90 seem to have been affected as well. 

> **The update has been replaced with a new one**, so no *further* phones should be affected. I would still keep auto updates disabled.

> **IMPORTANT: Samsung Service Centers [reportedly can fix the phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/s/5J1Z32OIR4) without any data loss!**


## How is this happening?
It appears the cause is a **SmartThings Framework app update**, from the Galaxy Store, which initiates the bootloop while installing. 

Coincidentally, SmartThings Framework had been last updated on July 24th... until [today, October 2nd, at 3:41 AM GMT-0300](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/smartthings-framework/smartthings-framework-2-2-02-11-release/), with the earliest reports on Reddit appearing less than two hours after that.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1fueq0i/comment/lpz5szj) mentioned that people are approaching smartphone shops with the same problem. Other comments have confirmed the issue is present in Korea, the United States, Singapore, Australia, Belgium, France, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Germany. It's seemingly global.

>Devices confirmed to be affected.

* S10 Lite
* S10e
* S10
* S10+
* S10 5G
* Note10
* Note10+
* Note10+ 5G

No word on the Note10 Lite, but it is presumably affected as well.

## What should you do? 

If your phone is listed here, follow these steps to disable auto updates. [Video tutorial.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilerepair/s/mdmmAT0Q3u)

* Open the Settings app.
* Scroll down to ""Apps"".
* Look for and press *Galaxy Store*.
* Open ""Galaxy Store settings"".
* Set **""Auto update apps""** to **Never**. 

Additionally, **make sure all your data is backed up**.

**If your phone is EOL, I would do this as well. We don't know the full extent of the situation just yet.*

If you already suffered from this problem, you can visit a Samsung Service Center to get your phone repaired without losing your data! It's supposedly free of charge as well. [Here's more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/s/iBAs1iLkdV)

If you just want your phone back but DONT care about the data, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/s/QLd6Gh6xls) provides instructions on how to factory reset the phone, which will **wipe all data**.

However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.

On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.

Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and *then* pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).

My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating.",2024-10-03 22:59:40
