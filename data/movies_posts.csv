Instead of Jason Voorhees murdering sexy coeds at a camp by a lake, or Freddy Kruger murdering high schoolers in their dreams, it’s a goth dude murdering rapists and drug dealers in a city. 

Show us a dude, show him get killed by some assholes, and show him magically resurrected and out for revenge. The original Crow knocked all of that out in 10 minutes, so we could get to the good part. 

And don’t give the assholes magical powers and complex backstories. We’re not here for a fair fight. We’re here for inventive kills, fun choreography, and catharsis. We see some asshole being a bully, then we see the crow bully them back. We see some asshole pushing heroin, crow stabs him to death with 100 needles.  Simple.

movies,1gm2rpl,Film Flops Like ‘Borderlands’ & ‘The Crow’ Lead Lionsgate to Steep Quarterly Losses (-$163M),"Lionsgate didn't make John Wick. They bought it. It was a completely independent film, made by two of the top stuntmen in the industry, and their goal was to sell it at a festival for a theatrical release. Except that didn't happen, no one bought it, and they got more and more backed into a corner until finally they sold it to Lionsgate for a steal just to hopefully break even. Lionsgate bought it, and put it out 6 weeks later, which is borderline unheard of for a wide release movie. Insanely fast turnaround, which meant almost no marketing, press tour, anything. If it was any other movie it would have been buried. 

However the movie is fucking *great*, and it came out at just the right time, got a little lucky, and against all odds was a big hit. 

But don't give them credit for John Wick. They weren't even the hands-off Executive Producer money behind it or something, they had literally nothing to do with its creation. Borderlands and The Crow they were intimately involved with creating, and look how that turned out. 

You'd think that John Wick might make them realize ""we should just give talented filmmakers money to make creative genre movies that they really want to make."" But they're always chasing a repeat of Hunger Games for the stock price. The lesson from John Wick is so clear, just let great filmmakers make great movies and the money will follow.

>  People once believed that when someone dies,

>  But sometimes, something so bad happens that

And they fucked it on two accounts: it doesn't even seem like it's a crow that sends him back, and he's not even terribly sad with a soul that can't rest - he's just really fucking confused for a solid 15 minutes/the rest of the film.

And come on, the Crow films are an excuse for grungy, good music (to the point the first film can feel like a long series of music videos), and a dark aesthetic, and then they put the characters in pink sweats for 30 minutes of pretext, with two music tracks during the entire film.",20
movies,1gm2rpl,Film Flops Like ‘Borderlands’ & ‘The Crow’ Lead Lionsgate to Steep Quarterly Losses (-$163M),"Worth noting that, while you came to the right answer, it's actually for a different reason.

The source material was about the writer's fiance getting randomly hit and killed by a drunk driver out of nowhere.

So the whole point of the story is that:

a) The death is completely random (where in the remake it's targeted)

b) The murder is not by someone superpowered or anything like that, it's just people (where the remake makes it someone superpowered)

c) It might feel good to get revenge, but it doesn't matter how angry you get and what kind of revenge you get, you're not bringing her back (where the remake completely fails that)

All that results in the right answer being: no crazy backstory for the people, over-the-top revenge, a hero who is moody and dealing with loss, and an ending that, regardless of all that revenge, isn't happy for the couple.  Just for a different reason :)",20

It shouldn't be good.  The star died before filming could complete leading to a patchwork of occluded views and crafty editing, but it just *works*.  It's moody, it doesn't show too much but it gives you what you're craving.  I think maybe they were forced to consider it lost at one point and it freed them to do inventive things with it and some accidental magic happened somewhere.

But producers and directors can't accept that; everyone wants to prove that they understand the lightning in the bottle by reproducing it.  And time after time, they fuck it up.

I have pretty much stopped watching most of this kind of Hollywood stuff because almost none of it is a original. Hollywood has very famously sucked when it comes to originality, and I say this as a film history major... (There are certainly many exceptions but those are not 'big-budget/high-profit' type films, they only draw small audiences.) Stuff like The Lighthouse or The VVitch, Yorgos' films, Dune and just about anything Denis Villeneuve, Alejandro Innaritu and many, many more.

Foreign-language films; stuff coming out of France, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Denmark, and so many other countries are still making fantastic, original movies. Unfortunately Americans have some strange aversion to subtitles and those original movies are often character dramas that typically don't go well with American audiences to begin with. Sometimes they get re-made shot-for-shot into English language versions (The Ring for one example, and the recent ""Speak No Evil"" as another.) which ultimately end up catering to American audiences, watering the story down and very rarely actually end up as good films, but they almost make a good profit.

I believe the opening scenes were the most impacted, hence why the murder of Shelly and Eric feels a little disjointed and might actually be a bit hard to figure out what exactly happened if you're watching for the first time, but the rest of the movie is probably mostly as-intended.

I'm just going to be pretentious here and say you clearly have not seen or studied the foreign films, mostly European, but also Russian, Turkish, Iranian, Japanese, South Korean, and many more countries people don't realize have exceptional film industries. They absolutely DO get US releases, but they are always minimal and often don't make it to streaming services, you are stuck buying the physical copy or sailing the high seas.

This is just my opinion from having watched 7,890 films over the course of a decade, about 3500 not produced in the U.S. I am also talking about *film history*. Films that changed the way we make films today. A pretty even split between Hollywood any other 'foreign film'. 

Your comment about foreign audiences liking loud, stupid trash is hilarious when the vast majority of what passes for good in Hollywood is exactly that.

Clearly we have massively difficult tastes in movies. I enjoyed the first Transformers, the first Fast & Furious, a COUPLE MCU/DC movies, and that's about it when it comes to the type of you movies you reference.

***Expand your horizons.*** (But again, not everyone likes the same thing. Horror does very little for me. I enjoy characaters drama, existential films, etc. Not one to typically go for action except in exceptional cases like a movie like Heat by Michael Mann.)

...that he ""fell into film"" to make himself look like some sort of savant. That's not true. Dude was such a gifted photographed at age twelve that they had a dark-room in the house just for his photos. He was always contemplating art shcool after high-school.

...that he had a major in anthropology, effectivelly to explain why he has a kind of special insight into humanity that other filmmakers don't. He didn't: he has an associate and a major, both in arts. During his associate, in a local community college, he took some sociology classes and got a B for his pains.

...that in film school he was mainly interested in making ""non-narrative tone poems."" Nope: out of eight shorts he ever directed, only two are at all like this: Herbie and 6-18-67. His other shorts are either documentaries or narratives.

...that he planned all six (or nine, or twelve, depending on the version) Star Wars films. Usually the story goes that he wrote a script that grew to 250-pages so he split it into three or into six. I don't think I need to explain how that's clearly false, because besides the paper-trail, the experience of watching the films bears this lie out.

...within that, he claims that Jabba was always envisioned as an alien creature. Nope: the early drafts, concept art, costume design and casting all make clear that Jabba was a human gangster throughout the shooting of the original film. The idea of him as an alien came later, and the idea of him as a giant slug came later still. This is especially interesting because in order to reinforce this point, Lucas doctored a copy of the script in 1979.

There are other such examples: he says he had the idea of Star Wars much earlier than documented history would suggest he did. He sometimes exaggerates the significance of the car crash he had when he was younger. He gives himself more credit for ""helping"" Irvin Kershner out than he really deserves, etc...

But as often happens when wealth and power pass beyond the admirable and attain the awesome, then appear those evil ones who have greed to match. So it was with the Republic at its height. Like the greatest of trees, able to withstand any external attack, the Republic was rotted from within though the danger was not visible from outside.
Aided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic. He promised to unite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic.”

movies,1gma03e,"What are your biggest “Nah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it” statements from actors and filmmakers?","Well that is BS.

That said, I don't even think he planned out the PT either. In Attack of the Clones, they spend all the movie hyping up Count Dooku as the guy stirring up trouble and scheming to start a galactic war. They're unable to catch him, starting a galactic war. We are introduced to him like more than halfway through and we only just get to know him as the movie ends. This is an important character, clearly, and the movie ends before he really does all that much. Then in the next movie, he's killed in the first 15 minutes. Never mentioned again and his death seems to have no impact on the plot.

The Deathly Hallows themselves always stood out to me as feeling a bit of a clear retcon, but so much stuff is set up many books in advance: Sirius Black is mentioned in #1, the horcruxes, and Harry's relationship to them, are basically established in #2, Dumbledore has his 'gleam of triumph' at the end of #4, Snape's relationship with Lily informs his behaviour across the whole series, there's the locket they can't open in #5, etc. etc.

movies,1gma03e,"What are your biggest “Nah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it” statements from actors and filmmakers?","The closest thing to an original vision Lucas had for Star Wars is that it's always been something he's tinkered with. The original treatment from 1972 was meant to be an ongoing, open-ended serial like Flash Gordon or James Bond called *Journal of the Whills* \[the Force\] and the first installment was mostly just exposition. The first thing called *Star Wars* in 1973 had evolved those elements into a Kurosawa/WWII dogfight film mashup. By 1975 he had returned to the serial idea again, but through the release of the first movie it was referred to as either ""Episode 1"" or a standalone film (Lucas only decided to have Obi-Wan die after shooting had started). It only became ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" after release, while George was working on ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and he came upon the idea that Darth Vader would be Luke Skywalker's father, and there would be a trilogy about Luke and a trilogy about Anakin, and then maybe another trilogy about the next generation. Then came more substantial changes with the laserdisc, remastered, and special editions. Each time George would justify the changes by saying, ""Okay, but THIS is what I intended Star Wars to be all along.""

movies,1gma03e,"What are your biggest “Nah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it” statements from actors and filmmakers?",">  Like why not just train astronauts to drill?

ok i have a genuine question here: In Armageddon, the oil drillers are not operating any of the aircraft. There are trained NASA pilots who will fly the craft. The drillers are merely passengers on the ship.

Now, once they get to being in outer space, yes they have to know how the suits operate. But then what? Its not like the astronauts would have more experience being out in space on an asteroid, no one had ever done that before. The astronauts just need to use the drill machine on the asteroid, which was based on their own design they were familiar with.

So, the things the astronauts basically need to do:

make the trip to the asteroid, get out on the asteroid, and drill on the asteroid.

Only a few need to know how to fly the ship, none of them will have experience being on an asteroid, and only the drillers know how to use the drill. 

In this situation, it seems like as long as the asteroids are physically fit and can learn how to operate their suits, then what do you need to ""train"" them on. The things they trained on(when we see the simulations) are all drilling based, and we see THEM struggle with the simulations. So if the trained drillers are struggling to do this in the time frame, do we really think they could take people who know nothing about drilling at all and train them up to handle the situation in the same amount of time? So since neither group has any experience in the environment, you're either training astronauts with no drilling experience everything they need to know about how to drill and use the unfamiliar equipment, or you teach people who know how to drill and use that equipment how to...wear their space suit and ride in the space ship.

Hell, we're getting close to commercial space travel where we'll put rich old white dudes on space ships piloted by experienced astronauts and those people will be able to go into space. 

And we're even proven correct on the asteroid, as they had to go off instinct and ignore the machines warnings to push through and complete the mission.",22

They're saying they've picked up enough jargon and process and reflex-responses that they could maybe do something right-ish if ever in the truly impossible situation of having to do it in the real world with all the location, preparation, and support staff that the real qualified person would have. 

This is common for flight nerds, for space nerds, for mall cops and even spy novel or murder mystery enthusiasts. It's really common for anything that anyone picks up as an amateur.

movies,1gma03e,"What are your biggest “Nah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it” statements from actors and filmmakers?","You've got that the wrong way round. NASA considers their astronauts to be generalists who can be trained for any task. NASA doesn't send up specialists such as 'someone with 30 years experience of mechatronics'. It would be very inefficient as that individual would need to be trained on all the other systems on the shuttle or space station. The closest they've done has been sending up 'Payload Specialists' during a period in the shuttle era, though it was discovered it wasn't practical. Existing astronauts could do the tasks themselves. 


Sometimes they do send up people for PR reasons, such as John Glenn or the teacher who died on Challenger, Christa McAuliffe. The folks who go up to do actual work however are generalist astronauts. Ben Affleck was completely correct. It would have been far easier to train existing astronauts how to operate the drill. 


Astronauts tend to come from fields like test pilots, engineers, PhD scientists, medical doctors and surgeons. Smart, driven, high functioning individuals like that can be quickly and efficiently be trained in new skills. Before the Skylab program for example, NASA sent two of their test pilot astronauts to the US Air Force dental school and they apparently did well enough to pass as real dentists. They sent a PhD geologist to the moon on Apollo 17 but he had been an astronaut for several years beforehand and been trained to fly T-38 jet fighters.

In June 1986, a 15-year-old Wahlberg and three friends chased after three black children while yelling ""Kill the n\*\*\*\*\*, kill the n\*\*\*\*\*"" and throwing rocks at them. The next day, Wahlberg and the others followed a group of mostly black fourth-graders (including one of the victims from the previous day) taking a field trip on a beach, yelled racial epithets, threw rocks at them, and ""summoned other white males who joined"" in the harassment.

In April 1988, Wahlberg, then 16, assaulted a middle-aged Vietnamese-American man on the street, calling him a ""Vietnam fucking shit"" and knocking him unconscious with a large wooden stick. Later the same day, he attacked Johnny Trinh, another Vietnamese-American, punching him in the eye. When Wahlberg was arrested and returned to the scene of the first assault, he told police officers: ""I'll tell you now that's the mother-fucker whose head I split open."" Later, Wahlberg would explain that he was on PCP at the time. Investigators also noted that Wahlberg ""made numerous unsolicited racial statements...""

This is a side rant but I remember for years being annoyed anytime they brought hulking/humanoid popular comic book characters onto the big screen and it was like they were always intentionally trying to make them look as shitty as possible. It all started with Spiderman 3, Venom was small and not fully venom-like. TASM 1, Lizard looked like shit, they couldn't just commit to making him the big comic book lizard, they had to make him look like some half human/gecko clown. Killer Croc in Suicide Squad too. Then you get Rhino (for two seconds) in TASM 2, was just some fool in a robot suit. X-Men apocalypse, I was so excited thought we were gonna see the Apocalypse from the comic books but it was just 4 foot 11 Oscar Isaac in some purple face paint. Colossus in the original X-Men was just a slightly larger guy with metal skin. I think it took Avengers Infinity war before they finally had a comic accurate big guy with Thanos. Was amazed they didn't just paint Josh Brolin purple and call it a day, but they seem to be changing now for the better. I was just so sick of the directors always having to have their own interpretation on what these iconic looking characters should look like, too afraid to commit to the silly, but can't ground it enough, so you just have the worst of both sides.

At the age of 16, Wahlberg attacked two men in his hometown of Dorchester, Massachusetts.

The attacks were racially motivated, with Wahlberg using racial slurs against the victims, who were Vietnamese.

Wahlberg served 45 days of a three-month sentence for assault and other charges. He has since apologized for his actions and expressed remorse. In 2014, he applied for a pardon, but later withdrew the request.

Colossus in X2 was blessed with 5 seconds of screen time and turned them into a scene that fits the character perfectly, so I don't really care about his height, tall, broad dude fits the bill.

Similarly, Apocalypse's presence matters more than his size (that he can alter as he wishes anyway) and, while having humanoids of vastly different (and impossible by real world standards) sizes works in comics, it can get wonky on screen, so I'm fine with Oscar Isaac's version.

In other cases, it simply doesn't work.  Vinnie Jones' juggernaut totally failed to capture the threat level of the character and all he reminds me off is a cheap He-Man Ram-Man knockoff, which is clearly not ok.

> Luke: So, what do you think of her, Han?

> Han: I’m trying not to, kid.

>Luke: Good. *(smiles)*

>Han: *(notices smile)* Still, she’s got a lot of spirit. I don’t know, what do you think? You think a princess and a guy like me–

>Luke: *(jealously)* No.

There’s also a deleted scene in Empire Strikes Back where Luke all but confesses his love for Leia and does [straight up try to kiss her romantically](https://youtu.be/w7IDByqnP1A?si=hyNijgxoQUcK4qA9) with no Han around to make jealous. This scene continues into the kiss scene that does exist in the film.

Also also, it’s a known fact that Lucas originally wanted to do anywhere from nine to twelve total movies (the number fluctuated frequently) and that at some point he wanted to introduce a long-lost sibling of Luke as a new character, which is what Yoda’s “there is another” line was setting up. However, George Lucas decided he wanted to retire from filmmaking for a while, so he decided to just wrap it up in the next movie. But he’d already set up the sibling thing, so they just made Leia his sister in order to tie up the loose thread.

something?

can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s
some evidence, some artifact of
higher dimensions that we can’t
consciously perceive. I’m drawn
across the universe to someone I
haven’t seen for a decade, who I
know is probably dead. Love is the
one thing we’re capable of
perceiving that transcends

Brand talks about 'Love' as a force because that is her post hoc rationalisation for why she wants to choose the planet that has her boyfriend on it. He *is* on the right planet, but that's not because she loves him, there is no causative link there.

The film does not treat love as a physical force or a universal constant, regardless of how Brand chooses to try and rationalise what is ultimately a selfish (but incidentally correct) decision. What the film is saying - which isn't a terribly profound observation - is that love can be a powerful motivation for human action, and can prompt people to make leaps of faith, in the absence of conclusive data, that an entirely rational approach might discount.

It isn't love that gives Cooper the means to communicate the vital data to Murph, it's just love that makes her decide to listen.",90

I've given it multiple chances, hoping something might click, but aside from that powerful moment when Coop sees decades’ worth of his kids’ messages, none of the other emotional beats really hit. It feels like Nolan was trying to make a Spielberg-esque film but missed the mark on capturing that genuine heart and sense of wonder that Spielberg’s movies have.

Instead, the film often comes across as overwrought and heavy-handed. I also really disliked how Casey Affleck’s character was handled—it felt shallow and one-dimensional. And then there’s Anne Hathaway’s “love monologue,” which, to me, borders on cringeworthy—not because of the message, but because of how it’s written and delivered. It just doesn’t land the way it was likely intended to, atleast for me.

Overall, it just didn’t work for me. It’s visually stunning and ambitious, but emotionally, it fell flat.",19

The concept was great, amazing soundtrack, very good visual effects and cinematography, but tbh I felt like it suffered from being overly melodramatic at times, as well as from Nolan's inability to ever be subtle about anything.

Its like Nolan wants *so badly* to be Stanley Kubrick, but he's also terrified of any audience member not understanding what he's trying to say, so he has to have characters come on screen and literally explain shit to the viewer, sometimes multiple times, rather than making you have to think about anything, ever... and that's why he'll never be Stanley Kubrick.",7

Starting from the overt message that battling climate change is pointless and we should put all effort into evacuating to other planets (a horrific and stupid message), we have absurd notions like the main character out of nowhere just getting handed the humanity-saving mission to go out into space, cringe-worthy sci Fi tropes like the folded piece of paper/pencil analogy, lots of basic science that doesn't work (relevant as the scientific accuracy of the film was a big part of the marketing) such as the giant waves over the solid surface of that watery planet and a total cop out ending that doesn't make any sense. 

Serious suspension of disbelief allows enjoyment of some really good set piece moments of action and tension but almost every time that tension is punctured by a giant walking talking cigarette packet which sprouts arms and legs to save the day.",1

the crew on this mission are the least emotionally disciplined people ever, it's like they pulled 6 people off the street and blasted them in a can to space. they're having freakouts left and right. there are plot holes with the timing and stuff like how the characters never need to eat, the whole tesseract section was visiby impressive still but dumb.

When you first watch it, you are so consumed by the grand scale and emotional weight of certain parts of it that you ignore the flaws. The videos from the kids after the time skip is genuinely one of the most emotionally impactful scenes in recent cinema history. The scene with the huge waves is fucking incredible to witness. Nolans directing is, of course, operating on a whole other level throughout these scenes. 

These sequences can make you forget that the actual plot and writing is... kinda bad. Nonsensical at best, cringy and clunky at worst. The relationship with the family, the whole ""love overcomes physics"", the comically rushed ending... Remove a handful of outstanding scenes and the movie collapses.

I prefer scifi and I'd rather watch Interstellar, but critically Dunkirk is a much greater achievement in film making.  It's much less demanding to make Interstellar.   No hate, just that I think perspective on what film is his best achievement is good to hold onto.  Dark Knight even, is harder to make - action sequences are much more difficult, and many more sets/locations to shoot on.  Do not go softly into the night...


Not debating anything here, I comment and move on to feel I'm attached to things... Emotionally ...the boat captain who might well want to tell the solider that the kid died because of him, and doesn't at the end of Dunkirk.  Hit emotionally hard too...Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy... fantastic performances.   Matthew McConaughey was fantastic in Interstellar...but I felt a little let down by the other performances.  That scene fantastic though.


Oppenheimer for all that it was felt like it didn't have these things - perhaps a nod to the fact that you can't do that in a biopic so easily without offending history.

The visuals, score, acting, story.. the feeling of what's at stake, the weight of all that the characters take onto themselves. The sense of lonliness you feel when they're in space. The sense of desperation of life on Earth and what its become..

But it is his only film, I’d argue, that actually has an emotional core. Inception is cool but blank. Oppenheimer is pure Oscar bait biography. The Dark Knight trilogy comes a little closer, but I have never cared about a single character in a Nolan film outside of Interstellar.

He doesn’t go for glory, he goes to come back. His sole purpose is to come back.

I find the people who don't like it are usually the ones expecting to ""solve the plot"" or a third of the runtime dedicated to an in-depth explanation of how blight and feelings work. 

On the flip side of that, I do think it's one of Nolan's best films if you can vibe with it. IMO It really nails that feeling of trying to do something bigger than yourself and the sacrifices that can come with it.  Sure it can be a bit blunt at times but the overall package hits in a way that I don't think many other movies do.",1

My daughter and I always throw this movie out in conversation to see who is blinded by the shiny objects and who understands what a lazy, ridiculous script this is, filled with laughingly bad exposition (my favorite is the conversation McConaughey and Damon have WHILE they are chasing and fighting, laboriously explaining the plot while they roll down a cliff. So bad), contrived plot points (the years - long mission with hundreds of scientists and engineers to save humanity but which has no pilot until Matthew McConaughey literally shows up by accident, one day before launch and just happens to intimately know the mission designer, then leaves with zero prep or training.  Is this good writing?). Oh and how about the crack best-of-the-best crew that has no command structure, no plans on what order to do anything and argue about it while already on the mission, make decisions about a scientific mission based on mumbo jumbo about love with dialogue that sounds like it came from a 1940's b-movie, sends the crew down to the gravity planet INSTEAD OF THE FUCKING ROBOT, then sends humans out to the surface INSTEAD OF THE FUCKING ROBOT, needs a 3-stage saturn rocket to lift off from earth but then after that has a ship that can just fly up and down from planets no problem, including one at the edge of a black hole, and on and on. And it has maybe the only bad, laughably over the top performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon.  This is a movie that is almost impossible not to make fun of in real time.  Oh, it is beautiful looking, I'll give it that. And the earth scenes about climate change are great.  But logic and screenwriting?  Nolan needed someone to tell him, ""no.""",1

But when you get why they're made but just can't get them past it that can be hard, and imagining leaving--possibly forever--on those terms is absolutely gut wrenching.

Entering this new uncharted territories, beyond anything in their programming or their ability to learn/adapt. Highlighting what was said earlier in the movie, when asking why couldn't they just send robots in there. And then much later in the conversation with Dr Mann where he elaborate further on this point. Emphasizing the importance of why a human needs to be on this mission.

There are no simulation, AI training models, or anything really, that would have given even an entire platoon of these robots, on this mission, at that moment, the human intuition, last ditch effort. To try docking an exploded orbital station, stuck in an uncontrollable spin, in the process of crashing towards a planet. The robots assessment would have probably just been to analyze, comprehend how dire the situation is, calculate paths to recovery/success/failure. Then just wait for the inevitable, in poetic total calmness, because of their lack of human emotions.

That human, in that moment, was the only one capable of seeing the light. Refusing to give up, pushing just a little further for the ones he loves. ""Refusing to go gentle into that good night, raging, raging against the dying of the light""",5

movies,1glmpzd,"'Interstellar': 10 years to the day it was released – it stands as Christopher Nolan's best, most emotionally affecting work.","It's also riddled with inaccuracies that prevent me from really enjoying the movie as much as I should.

Talking about specifically the docking scene, the assumption that the explosion sent the Endurance into a perfect radial spin without any normal component to it at all is a stretch, and even if it didn't, the dzhanibekov effect should be sending it into a tumble if the center of mass (post explosion) was even slightly misaligned with the center of rotation.

Additionally, once the lander has docked with the rotating Endurance, and has slowed the rotation, the engines on the lander fire to push the ship back into a stable orbit, despite the lander being docked to the underside of the Endurance, which would just send everything spinning again, instead of getting any significant momentum back. 

My last nitpick is that Cooper says 'pushing out of orbit' when trying to get back INTO orbit. Like bro, you're already out of orbit, that line makes no sense.

All that being said, the soundtrack and visuals go hard, and I love the sound design (especially keeping no audio in space), but I just have too many nitpicks with the movie to enjoy it as much as most people seem to.",-7

While I disagree, I understand exactly what you mean. The latter 3 which you mentioned have an epic nature to it, sort of like a Greek adventure or cautionary tale. An unwanting hero, or an unwavering man, pushes beyond his capabilities to become something he either thought he never could be or wondered if he would. The storytelling is coated in a style of directing reminiscent of when the writing had to pull all the weight the technology does, nowadays and the arcs were quite well defined.

 The reason why I kept liking Nolan now, is because now it seems like he's allowing himself to have fun with his movies. They are daring and groundbreaking (in concept, like Tenet) and for exactly that reason, there's isn't a concensus regarding their validity as master pieces. But that's what I like about them: they are projects aiming outwardly from Hollywood's ""done and proven"" safe space, and exactly what cinema is supposed to be.

 My favorite film by him is Tenet. Probably for the same reason why a lot of people don't like it. I love that he pulled all the stops in the sound design, so much so that sometimes you struggle with the dialogs. I like the confusing storytelling, because it made me have to watch the film 6 times, before I got it. I like the underlying idea of radical determination under the covet of apparent chance.

 And I like that Nolan did something that Nolan usually does: put uncharacteristic actors, in uncharacteristic roles, and once again getting away with it.

One of the big reasons the film work so well in my opinion is because it takes its damn time setting up the relationship between Cooper and Murph.

So many films rush this build up, or don’t take care in making it 3 dimensional, so when the big emotional moment comes you’re not properly invested and it doesn’t connect. 

Never noticed how this is the only film that Nolan does this. 

In Tenet it’s the opposite, you’re force fed from early on “these 2 are in love now for some reason, got it?”

The sci-fi plot, while absolutely excellent, is merely a backdrop for the poignant family drama. The family drama is the heart and soul.

It feels like a clouded view of him searching his soul, feeling overwhelmed, feeling anxious, and taking in a whole new reality while “wondering if he’s gonna die” etc in a vortex of emotions and feelings. 

After seeing himself/becoming the ghost of himself, he probably was visually, audibly, and emotionally/mentally dazed, he sees various nuggets of new truth of his own existence. He learned some layers to his confused sense of self, his existence, and found a way to alter the unknown.

Although “Earth life” in the film was already a difficult life, he learned how much his example and love mattered just as much (or more) than his trek to the stars, and through time and space.

Part of me KNEW this movie was going to be incredible and would blow my socks off, even WAY before it was released. 

I shared the pre-release trailers to almost every single person I knew at the time, because I was so hyped.

Then I saw the film, and it surprised me in ways I simply couldn’t have imagined or anticipated.

I have recommended it to countless people who “never saw it or” “heard it was good, but never tried watching it.”

I have had a few dozen people come back in the days or weeks after sitting down to watch it, -literally report to me like it was a homework assignment- extensively talk or gush about how much they loved the film.

movies,1glmpzd,"'Interstellar': 10 years to the day it was released – it stands as Christopher Nolan's best, most emotionally affecting work.","> The future humanity, bookshelf nonsense was completely touchy-feely fantasy

No, it's just science-fiction, like you'd find in 2001, or The Martian, or Moon, or Ad Astra, or Arrival, or Twelve Monkeys, or The Abyss. It relies on concepts or technologies which we either know do not exist or can only speculate on - time travel, wormholes - to tell its story, that's all. I've never seen anyone call 2001's Monolith ""fantasy"" or ""nonsense"", even though it is simply an improbable and unknowable machine of much the same order as Interstellar's tesseract.

> I see no reason why love being a physical, measurable connection between the two people and events is untenable in the context of the film

It's not untenable at all, the film could well make the case that love is a universal physical force, like gravity - it wouldn't be any more unlikely than Amy Adams experiencing time in a loop because she learnt an alien language. But just because Brand advances that argument in a moment of pleading desperation because she doesn't want the man she loves to be abandoned and die alone on a barren rock, doesn't mean that the film - or Nolan - is advancing that viewpoint, and she certainly isn't presenting that argument as a rigorous hypothesis in her capacity as a scientist, as many viewers certainly seem to act like she is.

When Brand and Murph are confronted with life-changing decisions to be made where they just don't have enough data to form a definite conclusion, they make leaps of faith to choose whichever option brings them nearer to that connection with someone they love. Love isn't really a force, it's just the foundation of the belief they need to cling to when science can't get them all the way there.",5
movies,1glmpzd,"'Interstellar': 10 years to the day it was released – it stands as Christopher Nolan's best, most emotionally affecting work.","I get why some people take that away from the movie, but as I've said elsewhere it's really gravity that links Cooper with Murph and the bookcase, and the film makes it pretty explicit that the evolved future humans are manipulating gravity to create the wormhole and guide humanity to finding a safe planet.

Love is the reason that Murph is looking for a message from Cooper, and love is the reason why Cooper wants to send that message, but the thing that puts them in contact and sends that message is gravity.",2
movies,1glmpzd,"'Interstellar': 10 years to the day it was released – it stands as Christopher Nolan's best, most emotionally affecting work.","> the movie ends up with the protagonist entering a black whole that connects to his daughter library and saying how their love is quantifiable

Love is how the future humans knew that Cooper's message to Murph would get through to her, but he doesn't send the message with love, he sends it with gravity, because the film has already set up multiple times that some unknown group are using gravity to lead Cooper towards the information he needs to save Earth.

> it gives validation to Brands out of character love comment

Really? She's travelled billions of miles away from Earth on a one-way trip in order to see the man she loves, and now she finds out that the two people making the trip with her don't want to go to that planet. She's so close to him and yet Cooper and Romilly want her to be separated from him forever because it's what the data suggests they should do. I don't think it's at all out of character that she gets upset and tries to change their mind. In some movies a character in this situation would try to hijack the mission at this point. All things considered I think she takes the fact that her boyfriend is going to die alone on an alien planet and there's not a damn thing she can do about it pretty well.

> there's no escaping lazy romanticism in this movie. The words ""love is quantifiable"" are said, and the word love and connection is used constantly at the end

I don't think it's lazy. Cooper loves his daughter, Brand loves her boyfriend, and that love drives a lot of their decisions. Is that lazy? I figure most fathers would probably do anything to save their daughters, and probably most people would do anything to save their partners. These characters are humans, not robots, it would be absolutely bizarre if the film was written so that emotions never influenced their decisions.

The movie is about human emotion. Cooper leaves on the mission because he wants to fly again, to go to space, but also because he wants to save his daughter from dying on an uninhabitable Earth. Brand leaves because she wants to see Edmunds again. Mann sabotages his own mission and almost ruins Cooper's as well because he's terrified of dying alone in space. Murph goes back to her bedroom to look for a message from Cooper because she loves him so much that she *needs* to believe he can find a way back to her. 

All of these characters make huge decisions based on emotion rather than logic; sometimes it leads to success, and sometimes it leads to disaster. Love is quantifiable in the sense that it has an observable, measurable effect on the way people behave, and that it influences them to act in certain ways that they otherwise wouldn't, but it's not an actual physical force like gravity.",2

I do not think I am misunderstanding the movie as you claimed, and think that the love Murph and Cooper experience is what makes the connection in the black hole possible - that as Brand claims it is a fundamental, observable force. Your perspective is valid - I believe mine is also considering the events inside the black hole fly in the face of what we know, are not clearly explained, and can subsequently be treated as open to interpretation. There is nothing in the film that suggests love is not actually a genuine force, rather than a motivation.

The biggest sin this movie commits to me though is how it talks the audience step by step through what they’re seeing on screen. He didn’t trust the audience to be able to understand visual storytelling so felt the need to explain it all away. It’s like if HAL and Dave went through the Stargate together and monologued over the sequence to bludgeon the audience over the head with the theme in 2001. Obviously Kubrick didn’t do that and 2001 is all the better for it 

But evidently even still there were so many people who didn’t understand what happened at the end of Interstellar

It has everything to do with machines. The god in the greek plays would often be lowered down via a crane to resolve the problems. ""God in the machine"" fixes the conflict. >!That's exactly what happens in the Prestige, except instead of God it's literal magic, added to the movie by a machine.!< It is a completely accurate usage of the term.

>!There was no reasonable explanation to Hugh Jackman's ""doppelganger"". The entire movie relied on an understanding that magic isn't real, and yet the explanation is that you can use a machine to create magic. That's literally deus ex machina, they gave up trying to make these tricks be logical, instead replaced it with a ridiculous explanation. I have watched it 3 times, each time I watch I hope that there's some kind of visual queue that suggests that the machine isn't actually real, but if that is the explanation, it's very poorly delivered.!<

It's actually the same problem as interstellar, where the guiding principle that fixes the center most paradox is ""love"". Again, Deus Ex Machina, but not as literal. >!Rather than try to explain (as they so painstakingly do with every minor scientific concept in the film) how Cooper's ""ghost"" somehow bypasses the Grandfather paradox, they just excuse it by saying ""love transcends time and space"" 🤮!<

And normally I'm not this picky when it comes to plots, it's a visual medium. But when you spend 140 minutes having characters explain every single detail to you trying to make the events seem logical, you can't just throw away the realism in the last act to tie up all of the loose ends. Why did I watch this nonstop exposition if you're still gonna close it up with some ridiculous sci Fi bullshit.

The crane wasn't literally part of the play. It's also not what happens in the Prestige.   
>There was no reasonable explanation to Hugh Jackman's ""doppelganger"". The entire movie relied on an understanding that magic isn't real, and yet the explanation is that you can use a machine to create magic. That's literally deus ex machina, they gave up trying to make these tricks be logical, instead replaced it with a ridiculous explanation

This is a complete misunderstanding of deus ex machina. Deus ex machina is not the implementation of a solution by means of magic. Deus ex machina is a sudden solution by means that are not natural *within the context of the story*.    
The Prestige more than contextualize the possibility of the machine being able to clone. You are literally told it does that halfway through the film. It is reinforced over & over. Learning that it actually does clone does not come out of no where. It's not even a sudden solution. It's just a twist.    
You, the audience, were conditioned early on to expect the machine to not actually clone. You expect there to be a solution of natural means. Its too simple of a solution. Like the twin theory. You know, like it's the point of the fucking film.

Thats Interstellar, not The Prestige.   
And you're still not understanding. The ex machina isn't the existence of a God acting within the story. Harry Potter isn't an entire series length Deus Ex Machina (although there are Deus Ex Machina's used).    
>The author couldn't resolve it naturally"" your words

'Naturally', as in naturally in the context of the story. Not naturally in how physics of the world work. Deus ex machinas can even be delivered by laws of nature natural things.    
>Saying ""Magic isn't real"" for the first 2 acts and then in the 3rd act saying ""oh wait actually magic is real we invented a machine.

In the context of the story, its not magic, but science (although that means little overall). But that's still not a Deus ex machina. Deus ex machina isn't magic. It's not the sudden existence of magic. It's a sudden source of resolution that wasn't established. The author was trapped, & took a cheating route to solve it. That is not what happens.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"It was intended for the movie but I don’t think Disney intended for the wide scale ramifications of its actions with Aladdin.

At the time it was a big deal Robin Williams was cast in it and Disney wanted to play into that for marketing. Williams’ contract specifically said only to use him for X% of advertising, and Disney marketing danced around that in various ways until eventually it just disregarded it and fully leaned in. This lead to a big split between Williams and Disney that lasted for years. 

But the ramifications of this decision (mostly because of Williams in Aladdin, but earlier in part because of Billy Joel in Oliver and Company) lead to a sweeping precedence for the entire AAA animated film industry. Now basically ANY major animated movie will not only go out of its way to cast as many celebrities as possible to be in the movie (often relegating huge portions of the budget to fulfill this) instead of actual seasoned voice actors, but also now more or less the meat of the marketing campaigns for nearly all these movies is to highlight how many stars are in it (often times this is the only thing the trailer is really trying to communicate).

“Hey you see this animated camel movie about Jesus’ birth or something, idk, you don’t care, well guess what it has Tyler Perry, and Oprah, and Keegan Michael Key, Mariah Carey, and Kelly Clarkson, Gabriel Iglesias, and Zachary Levi.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"I disagree about The Hobbit and NZ. First off, The Hobbit trilogy is definitely not as bad as some “fans” want it to be. It’s an adaptation, it was never going to be 100% loyal to the book, it needed to flesh out Tolkien’s short descriptions of life and lore in Middle Earth. So it was bound to be long - which is much better than if they had crammed the story in an incomprehensible single movie. (Yes, we all know PJ wanted to make only 2 movies, that wasn’t going to happen either, these things go in trilogies). What the movies aren’t, and are not SUPPOSED to be is clones of the original trilogy. Because the book was very much different. I’m a bit puzzled by your criticism that they relied too much on the original characters … given that those are the characters who move things along in the background for millennia, it’s a good bet to rely on them for the occasional epic conversation or combat, not to mention for sage quips.

As for NZ: changing the law is not something movie producers do. It’s up to the legislature, blame them. Thousands of tourists spend thousands of dollars every year to go to NZ to what is arguably a glorified Ren faire. We have those by the dozen every year in most if not in all European countries.

Warner Bros. wanted to move filming to someplace cheap like Romania, while Peter Jackson had the clout to keep it in NZ if he directed the project.

Anti-unionizing is not the same as destroying the industry. There's an ongoing debate in ecomonics as to the viability of unions to begin with, and its not one that's going to be settled on a cinema-related forum.

But mostly I object to the premise of this thread: this attempt to delegitimate movies and to moralize film criticism by painting productions - incidentally, they all happen to be productions that became something of a whipping boy for the internet - as some sort of moral transgressions.

Ultimately, the movie is a movie and people since 2012 going forward have, are and will watch it for what it is. It isn't one iota a better movie or a worse one - in terms of blocking, acting, plot development - for this malarky. What you and people like Lindsay are trying to do is to posit that its wrong to like this film on an ""ideological"" level.

Jackson basically hijacked the entirety of geek subcultures for white supremacists, which lead directly to movements like Gamergate, and the constant screeching you hear online whenever a new TV show or movie presents a non-white or woman actor.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"I couldn’t disagree more with your take on The Hobbit. The Hobbit trilogy is a better trilogy than the LotR trilogy, and it’s the one I keep coming back to time and time again for how truly outstanding it is. 

To be clear, the Lord of the Rings _books_ are infinitely better than the Hobbit book, but this is exactly why I prefer The Hobbit film trilogy to the LotR film trilogy.

The Hobbit movies took a very short, juvenile, and relatively unsophisticated work and fleshed it out into something visually stunning, highly engaging, and fully in the spirit and tone of the mythology of Middle Earth.

Contrarily (and necessarily), the LOTR films carried the burden of having to translate a 1000+ page masterpiece of poetry and storytelling into just a few hours of film. It was a mission all but guaranteed to fail. The effort was definitely admirable, but ultimately futile.

Martin Freeman, in my eyes, made a much more compelling and interesting Bilbo than Elijah Wood as Frodo. Elijah’s performance always pulls me right out any kind of immersion that might have been achieved. Same goes for Aragorn (he’s an elite warrior who’s spent his entire life wandering the countryside. Why is he so scrawny?), Legolas (“a red sun rises, blood has been spilled this night”—wtf kind of line is that? I laugh out loud because of how utterly absurd it is), Arwen (I can’t see Arwen, only Liv Tyler), and at the time of release it was tough having Agent Smith from The Matrix play Elrond, but that hang-up at least has faded with time. Also, why did they make King Theoden so damn weak and despicable? In the books he was valiant but facing impossible odds. In the movies he’s a coward. Too many liberties were taken with these characters.

On the other hand, The Hobbit is thoroughly absorbing. Smaug is positively delightful. I was astounded by how brilliantly he was brought to life by Benedict Cumberbatch. Everything was so carefully put together, with such attention to detail, that I was able to lose myself in the story and world of the movie without being encumbered by all the glaring omissions and shortcomings of LOTR. Radagast is actually acknowledged and shown to be a powerful Maia, not just some doofus with bird shit in his hair, which you’d be forgiven for thinking if you’d only seen the LOTR films. Hell, there was even a scene in The Hobbit where the dwarves sing, and it’s so dwarfish. It’s doleful and dark, with everyone humming harmonies in rich baritones and basses while one sings the lyrics mournfully by the light of a fire. It was brilliant.

Very few movies that expand on a book of more limited source material do so successfully, and The Hobbit Trilogy pulls it off splendidly.",-3

On the special features documentary about how they made *Knives Out*, Johnson revealed that it was getting harder for him to cast for movies because a lot of star power was just ""Waiting for the call"" that they're wanted for the MCU and some actors are actually refusing smaller roles just to prevent a conflict of interest that would keep them out of the MCU if it were ever offered. This is because the MCU offered big actors a rarity in their industry - a steady paycheck.

As a consequence, Johnson had to do a major form of stunt-casting to ensure that none of the available actors would just say, ""Sorry, but Disney just called"".

Daniel Craig was always on board from the earliest stages of the production. He was the main draw - in fact, Jamie Lee Curtis said that one of the reasons she and a few of her co-stars were drawn to the project was the chance to work with Craig. Everyone else in the main cast - they only joined about six weeks before filming was set to begin, and this was expressly because Johnson only wanted people who were indeed immediately available.",33

Just like flying an airplane where you need specific endorsements on your license to do certain things like fly at night or in inclement weather or fly multiple engines, or having a forklift safety class before your company allows you to operate one in their warehouse.  


There needs to be safety classes and certifications before anyone is allowed to handle firearms on a set so that everyone that handles said firearm is familiar with how it works, knows how to handle it safely, and most importantly knows how to easily identify whether or not it's loaded with live ammunition or blanks or if it's actually a prop gun. 


This safety certification is,  IMO,  far more important than any other situation where you handle firearms since the first rules are always ""safety first,  always treat the gun as if it's loaded, and never point it at anything you don't intend to kill"" and those last two go right out the window when you're filming a movie.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"Heyy, I've had dalmatians since I was very young so can speak anecdotally.

They're sweet dogs with tons of personality. They aren't aggressive about it but will be very stubborn - you can't tell them 'no'. They will get up on the sofa. They will lie on your bed. They will grumble when you dry their feet. They will start whining if you feed them late. If you have a cat tray, they *will* eat cat poop when you're not looking. They scrounge for human food and will very likely swipe it when you're not looking. They also hate being left alone, and can't hold their bladders too well, making them poor choices for working families. Training them can be difficult, and you have to set the ground rules early. 

All the ones I have had have been easy to toilet train, for what it's worth.

One thing people forget is that they are both black *and* white, so their hairs get on everything. Their hairs have a needle-like quality, which can be very difficult to remove from upholstery. Despite being short haired dogs, they malt a lot and require brushing a fair amount. That said, all the ones I have had love being brushed, there used to be a little queue forming of all the animals wanting to be brushed haha

There are a lot of health concerns. They are often bred to be a bit bigger than they should be, and their legs often get problems later in life. They have a high chance of being deaf. They may require special diets to avoid stone-forming issues. They can become expensive puppies!

All these things make dalmatians a breed with a ton of personality that really make an impact on families with stay-at-home parent(s) and children. They are lovely dogs that are unforgettable. But they need a specific kind of care, and for people that can't or won't offer that, they are not the ideal breed.",6

That's not to say they didn't have impacts as well, but I guess what I'm saying is there was clearly some societal shift already taking place which those movies embraced. 


You can also see a bit of that about a decade earlier with a lot of B-movie plotlines. I watched Roger Corman's 'The Masque of the Red Death' just the other day, for example, and the idea that the main bad guy worships Satan is a big plot point (which isn't there in the Poe story the movie was based on). That's only one example, but I know I've seen plenty of movies from that time period where Satan worship was a key plot point meant to shock audiences.

That means that the person who handed him the gun personally checked the gun. They didn't. And neither did the person before that. The gun was both taken off set and used for target practice and left unattended. All of these are violations of the established on set firearm rules.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"Idris Elba, an actual Englishman as Aragorn. If you insist on casting Americans, like Jackson did, Denzel Washington. 

Jackson was so desperate to show off New Zealand, how about Cliff Curtis as Eomer, Rena Owen as Eowyn, Temuera Morrison as Theoden. Maybe Nathaniel Lees as Denethor. 

Motherfucking Avery Brooks, long arm of Federation law, as Elrond. Tim Russ as Legolas. LeVar fucking Burton as anyone you choose to name (but probably Boromir).

Or, you want Legolas to jump around and do crazy stunts? Jackie Chan. Jet Lee. Donnie Yen. Get Michelle Yeoh as Arwen, Chow Yun-Fat as Elrond. 

Tony Cox as *literally any hobbit or dwarf.*

That's literally just a list of actors I can think of off the top of my head who were active in the late 90's. There are hundreds more. You could try using Google yourself for more.

The real question is - why did you need to ask? Jackson cast a Danish-American as Aragorn and two Americans as hobbits. An American as Arwen. 

The casting decisions weren't  rigorous. Mortensen didn't even bother to change his accent, they were taking literally anyone they could find for the role.

Tolkien didn't tell us the races of every character, and only implied those of a few. He described Sam as ""brown,"" and Legolas had black hair, so why didn't Jackson try to be faithful to the book there?

So what's even the point of your question? Literally any role could have gone to anyone, Jackson didn't even get the actors' heights right, he didn't give a shit. 

Name any character. Ok, that one. That's the answer to your question. So why even ask?

Can *you* name a reason why whites-only casting was better? Of course you can't, don't even try. There isn't one. Can you give *one reason* to justify a movie in the year of our Lord two thousand and fucking one having whites-only casting?

I went by the house in 2011 pre-fence and after the front door driveway was removed and than again in 2015 and remember the fence being only like knee high but it's much taller now (or I'm misremembering) and they added landscaping. I also walked by on Christmas Eve and there were a lot of people. I always figured the owners would leave for a few days and come back a few days later. There was a whole thing a few years ago where AirBnB worked with the owners to do some sort of deal where someone could stay the night there.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"People online absolutely do insist that the punching people and bombing the establishment ideas are things dumb guys come away from it idolizing. They also say that about the Tyler Durden part that you mentioned, which is tangled up in my point too. To think Durden is worth idolizing means they idolize the things he does, i.e. bombings and violence. 

I am rejecting the idea that this subset of people supposedly misinterpreting this movie is statistically significant whatsoever. I am also rejecting the idea that most people who are “seduced” by Durden’s coolness are actually endorsing his behavior in real life or coming away with the idea that Tyler’s destruction should be emulated. I think that, like Belfort, he’s a fun movie character whose coolness relies in large part on the fact that they ARE movie characters. Being “seduced” by these types of screen presences and characters does not mean huge portions of viewers are internalizing and endorsing their actions. It means they find them compelling in stories about men losing their minds trying desperately to find some feeling of personal power. 

Again, I think people like to imagine a dumb person out there misunderstanding a sort of complicated theme/movie. They take this idea and run with it: “this could be misinterpreted, thus there’s a whole generation of young men who think acting like Belfort and Durden is right because they saw a movie.”",5
movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"Just because video essays on craft and theme exist doesn’t mean my claim that this toxic audience trope is overstated is untrue. Overstated doesn’t mean it’s literally the only thing in existence that is discussed about the film. I should have known better than to exaggerate on Reddit by using the word “only” instead of “often” so that is my mistake. 

I’m talking about online Reddit comments and podcasts always focusing on that aspect. Obviously a video essay made about a specific theme or filmmaking techniques wouldn’t focus on the cultural/audience response because that’s not what they’re about. But in general discussions online, it is very common to hear this toxic audience trope come up ad nauseam to the point of dwarfing a lot of more substantive conversations.

Go search “fight club” on Apple Podcasts and listen to every podcast that comes up. I have. You’ll hear A LOT of conversation about it - in my opinion an *overstated* amount of conversation relative to the actual number of people being toxic in real life because of these movies. Go on Reddit and search “fight club” and read over the years just how much of the thread is devoted to the toxic audience trope. I have. You’ll hear A LOT of conversation about it - again in my opinion an *overstated* amount of conversation relative to the actual number of people being toxic in real life because of these movies. 

I didn’t say you said the film was bad. And no, you didn’t use the word unethical. You said an entire generation of men had taken on these character personas. Certainly you think those men becoming horrible psychopaths is unethical, and you said this film “created” them. So there’s the connective tissue - this film is always (read: often) smothered in discussion of the toxic audience it created. 

You also said the existence of this generation of inspired Belfort knock-offs was obvious. I simply contest that they exist in major numbers and I certainly don’t think it’s *obvious* that they exist in any meaningful way. I sincerely doubt that study parties idolizing Jordan Belfort were such a phenomenon, certainly not so big of a thing that a generation of young men were involved in them.

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"For sure. I think ultimately what I'm complaining about is that online discussions of these movies is so totally dominated by this discussion of what the worst/dumbest people alive *might* take away from a movie.

I just think a film like Fight Club has so much to chew on (and WoWS), that it's a shame almost none of it really gets discussed because it's always dwarfed by conversations about morons/bad-faith interpretations. Even listening to podcasts on it, hosts will devote the majority of the conversation to the conversation surrounding FC/WoWS - almost ashamed to have liked two movies that are ""for douchebags"" and dancing around what makes the movies really tick. 

Whereas online they're boiled down to inane, simple platitudes. ""FC/WoWS are movies about toxic masculinity that glorify toxic masculinity, made for an audience of chauvinistic morons to misinterpret to suit their own behavior."" It's boring and shallow and it's too bad such great movies get reduced to the meme versions of themselves in online discussion. 

FC specifically is also a very nuanced movie, and it's one of those that everyone swears there's one big obvious interpretation of it yet if you asked 100 people to discuss its themes you'd get 100 different answers (which is good! and interesting!). So the smug commenters have that awful combination of insisting something is simple when it's actually very nuanced.",3
movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"For the record I really wasn’t trying to start a big argument with you specifically over your short comment. I was just commenting on it as a general thing, that it’s too bad it gets discussed so much and giving FC as an example of another spot where I think it’s overstated.

Yes, I understand that you were exaggerating and did not mean every single man in a generation. But you, and other commenters on threads and podcasts from the past, do imply that there’s some statistically significant amount of viewers who are negatively influenced by watching this movie. I just disagree that that number is significant. It’s not a whole generation, obviously, but I don’t think it’s even 1% of men who watch these movies. But it’s discussed way more than 1% of the time these films come up. And I disagree that you can point to YouTubers or just any dude online being toxically masculine and say “WoWS had something to do with this, these men are inspired by Jordan Belfort.” I don’t agree that there is any real reason to believe that they are connected in any meaningful way on anything resembling a large scale. 

But I do think it stands to reason: if you think these toxic online men were inspired by the film then the film does create an ethical conundrum. I don’t agree that these films are inspiring them, but a person who does would have to face that conundrum. Simply put, if you think the film inspires questionable ethics on a large scale then the creation of the film itself is ethically questionable. I don’t believe the creation of the film is ethically questionable, because I don’t believe there is a meaningful correlation between the film’s release and the toxic behavior of online men in its aftermath. 

I’m sorry to be antagonistic and I really am not trying to blow you up. Just clarifying what I mean. Your sentiment in your original comment is a common one, and I simply think it’s an overstated concern/point.",1

We’re on a default movies subreddit; this place is full of idiots. I may well be one too. Do I need to scope out MMA gyms? Cigar shops? Wall Street? Gaming competitions?

movies,1glr420,Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome.,"Sorry, I think you misunderstood. The movies are bad *because they're bad.* They're badly written. Even if you ignore how bad they are as adaptations, they're bad as comedies and bad as action movies.

So you asked how changing the cast would serve the story, but there isn't really a story to serve. It's just poorly-written slop.  You're basically asking me, how would ketchup and mayo improve this shit sandwich? And I'm trying to explain, no, man, ketchup won't help. 

That's my point. The movies are slop, so you can cast anyone you want and it won't change anything. I'm not saying the casting made the movie bad.

It's just that Jackson had to intentionally go out of his way to ensure whites only casting, which is what makes them white power fantasies. 

I also notice you haven't bothered to explain how Jackson's whites only casting served the story - again, because it doesn't, and I think you know that.

In response to the film's depictions of black people and Civil War history, African Americans across the U.S. organized and protested. In Boston and other localities, black leaders and the NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to have it banned on the basis that it inflamed racial tensions and could incite violence. It was also denied release in the state of Ohio and the cities of Chicago, Denver, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Minneapolis.

Of course, they're neither - the writing is terrible and they pander heavily to wannabe alpha males.

These movies are very much touchstones of the racist online zeitgeist. I'm not ""fixated,"" I'm pointing out a simple fact. Whether he meant to or not, Jackson hijacked the entirety of geek subculture, and in turn a huge chunk of pop culture in general for these guys to claim as their own. 

Those movies are what they're referring to when they say ""this is what they took from you."" Of course it never ""belonged"" to them, and it's not been taken away, either. But that fictional, idealized past is essential to their victim mentality worldview, and that in turn fueled movements like Gamergate, and that has a direct throughline to the intense right wing extremism in the US today.

As someone else pointed out, Kinberg seems like someone who works with the studio and gets things done. I wonder who will be chosen to direct. 

Personally, I feel overwhelmingly that the best move for Star Wars to make would be a true *Old* Republic film trilogy set thousands of years in the past, as that would present the opportunity to give this saga a fresh start, with breathing room to work.

Regardless of your thoughts on the ST / the franchise under Disney, what helped make Star Wars (especially the mainline films) such a powerful part of pop culture is the wait between trilogies and anticipation that comes with it. It gives time for actors to age and space to develop a vision that is informed by current filmmaking and storytelling trends and the wider world as well. Ep. 7 was able to get away with the 10-year gap since it was continuing a different story than the prequels, but this being a likely continuation of the sequels (in some way) so soon, even if this comes late in the decade, after that trilogy (and how divisive it was) is a mistake.",0

movies,1glv5nx,Lucasfilm Taps Simon Kinberg To Write & Produce New Trilogy of 'Star Wars' Movies,"Good God, was that Deadline article written by AI or a mongoloid? There are numerous errors in it. Deadline is one of the most definitive trades in Hollywood, and you would think that their writing staff would be held to a higher standard. I’m baffled by the lack of quality.

Now onto the story itself: Simon Kinberg is one of the most hit or miss filmmakers in the entire industry. But honestly, I think he’s a very good choice for this, as a writer. I am a big fan of the majority of his work on the X-Men franchise. I know that Matthew Vaughn was the main creative force behind First Class, but Kinberg committed a lot of his creativity to it. Also, I am a huge fan of Apocalypse. I thought that it was tremendous, even though most people aren’t too high on it. However, Dark Phoenix is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my entire life, but that’s truly because Kinberg was stretched far too thin on that project, and should’ve NEVER been the one to direct it. Simon is NOT a good director, and he should absolutely stay the hell away from the directors chair on this one. 

Kinberg is perfectly okay to be involved in this as a writer and producer. If y’all recall, Simon was actually the very first person to have a SW project release under the Disney banner, as he was the main creative force behind the early seasons of Star Wars Rebels. He’s a very solid pick to flesh out a trilogy. 

I really and truly hope that Disney will have learned from their mistakes from the sequel trilogy, in the sense that they need to have a definitive story for all 3 films before they start work on the 1st episode of the trilogy. If they shit the bed on this, this will be the death rattle of the entire franchise. This whole thing is already circling the drain. They need a huge win more than ever. 

So is this going to continue the story of the sequels?? Are they consolidating the  Obaid-Chinoy Rey film into this?? That film has seemingly been in complete development hell, after getting scripts from Damon Lindelof and Steven Knight, and both of them then leaving the project. And from what I read, both of those treatments are very vastly different. 

I am quite sure that the Lindelof version didn’t even have Daisy Ridley in it. I am pretty sure that the plan was to move way into the future, and to cast Helen Mirren as an older Rey. I lmao that’s a wild ass idea, but that’s what I remember reading about from Jeff Sneider, who is probably the most reliable scooper outside of the official trades, as Jeff most recently called the RDJ as Doom casting about 2.5 weeks before Comic Con. And he was very adamant about the Lindelof script and the details I previously mentioned. 

I am just really confused as to what these sequels will even be. When they killed off Kylo/Ben Solo, they pretty much murdered any chance of having a cohesive sequel. Following his character on a redemption arc thru the galaxy would’ve been a MUCH more riveting tale than anything that they can do with Rey. But I assume that there is going to be a whole New Jedi Order type tale being told. 

I imagine they will bring back the remaining members of the cast that are still around. I expect to see Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, Chewie, Zori Bliss, Jannah. Maz Kanata, Beaumont, Billie Lourd’s character, Snap Wesley, and potentially we will see force ghosts of Luke, maybe Yoda, maybe even the likes of Anakin, Ahsoka, Obi-Wan?? I think it would be dope to have Rey consoling a force ghost Jedi council to help her rebuild the Order? After the finale of TROS, with Rey being “All of the Jedi” they should find a way to incorporate that. 

Honestly, I am not very confident in the depth of the story that can be told from here. I have virtually no clue what they will do for a villain. Perhaps they should dust off Darth Talon? Personally, if I were making these films, I would immediately go back to the art of The Force Awakens & I would take the concept of The Jedi Killer & flesh him out into a full character. There’s really awesome potential with that character. 

All in all, my excitement for this trilogy is about a 4.5/10. I am not thrilled with where they left us at the end of TROS. There aren’t any dangling story threads left to explore. The mainline Skywalker Saga is officially finished at this point. There’s no more conflict. And I really think the New Jedi Order storyline would work better as a Disney+ series than it would as a trilogy. 

I think that SW needs to desperately move beyond the Skywalkers, move beyond the current timeline, either see into the past or deep into the future, take some risks and give us something entirely new. 

I am not sold on this trilogy even getting made. I’ll believe it is coming when I see the first trailer for Ep 10. Who even knows how far slob in development this thing even is? I’m guessing Kinberg JUST came onto this as a replacement for Steven Knight. I don’t think that the Obaid-Chinoy Rey film is going to be a standalone, I believe that this is a part of that same project.",0

The two major flaws of the sequels were butchering one of the most beloved optimistic movie characters and having Rian come in and contradict everything the first movie established.  He probably would have made a great standalone Star Wars film separate from the trilogy, but letting him screw around with the story and legacy characters doomed the sequels.

Edit:

Sorry guys I’m getting my movies mixed up. The rise of Skywalker contradicts the last Jedi.

True artistry is a risk, it doesn't have guaranteed returns on investment, to be creative is to risk failure, but investors investing hundreds of millions of dollars don't want to accept any risk.

Which is why they never allow anyone with a real artistic vision to have true control over a big-budget project like a Star Wars movie, they hire hacks who are willing to have their entire script constantly revised after being run past focus groups and after marketing teams check to see if enough boxes are checked to appeal to every demographic imaginable.

movies,1glv5nx,Lucasfilm Taps Simon Kinberg To Write & Produce New Trilogy of 'Star Wars' Movies,"After years of being disappointed by these big budget movies, and wondering why big budgets don't result in high quality, I've come to a realization. (This happened a while ago, but my belief in this realization has only gotten stronger since.)

It's *because* of how big their budgets are, that this is the kind of ""talent"" they hire. It's *because* of how high their budgets are, that the end-product is garbage.  
These kinds of budgets come with strings attached, investors want to feel certain that they'll get their money's worth, so they demand that every single line in the script is run past focus groups, every aspect of the movie is designed to appeal to as many different demographics as possible, meaning that the writers and directors are allowed zero creative freedom.

Truly talented artists don't want to work under those conditions, for good reason, so they work on smaller budget productions that give them more artistic freedom, leaving people like Simon Kinberg to pick up the slack.  
You'll have up-and-coming writers/directors who work on one or two big budget movies but then cash out and start working on smaller budget movies where they have more creative freedom, that's what Rian Johnson seems to have done.

And then you have people like Simon Kinberg, who just keep making these kinds of movies over and over again, resigning themselves to always just going along with the whims of corporate boards and never having any creative freedom.  
It's not even that writers and directors like this aren't talented, it's just that their talent doesn't lie in creating art, it lies in being able to appease soulless corporate suits who wouldn't recognize actual art even if a painting came to life and slapped them in the face.",1

The previously attached creators like Damon Lindelof, Rian Johnson, and Steven Knight are auteurs, who always want to do something more ambitious and different, which result in clashing with the executives. They left, so Lucasfilm would be looking for the safe options, who will not fight, have no vision, do their job on time.

The fate of the Galaxy being decided by men with laser swords being a serious thing when there are people around with guns is a very fragile idea, and ridiculing it because you're too cool for this nerd shit is perfectly fine if you want to make fun of Star Wars, but I have no respect for someone doing it when they're supposed to be engaging in a cooperative project thats bigger than they are.


Rogue One threw out a bunch of Star Wars lore and broke a lot of the rules and got away with it because at its core it didn't have contempt for the setting and told a very good story in the process.

The silliness in the original trilogy was always controversial TBF, just as the relative seriousness of Empire was, star wars has always existed in a weird balance.

I think what made them seem particularly egregious is they found multiple ways to break the existing visual style, the 50s look, the scooters not matching with established vehicle designs and behaviours, and the cyberpunk/cybersigilism type stuff that to me doesn't fit with star wars which I think should be grounded in late 70s tape-deck futurism, but it particularly doesn't fit on the Dune inspired Tatooine",-1

IMO the biggest one is Kylo's motivation. It's not easy to think of a reason why the son of Han and Leia, being trained by Luke, would turn to the dark side. But deifying his grandfather was a reasonably good way to do that. So a good followup would have had a deeper dive into why he wanted to ""finish what [Vader] started"". Instead, Johnson had Snoke tease Kylo about his helmet so he'd take it off and abandon what little motivation had been established for him.

> JJ set things up without knowing what the payoff was

More important than the failings of TLJ is the fact that Kathleen Kennedy, as the person in charge of these directors, didn't force them to establish a coherent 3-film story arc ahead of time. I blame her failure to lead more than either of the directors (even considering how horrible TRoS was).",2

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Unexpectedly emotional for a sci-fi film. One of Nolan’s very best.,1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,I did not see this in theaters.,1

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Could anyone help me understand when tickets will be up for grabs? I’m looking for one of the Canadian locations and I see the locations they’re being held at for the 70mm showings but don’t know where to find ticket sales for them. Are they not open yet?,1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Seeing this in Imax is what its made for. An absolute experience seeing it the first time. Hope to get into this run!,1

They had only three locations for canada and today when tickets were supposed to go on sale they removed two locations from the site. Now the only place to watch this in Canada is Saskatchewan.  Lmfao. What a sad rerelease.",1

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Where can i stream it?,1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Fuckin garbage anniversary. Barely any theaters and AMC released tickets earlier than what was announced so NYC imax shows were sold out by the right time came,1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Okay it seems like some of these comments are from bot accounts. How is no one talking about the truly LIMITED theaters this is in? It’s showing in like 7 super random cities. Am I missing something?,1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,"I don't like this movie like everyone else, I mean, it's good,  but it kind of falls apart for me.


Having said that, watching it on the big screen was an unforgettable experience. I remember Nolan saying that seeing 2001 as a kid changed his life, and this was clearly a love letter to his passion for cinema and his influences.",1
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Never bought movie tickets so fast in my life. Can’t wait to experience this on the big screen,1

My oldest is 10, wondering if I should take him, as I’m not sure if this will come out in theaters again. He’s seen all the avengers movies until Infinity war and endgame (might be too intense/too much death).

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Damn good poster. Movie was decent too but some of the beginning with the son and the granddad were pointless,0
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,"I saw it when it came out, liked his stuff a lot. Thought it was an okay movie, but not as good as promised. Really felt like the premise had clear problems as a mission in the first place, they would have known the time dilation planet would have been a bad idea before they landed so it kinda cut into the returning scene that is always talked about for me.  I couldn’t suspend a lot of my disbelief enough. It was like sci-fi was cool, but the people made no sense.

 It’s like they didn’t match the logic of the universe they lived in. Not quite sure how else to put it. 6/10, worth it for some cool scenes but not as cool as other Nolan stuff.",0

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,"I simply hated the social media addiction segments where they jam the camera all up in the protag's face to watch him weep. >!Yes, he's passing up on the life he could've had on Earth.!< Why torture him with this shit when his mission is so fucking important? Mental health isn't something you take so lightly when >!all of mankind rests on you keeping your composure and your cool for decades!<.

As well, Anne Hathaway's speech about >!the power of love felt like the kind of watered down trite garbage littering b-movies throughout the 90's.!< It felt completely out of character, like she suddenly reverted to a daydreaming 13 year old schoolgirl having a big old tantrum in the church parking lot because mother didn't approve of her interracial lover or some shit.

Finally, the resolution. >!A wizard saves the day. How? A wizard did it. No but really? No, really, it's a fucking wizard. You thought this was a hard scifi movie?

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,Massive demand for IMAX showings of this since Oppenheimer success,3
movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,I was thinking the same. 10 years isn't that long. The movie is still fairly popular on streaming services. It was re-released in IMAX a couple of years after its initial release.,0

movies,1glr2ws,Official 10th Anniversary Poster for Christopher Nolan’s ‘Interstellar’,The only thing that bugs me is Matt Damon's twist into an evil character.

But I see what you’re saying.",3
movies,1gm8hi4,Murder By Death. Set the standard for all of the greatest absurdist murder mystery comedies of ever.,"See, I'd agree with you, but my big issue with this movie (and I *like* this movie, it's very funny) is that when it comes to parody it's actually quite shallow.

I get the feeling Neil Simon had heard of all these characters he was spoofing and sort of got their premise, but didn't really *understand* them. If you've actually watched or read the works the characters come from, everyone's *wrong*.

In the case of Wang, him being a super dodgy Chinese stereotype is basically his *only* trait. Like, watch any Charlie Chan movie or read one of his books, that's not *even* a trait he has. The character was specifically created *not* to be a stereotype, to strike back against the ""Fu Manchu"" type portrayals of Asians that were popular at the time. Hollywood didn't get that, and the poor casting decisions reflect that, but he still had other traits. Even Sidney Toler, hard as he is to frigging look at or listen to today, was a more nuanced portrayal.

Everyone's a little like that. The Poirot parody is just effete and hungry. The Sam Spade parody is just a cynical creep. The Miss Marples parody is...actually just sort of present, I think the only jokes Simon could think of went to the nurse, and they're just ""she's old"".

But I *really* can't get past what he did to Nick and Nora, my favorites, my number one ""Goals"" couple after Gomez and Morticia. ""They drink and they're rich"" seems to be all Simon had heard about them, so he filled in the blanks himself. ""Well, obviously that means they'd act super classy and sophisticated and be emotionally distant and unaffectionate with one another"". Wrong! First of all, only Nora was from a wealthy background, Nick was a tough and streetwise New York flatfoot who adjusted his behavior 0% when he married into money, and all his friends are criminals. Nora herself was more of a party girl who had classier taste but otherwise was completely on Nick's level behavior wise, and the two constantly bantered and flirted. And they sure as hell didn't treat murder as some fun diversion to distract them from being rich, Nick actively tried to avoid getting involved in the mysteries, but his sense of justice and loyalty to his friends would always drag him in anyway. David Niven and Maggie Smith are amazing actors, but these two stiffs they're playing are NOT Nick and Nora, they're not even parodies of Nick and Nora, because they have nothing in common with Nick and Nora whatsoever!

...Sorry, needed to get that off my chest. Guess the Nick and Nora thing was bugging me more than I realized.",1

Set the standard for all of the greatest absurdist murder mystery comedies of ever.,"I'm not saying the film is Tolstoy or something, but there's no way it's just a Yellowface stereotype, when it's specifically a Charlie Chan spoof, a spoof of the portrayals of Charlie Chan.

The music is fantastic, you’ve got all the players coming through - even all of the side characters - and then Bob Uecker as the announcer is just perfect. He brings it to a whole other level by narrating the play on the field so dramatically - and his comedy during that final game comes across differently than it does in the rest of the movie, almost perfectly encapsulates the anxiousness of MLB playoffs and the decisions players/coaches make. I’m a Cleveland sports fan so I’m biased, but I just think it hits on all the stuff that makes playoff baseball so special, and it doesn’t overstay its welcome, the movie ends right there and the team ultimately fails to win the WS (as we learn in the sequel).",2

Although, previous to that, I'm actually surprised to see how frequently he's had misses as well. Going through his entire portfoio it seems he has some really good movies interspersed in a pile of relatively bad ones: 

Alien and Blade Runner in '79 and '81, but then doesn't put out another heavy hitter until Thelma and Louise ('91) and then another lapse until a winning streak between '97 and '03 with G.I. Jane, Hannibal, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and Matchstick Men. Then another lapse until American Gangster ('07) and then another until The Martian.

Also, this movie invoked Barbarian a bunch especially towards the end, both with its beats and imagery.     

With that being said, I really really liked what I saw here. The three main performances are great, I really dug the mediation on fanaticism and religion. I’m not religious but I do appreciate how the movie doesn’t outright dump on it (that’s kinda tired and played out at this point). It shits on Mr. Reed for being a complete fucking goober more than his views on religion.

It’s also incredibly fun and goes in places I wasn’t expecting (even though at the end of it, it reminded me a lot of Barbarian).     

It’s probably a bit too high but 8/10 for me",7
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Loved the slow-burn/tension building for the first half.  Especially the Monopoly/Radiohead analogies.

As it was it went in, I didn’t know what to expect which I loved.  But everything revealed in the third act…. eh?  Seems like a lot of horror movies have third act problems this year.

Hugh Grant is definitely having a moment at this stage of his career.  A few legitimately funny moments.  I think I need to let it marinate a bit more, but I would give it a solid 4/5 stars.",12
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"This movie is both insanely clever and compellingly dumb at the same time. Builds tension phenomenonally and pulls quite a few bait-and-switches, but I wanted more.

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Loved pretty much everything about this. Hugh Grant gives a riveting performance, and I love how the ending is open to interpretation. 

There’s a lot to say about this one so I’ll sit and let it digest, but the best scene from this movie IMO is the whole The Hollies/Radiohead explanation.

Also, I did not notice Topher Grace in that role at all. ",5
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Had a really good time with Heretic. It's simple and fun and definitely doesn't feel like something that's definitely going one direction or another. Hugh is the obvious pillar of this movie, but from the guys who did '65' I was pleasantly surprised with the direction and tension. Hugh Grant doing American Psycho monologues and dismantling belief systems is an amazing elevator pitch and I felt like it didn't drag or fall into predictabilities. 

Hugh's late career continues to be such a vibe, honestly. I liked this movie a lot and it was clearly built to need someone like Hugh. Someone who relishes in the fun, remains unpredictable, and could charm your absolute pants off. He's playing so much with not just his dialogue but also the silent spaces. You can almost feel his façade fall off when he starts lumbering down that hallway in the first act and the scene where he's presenting the two doors was just some incredible direction and performance. He's, like, waiting for them to come to the obvious conclusion of what they have to do and you can feel him salivating over the conundrum he's about to present. 

It's a fun movie to watch and has a lot to teach us about board games and chord progressions, but the way it plays with the very idea of belief had me pretty well engaged. From the moment they knock on his door he's always presenting them with statements that may or may not be true and holding the mirror up to their disbelief in him but their belief in religion. The blueberry pie candle, the hilarious ""hubby"" mugs and thermos, it all builds up to his whole theory of the ending that if he shows you resurrection and gives you no reason to doubt it, who's to say he can't convince you to live in a cage. 

There's a bit of a final girl switch, I feel like? I get tired of trying to keep up with when subversive circles back to predictable and vice versa, but I had assumed Sophie Thatcher would be the final girl with her more interesting relationship to faith and her confidence in beating him. Made for a great surprise when the switch happens. This movie certainly has its moments of gasps or gross out, but it's really more of a mind bender thriller. It chooses its wild moments carefully, I felt like. Once the switch happened I realized that I did like Chloe's character more even if I'm not the type to have faith. She gave me Alicia Silverstone vibes and it was just a very earnest performance. 

All in all, solid 7/10. It's no masterpiece of tension and religious critique, not a lot here to surprise anyone who has gotten into this conversation with *that one guy* in college, but Hugh and the two leads elevate it so much and it's got some fun surprises in store. Also, absolutely hilarious that Topher's grace has ZERO effect on the outcome. That was a solid twist, or perhaps lack of. I didn't even realize that was Topher until his second scene when he started talking.",16

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Personally loved the monologues and religious debate they had going the whole movie. Didn't love the ending, but it worked well enough.


I was kinda hoping they would either go full supernatural horror movie and he really discovered an old god, or have him be just a harmless but creepy man who wasn't lying and really was gonna let them go out the back. Just build and build and build the tension and then relieve it with a jokey ending.",4
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"This movie has the most twisted villain I've seen in a while: 

A serial killer who reddit arguments you to death 

Sorry, I seriously did not like this movie. The acting’s great and so is the direction but so much of the movie is just a smarmy r/atheism mod forcibly video essaying these two random missionaries to death. It feels like a internet argument disguised as a horror movie. Scenes that should have been tense and scary just became monotonous because the dude just would not shut the fuck up. It just dragged on and on and I actually thought the movie was like three hours

Which is a shame because I was really liking it the first half hour, the tension was palpable… but then he went in-depth explaining three different metaphors for a basic religious argument, and I slowly began to realize that this was what the whole movie was going to be. And the entire time I just kept thinking “there are two of you and Hugh Grant is a 64 year-old man who hasn't physically done anything intimidating even when close to you, at least *try* to kick his ass”. 

Perhaps it’s because I was overly online as a teenager in the early 10’s and got into a ton of religious arguments with, but I just knew every argument as soon as he brought it up and was impatient with him dragging it out. Perhaps to normal folk it's fucking groundbreaking, but none of points wasn't anything I haven't seen innumerable times before.",35

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"I thought the first two acts were really strong. But that the third act felt like it needed something to challenge the directors to do something a bit more impactful.

The ending wants to leave the viewer trying to figure out what they believe is true. Which fits with the theme. It just felt kind of rushed, maybe a little cheap. 

Compare that to The Lobster. It ends by asking the audience to make the choice for the character. Would you go through with this thing or not?

Heretic also wants you to decide what you believe. It just kind of feels a lot less impactful and lingering than The Lobster.

I totally thought that they would play Get Free by Lana Del Rey at the end but knocking on heavens door made alot of sense for obvious reasons. I loved Sophie Thatcher's cover of it. 

This movie was way funnier than I expected! I love how disarming Mr. Reed is at first and then as the film progresses, he gets more and more unnerving to the point where it becomes more uncomfortable rather than comedic. 

I liked how Sister Barnes was dressed in all black symbolizing how she was more firmly planted in her faith as opposed to Sister Paxton who wore grey and pink. She's newer to the faith and has this bursting passion.",2

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Hugh Grant is great in this I think he’s gonna be doing some really good stuff in his older years. 

I thought it was pretty good except I found they relied heavily on exposition at parts where I think could’ve been explored more cleverly, instead of just telling us exactly what happened. And really the girl just figured all that out to a T, like going off script? Really? Wasn't a huge fan of the camera movement in the 'study' room, they focused too much on the girl's reactions while Hugh Grant was cooking off screen. Sister Barnes rebuttals to his religion claims were also non-sensical especially the holocaust one, if it never happened and the Jewish population growth was at the same rate from 1945-today, they'd still only make up ~0.29% of the world population

I also can’t get behind some of her character choices which are usually the crux in horror movies. 

Did anyone else not notice the elder was Topher Grace?

I feel like the directors probably wrote this after watching the original Speak No Evil and hearing the antagonists answer to why they did what they did, ""Because you let me"".

In real life Sophie Thatcher is an ex-mormon, wonder what that was like for her playing this character and 23 year-old Chloe East married a 32 year old mormon",1
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"As someone with a Mormon background, I loved this movie. I want to watch this over and over to find all the details and symbolism I can. 

Sister P was the one quoting scripture about going through trials of faith (I don’t remember the exact verse she used), which I think was fitting based off the ending. 

Speaking of the ending, I thought it was a very similar shot to the typical imagery we’re shown of the first vision. She’s knelt in a grove of trees. Instead of spring (which could represent being surrounded by life and new beginnings) it is winter (surrounded by death). A ray of light falls on her and she raises her hand up to see a (vision?) of a butterfly. Another miracle. Whether it actually happened or not we don’t know, also like the first vision story.",1

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"7/10 - As others have said, really enjoyed about the first 85% of it, with the last bit falling a bit flat for me. Not totally fair to blame the movie for not going the way I thought/wanted it to go, but MAN if sister B had actually resurrected and saved her friend, that would’ve been such a nuts way to end it. She’s back to life, our boy is dead, and suddenly everything they thought they knew is called into question. Suspending disbelief was tough when the girl who bled out 10 minutes ago suddenly got up, grabbed the nail board, dome’s Hugh grant, then dies again. Not sure if I’m missing something like Sister B never came back to life, it’s just in Sister P’s head the whole time, etc.

Again, hard to blame a movie for not going the way I wanted it to after the fact, but it did fall a touch flat for me. If we’re going to have a relatively standard anti-religion character, seems much more fun to have him actually be right and turn it to 11 with the crazy at the end!",1
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Really enjoyed Hugh Grant in this.

A lot of the specific things he's saying are obviously very played out and things you might have heard before, but what makes it still fun is how he's so obviously full of shit, how it's all clearly part of a big game to attempt to manipulate Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East. Like when Chloe East points out that he's improvising about the simulation thing: he didn't mean any of that stuff just like he didn't mean any of the rest of it. Overall he's very funny.

I agree that it probably would have been more interesting if they had put something actually supernatural in there. I didn't like when he actually sliced Sophie Thatcher's throat. Hands-on violence made him into a more ordinary villain than he had been established as so far.",1
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"This movie fell in a weird position with the third act reveal that it was all just a control scheme by Mr Reed. Within the story it needs to be, that underneath all his monologuing, grand standing and supposedly great discoveries, this religion is just another scheme of control and manipulation by a convincing and charismatic con man.


But from a movie stand point the reveal is rather generic and straight forward, and as such the ending just falls flat. The moment it is revealed everything was just manipulation and he is just your ""average"" woman abuser, all tension evaporates. On one hand it is a compliment to how the movie manages to make you believe there is something big and mysterious hidden in his basement, contrary to all the signs, but pulling that rug means that you as a viewer sat through all that talk just to get the generic and uninspired third act of every run-of-the-mill ""woman locked in with crazy man"" thriller, and it feels wildly disappointing.",1

movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],What was up with the Infernal poster on his wall?,1
movies,1gm9nrh,Official Discussion - Heretic [SPOILERS],"Mr. Reed takes an academic approach to studying religion, and  trying to find proof of which one is the truth. I think his belief of all of it is true or none of it is, is wrong. It's a very binary, factually based way of looking at it. 

He bases this on religions sharing similarities, therefore must be iterations of the original. He concludes this original truth is simply a means of control. 

From that he gives the girls two choices, Belief/Disbelief which I think are false pretenses. When Paxton says ""simulation theory"", he corrects her emphasizing ""hypothesis"". You can have a hypothesis, conduct an experiment, and then have a *belief* from the result.

The commonality with every religion is not that certain deities were born December 25, or they were ressurected from the dead, or crucified. One of them even has a bird head! 

It's that they all require Faith. When Paxton is dying the man who stabbed her, killed her friend, and has done horrific things asks to her to pray for him, she's does. She didn't the have evidence or proof that Reed was searching for, but for the iteration of religion she grew up being told was correct, she had Faith her belief that it was the right thing to do. And for her Faith she gets paradise/enlightenment/rebirth, whatever you want to take from the butterfly metaphor.

This is my opinion within the context of the movie, and not so much my actual thoughts on life. I do have similar thoughts, albeit not in the literal afterlife sense.",1

I went into Heretic knowing that it was going to be a discussion on religion from both sides and that’s what I was most excited to see.

Can see this one being too slow for some folks but I found the tension very high and the topics utterly fascinating. I also can’t see why someone would want there to be a supernatural creature, that’s missing the entire point of the film and its themes.

The story is about religion, for most of it, and Mormonism in particular, being a way to control and manipulate young women. For that narrative to make its point, he has to be a bullshitter, a charismatic con man who really gets you close to believing there is something bigger and miraculous happening.


The rug pull makes narrative sense, but it evaporates the big expectations it sets up, and the third act becomes extremely generic as a result as it is something we have seen a thousand times before in movies, young woman must escape psychopathic man. At that point, I think most movie audiences indeed prefer to just be taken on the crazy ride the villain promised us for nearly an hour and a half than get something so run-of-the-mill.",7

At the end of the day I think that's what this movie is about and is challenging. Mr. Reed's theory about religion ends up being kind of disappointingly simple after all the build up - religion is people that want control, and people that let them have it. And we simplify something complex into ""people are dumb sheep."" 


And in the end the missionary challenges that narrative - not about whether religion is true or false - but she refuses to let him simplify her story and tell it for her, or decide what it means to her.",3

Obviously I want the director and crew to do well and continue to be able to make projects, but if the reported budget for this movie is correct. I doubt it’s making a huge profit even with a three month delay. The minecraft movie comes out 2 weeks before and will probably sweep and overshadow this just like Super Mario Bros did all of its Spring competitors. This is my second most anticipated movie of next year and I want to see it as soon as possible. A flop also doesn’t guarantee that it’s the last chance a studio will give the filmmaker. Damien Chazelle and Ari Aster both weren’t sent to Directors jail after their bombs, and Beau Is Afraid is my favourite film ever as of now.

I guess they had a tough time marketing it and used the strikes as an excuse to delay it. It took them a long time to release a trailer when the VFX was done a while ago.

Korean movies have an odd energy that is hard to translate to American sensibilities, especially the acting. Okja and Snowpiercer are fine but I feel like Bong Joon-ho‘s strictly Korean work is much better overall. Not a perfect analogy but it’s like when anime movies get an American dub and it’s so stale and lifeless compared to the original voice acting. It’s just not the same.

There could be money issues, there could be somebody that dies \[while making\] the picture, the studio changes heads and the next person hates it.

The original lean 132 minutes version that came in theaters is by far the superior version imo, there is also a US version that is slightly shorter and adds a happy ending that is not as bad as the long one.

An argument could also be made about the longer version of Léon: The Professional, as the longer version has more sexual untertones and is less ambiguous than the one released on theatres.",1
movies,1gmai93,Worst director's cuts? ,"Dawn of the Dead (2004)'s director's cut feels like it was the second to last edit before shipping the theatrical version. There are a ton of superfluous shots, unnecessarily lengthened scenes, and generally stuff that adds nothing or even looks cheap and bad. Some stuff you might not notice, but will definitely feel off if you've seen it before. Like how we didn't need an extended slowmo closeup sequence of CJ pointing the gun at his zombified partner before shooting him. Or of Norma dragging on a cigarette just before walking into the store where the baby scene happens. That kinda stuff really feels out of place and wanky.

On the aforementioned baby scene, that's probably the most egregiously changed bit of the whole movie. In the original, Norma and Andre shoot each other, the rest of the crew find them, along with the dead zombified Luda. They see the bundle in Andre's hand, pull the sheet back, zombie baby screams, hard cut to outside the store and a single gunshot rings out. End scene. Perfect. 

In the director's cut, the sheet pulls back, zombaby screams... Ana says 'oh my god' really blandly, very slowly raises the revolver, cocks the hammer back, intakes oxygen, exhales carbon monoxide, I check my watch, *then* she shoots.

Completely ruins the scene. Both because it was interesting in the original that it's ambiguous who shoots the baby, and we get to fill in the blanks on how they feel about having to do so, and because it just disembowels the pacing of it.

This cut is especially annoying because it's hard to find a good quality version of the original theatrical cut, because the director's is generally the only one available. And it sucks. 

I think there's a 'collector's edition' somewhere that has both cuts on Blu Ray/4K, but it was limited edition, and for some reason only the unrated version was in 4k. The theatrical was 2k. Feels kind of insulting.",1

Halloween 2: I don’t hate this movie as much as everyone else does. It’s more his own movie than the first which was a remake remix thing, and this one was more original, unhinged, and flat out crazy at times.

movies,1gmai93,Worst director's cuts? ,"Adding an insider’s perspective to this - movies as written and filmed often end up way, way too long. Too long for studios to be happy, but also too long to keep an audience engaged in a theater. Scenes that look good on their own may not enhance a film as a whole, or may make it feel slower and less purposeful. Cutting one scene (such as one connected to a subplot that was planned) may require cutting multiple scenes, so that the movie is more structurally sound at the end. Directors (and their editors) spend a very long time refining their theatrical cuts, and while director’s cuts can be magical, they often also feel indulgent and slow.",5

Ridley Scott says in the intro to Alien that the version that was released is the one he wanted. The studio wanted alternate cuts as a selling point for the box set. Most movies are not classics that had their vision botched by a studio. Studios just want to find new ways to sell existing products. I personally have always hated the (too) longer JFK and Amadeus cuts. I appreciate fixing the fx in Star Trek - TMP but still like the theatrical better. Same with Blade Runner. Fixing the glitches was good, but the story was intended to be narrated and it feels off. The long versions of Aliens, The Abyss, and T2 really just don't work for me.

movies,1gmai93,Worst director's cuts? ,"The workprint version, at least from what I remember was more from Michael's POV into his descent, rather than making him to be more like Carpenter's force of nature like the theatrical went with. This carries over to the actual Halloween night as an adult (Laurie and friend's are more minor characters). Danny Trejo's character was more like a cameo than a vital character, and I don't remember him dying in this version. Editing was a little sloppy, and that was definitely improved on the theatrical cut.

Like the second movie, the soundtrack was different, and better.

It was definitely a rough cut version of the movie that was going to be worked on regardless of the infamous leak or not, so I'm not sure if the theatrical cut was the way it was because the cuts were deemed necessary, or if the changes happened to recoup some potential box office profits that might've been lost because the leak happened by promising that it'd be way different (it's what got me in the theater in the first place).",1

Finally choosing to reveal the truth and lies in his life and career, Leonard sits for an extended filmed interview with his former student Malcolm, charging ahead with candid stories about his younger self in the fractious 1960s and beyond. At Leonard’s insistence, his wife and indispensable partner, Emma, hears it all.

To me it perfectly deromanticises gambling and sees it as a hobby for weirdos where being dead-eyed and literally soulless is an asset.

For a much, much better representation of gambling culture and the average experience of a poker player, *Mississippi Grind* is as good as it gets. Ben Mendelsohn’s performance is the exact archetype of a real life gambler.

I dont think Schhrader or Scorse give a shit about the sport or trying to be accurate representation. 

Its a character study of a kind of person who would excel at the sport because  certain negative traits actually help. 
If wife beaters and torturers are good at the game then what does it tell you about the morality of the game?  Thats the real question here.
These  are both movies about prople who are both good at the game but also good at it precisely because they are completely fucked up. These are not going for charisma or sadsack pathos. Heck both movies end the sports part with the main guys just giving up and ""losing"" . These aren't movie about feeling sad for the players or cheering for winners but being revolted by them with some understanding of why they act like this. 

Scorsese/Schrader so very clearly have a low opinion of the sport or at the least interesyed more in the dysfunftion of players and don't really see any virtue whatsoever in participating in then,winner or loser. They are interesting because they are paradoxically shallow and two-dimensional.


The reaction to Tell/Lamotta shouldnt be ""yep that's how most boxers act/that's very sad/thats how it really be at the casino "" but more ""that's kinda fucked up but I get it"". They are suppouses to be a view from the outside of the fan bubble with all the sheen and glitz and perceives depth scrubbed off.

I couldn't think of a worse movie to  watch as a gambling/cards fan than Card Counter or a more hostile movie to watch if you are a boxing fan than Raging Bull.

If somebody made a movie about how press rooms are unbearable to be in and journos are sick,morally corrupt people that would be closer to the tone of Raging Bull and Card Counter and no doubt people who idolize journalists would say that it's a poor representation. Richard Jewell was kinda like that.

These are both a very jaundiced bordering on comptentous takes on the sports genre and off-putting by drsign.

The reason there is so little ""world-building"" is because Scorsese/Schrader don't think the ""world"" is that interesting to begin with. You can tell Scorsese went deep into how casinos operate in Casino cause he is very interested in all of it but Schrader really isn't cause he finds the ""world"" as shallow and banal amd dead behind the eyes as the lead character himself which is why he is such a good fit.

After that, it’s just Dafoe screaming. And because it wouldn’t really make any sense for the men to be taking turns—the moment Dafoe has the upper hand, he’s out of there—I read it as Isaac visiting Dafoe’s sins upon him and using the brutality he taught against him.",1

Bit of a slow burn but you may never find a more reflective and contemplative film than A Man Escaped (Bresson 1956). Not a traditional war movie as much as it is a film set during World War 2 about a prisoner of war. Very touching and despite the title is extremely tense.

Paths of Glory (Kubrik, 1957), is another really great film this one set during World War One is maybe the most emotionally compelling film in his oeuvre.

Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1914) is a really powerful post war Italian film that shows the longer term aftermath of WWII and the effects of rebuilding on a family.

The animated film Grave of the Fireflies (Takahata, 1988), often cited as one of the saddest films and I would be inclined to agree. It is a very powerful look at the impact of war on innocent children but the film is very unrelenting. 

For some more contemporary picks 1917 (Mendes, 2020) was a really tense and amazingly shot film. Jojo Rabbit (Waititi, 2019) is a really touching and funny film although some people were less fond than others. The Zone of Interest (Glazer, 2023) is fantastic, but with the current political climate might be a bit intense.",8

The Bridge over the River Kwai,

A Bridge Too Far, The Longest Day (both classics from back in the day)

Casablanca, Life is Beautiful (both set in world war 2 but not really war movies; Casablanca is notable in that WW2 was ongoing when it was released.)

movies,1gm0gnb,Please help me find a good war movie to watch tonight with my sister,"December 1986: *Platoon*

June 1987: *Full Metal Jacket*

August 1987: [*Hamburger Hill.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMZfJk7LoK4)

Overlooked by an audience exhausted with what was still a new genre, *Hamburger Hill* is the definitive futility-of-war Vietnam movie.

Where the other two films deal a lot with interpersonal relationships and colourful characters, *Hamburger Hill* is about grunts on the ground just doing their job without knowing why, best summed up by a line perplexingly cut from the trailer:

""Blackjack wants us to take this hill.""

""What's he want with it?""

""Pave it over and turn it into a parking lot.""

They don't know why they're doing things, they're just following orders and trying to survive while not thinking too deeply about it.

The big thematic difference between these three films is that while *Platoon* and *Full Metal Jacket* involved fragging - the killing of one soldier by another - \*Hamburger Hill'\*s equivalent scene is about friendly-fire. This is a devastating scene not because of casualties and reactions but because of what it says about the entire situation.

The film is also an important one because it depicts 'the real story' behind some of the lies that the American public were told about the Operation, and includes a scene recreating part of a 1969 news broadcast that played a major role in shifting public opinion.

It's worth quoting the poem that appears at the end of the film, written at a time when veterans were returning home to be spat upon and called baby-killers (something covered in the film):

""If you are able, save for them a place inside of you and save one backward glance when you are leaving for the places they can no longer go. Be not ashamed to say you loved them, though you may not have always. Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own. And in that time when men decide and feel safe to call the war insane, take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you left behind.""

Come and See (1985)    
Trailer: https://youtu.be/UHaSQU-4wss?si=N3dpgqqmjtACR-4f

One redditor's review of it:    
Watched this one last year, was high as shit off edibles at the time, and was absolutely blown away by the brutality and horror on display here. Watching this, I came to the realization that every war film should be a horror film, and that’s exactly what’s accomplished in Come and See. It should also be noted that the title is derived from a biblical passage thats related to the rapture/apocalypse. I would describe this film as surreal and apocalyptic, which seems like a perfect representation of WWII, especially the Eastern Front. Unimaginable brutality and mass death, very difficult to watch, but you can’t look away. I felt transported to a time that is frighteningly close to the present. People don’t think enough about how recent these events are in human history, and this work is a reminder of the horrific acts of brutality that we’re capable of as humans. I’ll never forget this movie, and would consider it essential viewing. Take edibles at your own discretion, might make things feel too real for some people.


The film was made using real captured nazi surplus, they used live rounds and the actors went through hell. All trauma was real.",1

Zimmer:

>“It’s called ‘Dune: Part Two,’ not ‘Dune 2'. The story starts the second we finish the first movie. We are still within that story, those characters, and it would be foolish and completely uncinematic to go and write new themes for the characters instead of enlarging the theme.”

movies,1gl4ole,‘Dune 2’ Score Submitted for Oscars Despite Not Meeting Eligibility Requirements,"> The Academy’s rule on music eligibility for sequels is clear: “In cases such as sequels and franchises from any media, the score must not use more than 20% of pre-existing themes and music borrowed from previous scores in the franchise.” Zimmer’s score for “Dune: Part Two” incorporates key cues from the 2021 film, which many believe may exceed the Academy’s 20% threshold.

I'd watch a YouTube breakdown of how that's calculated.

Howard Shore won for Fellowship and Return of the King but wasn't nominated for Two Towers. Was it because of this rule? Or maybe cause he submitted Gangs in 2002 instead? What percentage of Two Towers was determined to be pre-existing? What percentage of Return of the King?",545

movies,1gl4ole,‘Dune 2’ Score Submitted for Oscars Despite Not Meeting Eligibility Requirements,John Williams reuses words while Zimmer reuses sentences,1
movies,1gl4ole,‘Dune 2’ Score Submitted for Oscars Despite Not Meeting Eligibility Requirements,"For more context:

The Fellowship of the Ring won an Oscar for Best Original Score.

The Two Towers was *not even nominated* for that same award because it contained some themes from the first movie. *Any* re-use was supposed to be disallowed under the then current academy rule. However, this snub lead to enough of an outcry that the rule was modified to the 20% rule, though not in time to allow The Two Towers a nomination. 

However, the change did allow in order to allow The Return of the King to be nominated, which then went on to win another Oscar for best original score.

So, falling afoul of the 20% rule is falling afoul of a rule that was already changed to allow sequels to re-use themes as long as *enough* of the score for the second movie is original.

That said, there could be arguments to what is original vs not, if a theme is being ""re-used."" I would not count, for instance, leitmotifs woven into the score as making that entire section of score ""re-used"" if it otherwise is significantly different.",244

Prior to 2000, there were multiple times where ""Best Original Score"" was actually called something else, or otherwise actually two separate categories, making it very hard to figure out what, if any, rules were present at the time.

That was obviously the complete opposite of the point - everything is in decline by the time of RotK and Minus Tirith really is the last stand for men.

To have it immediately followed by a second huge battle is the theme of the entire film - war is relentless, it grinds people down. And it shows us how far the world has fallen. From the grand scenes of the Last Alliance in Fellowship, to a rag-tag collection of people on top of a mount causing one last desperate distraction…

I think the one thing the film could have done is shown how far Gondor had shrunk, and that the Northern Kingdom no longer existed at all. But with adult eyes the film shows the decline pretty well already.",1

movies,1gl4ole,‘Dune 2’ Score Submitted for Oscars Despite Not Meeting Eligibility Requirements,"I've understood the Old Duke as a matador for 20+ years my dude.

And since I lack Bene Gesserit precision I could not quite recall if this was explicit but checking he is explicitly described as a matador with a magenta cape. This is on page 67 of my edition between Jessica speaking with Leto and meeting Shadout Mapes for the first time. 

Actually this might make a nice bit of encapsulation for why I don't care for Villeneuve's actual choices. Herbert gives us a matador Duke a grand and theatrical gesture that's maybe very small but very in keeping with Dune's role as the Anti Sci-fi. The future is not the future, but the past come again in all its aristocratic grandeur, decadence, and (going over to the Baron) deeply human corruption. 

I see only faint traces of that in Villeneuve's movies. The Atreides are stark, stoic, and morose military men, with frankly a look that says fascism to me more then anything else. Not for nothing given the ""both sides are bad, imperialism bad"" undertones underwriting Paul and Chani's little spat. And to keep the Harkonnen's worse they go from corrupt and decadent to... monstrous baldies that shop at the H.R. Giger store. 

Bah give me the old miniseries, that will be my cinematic Dune for all its obvious limitations.",2
movies,1gl4ole,‘Dune 2’ Score Submitted for Oscars Despite Not Meeting Eligibility Requirements,"Almost every single movie composer working today has what are called “additional writers” or “composer’s assistants”, who are frequently uncredited.

This is as true for composers of major blockbuster films, as it is for composers who work on small indie productions. It is standard practice in the film and TV scoring industry. This is how modern film and TV production works.

You can get a detailed explanation and industry insights from this working composer, with some commentary about the controversy of this practice within the industry:

https://youtu.be/Gn7ihBrWKyE

Here’s another composer’s explanation of it (skip ahead to 2:18):

https://youtu.be/jOkoptwKx_s

Bottom line is this — a lot of people who don’t know how the industry works constantly post this information about Hans Zimmer’s assistants as if he’s somehow the bad guy, or is lazy, or untalented, etc. But he is actually one of the first to talk very publicly about it, so much so that he often brings attention to the actual assistants that work for him, helps them get their own gigs, and supports them in their own personal careers, so a lot of composers who worked for him are now well-known in their own right.

So the real truth is that while the practice is definitely not without controversy, it is in fact STANDARD practice in the industry, and of all the people involved Hans Zimmer has been the one guy who publicly championed his own assistants and helps them establish their own successful careers.",2

I actually thought he has done well playing the villain/antagonist mean and tough dude in the few movies he has been in. With all the tattoos he will probably mostly be the drug dealer, criminal or some sort of underdog type thing.

Looks like he is playing himself in this one though. 

> Dear Santa also features a cameo by Post Malone, who plays himself. There's a scene in the film that calls for the kids to go to a concert, and Bobby says the rapper was their top pick ""because I love Post Malone, and I know that kids that age love Post Malone.""
> 
> ""So he played himself, which isn't the easiest thing for anyone to do, believe it or not, and sang a song. But he was great, and he was so much fun to work with. I would love to work with him again,"" the director adds of the singer.

movies,1gl0mqk,First Images from the Farrelly Brothers' 'Dear Santa' Starring Jack Black as Satan - A young boy accidentally mixes up his spelling and sends his Christmas list to Satan instead of Santa.,"And Jack Black as Satan.  Like, I actually dreamed of this film.

A boy writes a letter to Santa but misspells it Satan.  Satan has his list and promises to honor the whole list in exchange for.... his soul.  Jack Black takes him on a magical adventure to get this boy all the things he wants for Christmas.  And this is a very short montage of typical shit kids want and just Jack Black having a great time with this kid.

And then Satan takes the kid back to his home and he looks at the final item on the list.  ""I want my parents back.""  It zooms out, the kid was in an orphanage.  And Satan is looking around the room and the kid only has one decoration, it's a news clipping of his parents being.... MURDERED.  Better add that easter egg in an early scene for the audience to get a hint.

So after some light fighting and Jack Black yelling ""FINE FINE FINE"" they go to heaven.  The only one who can help grant this wish is Satan's father.... God.  And the part of God goes to.... Mel Gibson.  And it turns out everyone in heaven is douchebags.  And you get a line like ""why do you think I left"" and an explanation of how Satan came to rule hell and how he's actually an angel who cut off his wings to fight the man.  And obviously you get this juxtaposition of a child who lost his father and one who is rebelling against his.

When he finally gets to God, God informs him that this little dude's parents are in purgatory and either have to choose to go to hell for all of time or wait 100,000 years (BUT THAT'S A LONG TIME!).  The boy and Satan unlocked the parental purgatory freezer unit and.... they're douchebags.  They don't want their son.

Kid is sad, goes back to orphanage.  Satan comforts him and offers to come back every year to spend Christmas with him.  Quick montage of the boy getting older and older until he turns 18 and leaves the orphanage.  God offers Satan back his wings, Jack Black turns them down because he feels like he prefers to be around the mortals.  God understands and is proud of his son.

Not necessarily a bad thing, for the bulk of Jack's modern filmography it's more a bad thing because they're just going for ""Isn't Jack Black funny"" but it's not always that level of lazy. It sometimes is because the look the actor naturally wears is just what the director is looking for. A good example, Marty Supreme is making Timothee Chalamet wear a rather unique look for him. But in Dune he fit the look naturally of Paul. And I doubt anyone would call Denis lazy for going for that. Conversely, every time Jason Momoa has a role they often don't have a look in mind, they have Jason Momoa in mind. And naturally, in Dune they decided to tweak his look a fair bit because he's not being Jason but Duncan. I'm sure if Jason didn't pick it up they had other Duncans in mind.

So, streaming deals. It's literally the only thing getting comedies like this and a lot of other movies even made. Here's a clip of Matt Damon explaining: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlWb4vjaJBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlWb4vjaJBI)",11

Anyway, they shot it last spring and the production crew expected a theatrical release for either last Christmas season or this one if post ran long.  I suspect the Farrelly Brothers aren't crazy happy about it.

As an aside, we spent a week on the shoot for his scenes.  It was a lot of fun, but the school is supposed to be in New England, in winter, and they shot it in late spring in Atlanta... 80+ degrees every day... so all those kids wearing coats you see are absolutely roasting.

You’d think a famous rapper would have more appreciation & gratefulness for the genre. 

You can say the same things about country he said about hip-hop, also.

They also have the shorter quicker shoots so they can get whatever reasonable rate from the actors mixed in with the extra pay by making it so they can spend half the time working on a Netflix movie and be free to go bang out more films.

They often come to realize this by the end of the film.

In the type of movie I'm thinking of, the main character is usually presented as level-headed and ""normal"" at the start, and the second character is typically odd or exaggerated.  As the movie progresses, the odd character starts to impact the main character's life for the worse, but the other characters usually don't see it.  This leads the main character to feel like they're losing their mind and they start to act erratic.  There's not really a ""buddy-ness"" to it, they don't learn from each other and grow typically.",7

>Following the success of The Incredibles, Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre. 

I don't think it's fair, or accurate, to call Incredibles 2 not a good film. It made more than double the theatrical run of the first film. The studio that made both films has a track record of focusing on story over genre beats.",2

Obviously that’s slightly reductionist, but idk, geez, after the first movie spends so much time setting up the whole family as a power group, they strip all that away again and make you wait until the final act to get back to that point again.

movies,1glc1qb,‘The Incredibles’ 20th anniversary: Remembering Pixar’s Oscar-winning superhero film,"To reiterate, the original was special because no one had seen anything like it before. Not just in terms of animation and the way each character’s abilities are integrated, but also in terms of story and the dynamics between characters. That’s what made it feel so fresh and exciting. But the sequel had none of that novelty going for it. The only other huge superhero movie in 2004 was Spiderman 2. It was a completely different media landscape. 

With the sequel itself, I disagree with the take that it’s a “bad” movie. It is however a lackluster follow-up, and it’s frustrating because they passed up so many easy opportunities that could have elevated it to the level of the first one. In my view, the obvious choice after 14 years would have been to do a short time-skip. Age all the characters up by a few years and show them being comfortable using their powers and fighting villains as a family. I wanted more gags about getting on in age while still having super-strength or an elastic body. I wanted to see how everyone would deal with Jack-Jacks absolutely broken abilities when he’s NOT a baby anymore. ",1

I can see Tombstone, Whiplash, Good Will Hunting, and the Social Network being consistently popular and talked about, and Howl's Moving Castle is a lot of people's favorite Ghibli movie, and also favorite animated movie. But the rest I think are pretty underrated especially The Five Heartbeats. For years I thought it was a real band.",2

Randomly saw this movie about 15 years ago on HBO at like 2 or 3 a.m. I'm not usually the ""subtitle"" type of audience due to having problems with my eyes ever since I was little so unfortunately, they tend to distract or take me out of the immersion when viewing something I've never seen before. However, even though it was a foreign film and subtitled in Spanish, it's still to this day one of the most original movies I've still ever seen. Without giving anything away or any Spoilers the basic plot is:    

 Luck/Odds/Chance. A small, secret organization recruits individuals who've been subject to or proven that fate shows favor to them and for whatever reason, they always seem to be luckier than others (not like Domino in Deadpool lucky though, just that the odds are always in their favor). We meet this organization/group when they offer the main character a place in a multiple round tournament due to him being the lone survivor of a commercial plane crash that killed everyone else on board. The tournament has games of chance like running as fast as they can through a forest of trees blindfolded with their arms tied behind their back and the last person to not kiss a hard ass oak tree in a full sprint face first wins that particular round. They (the games) get more dangerous as they advance rounds. Don't think ""Squid Game"" as it's nothing like that and came out in the 90s or early 00''s.

* Sunshine. In fact, there's a tiny chance somebody may recognize me as the one always defending the third act and trying to reframe the way people view the movie as a whole.


* Speed Racer. I was very vocal amongst my group of friends and on both fb and 4chan when trailers for Speed Racer first started popping up. I thought it was going to be awful. But on my birthday I decided to go see it in the theatre on a whim and ice been singing its praises ever since. So it's nice to see that it's gotten a pretty vocal cult following since then.


* Bunraku. Insanely visually creative, absolutely STACKED cast of all-stars (Ron Oerlmam, Woody Harrelson, Demo Moore, Josh Hartnett, Kevin McKidd) who all knew exactly the kind of creative art house film they were in. And when I say visually creative, I mean it. The movie is named after an ancient Asian style of puppetry/theatre, and the movie's cinematography and set pieces are designed with that namesake in mind.

Personally, I think it's among the best films ever made. Even more so if you watch behind-the-scenes stuff and learn that they had to shoot the singing plant scenes at half speed. So Rick Moranis has to move at half speed while shooting opposite a giant practical plant puppet that was he size of a bear in some scenes. Crazy cool stuff and the very core of the idea of ""movie magic"". It all works so well. 

It's not a top 10 for me, more likely a top 15 or so, but I'd also add ***Death To Smoochy*** to the list. While it's a film I love, it falls just outside of top 10 territory. But not due to its quality. I truly love that movie. I feel like the only reason it's so low-rated is that it came out in the wake of the September 11th attacks in New York, and moviegoers just weren't ready for a pitch black comedy right then. However, I saw it after it came to home video, so it was several months removed for me. Maybe even a year removed since I didn't pick it up right away. Great film.

I dug Sunshine out of my friend's pile of homemade bootleg DVDs and watched it alone, quietly while everyone else slept. I finished the movie in the dark basement then stepped outside at dawn and took a deep breath of fresh air. I was at the peak of calm and relaxed. Then I found a tray of Oreos I forgot about in my car as I drove away. A few minutes later I was walking in to the dentists office and realized I just ate half of a tray of Oreos on my drive to the dentist. My calm and relaxed state was disrupted.

That doesn't really have anything to do with the movie, but for some reason my memory of that night/morning is extremely vivid.

I ALWAYS saw Nolan movies in IMAX until my local theater moved to digital. I remember it vividly. It was Dunkirk... Okay they added some preshow content, weird but okay. Wow a lot more trailers, weird but okay. Movies starting... WTF!? Are those pixels? Why is my Nolan movie in pixels!? They're like an inch big!


Between the poor image quality for any IMAX that's not laser and the seats they keep in the theaters that haven't kept up with the industry... I'd usually pick the standard AMC experience over IMAX. Dolby is my gold standard.


I may be a picky bish on this, but I was a projectionist for 7+ years covering the film to digital switch and I can definitely tell a difference. Overall, digital projection is better in almost every case, but 70mm is so much better than IMAX digital that they barely deserve the same name.",1

Usually it’s better because it’s the vision the director had when making the movie and the studio made them change it for a variety of reasons.

Well, The 1955 version of Tuntematon sotilas is the best version of the film, given that a number of the actors actually fought in the war and very much knew the subject material. But there will be dozens of people nominating Tuntematon Sotilas (Unknown Soldier in English), so I'll go for something else.


Star Wreck I only really added because it's an ammusing shitpost in cinema form that was released for free and can be found easily if you're interested.

Funny side story! Back in like 2011 I read in the LA Weekly that John C Reilly was playing a free show at a church in Santa Monica. Being a big Walk Hard fan, I dragged my 2 drunk & reluctant friends with me. We show up and it's inside a small, emptied church with the band set up where the alter would be and everyone seated on carpets on the floor around/in front of them (less than 100 people total). I was all excited and picked spots for us right in the front row center. It turned out to be not Walk Hard-type music...but more..folksy? Kinda chill & def more like singer/songwriter vibes. I was star-struck, sitting at the great John C Reilly's feet; unfortunately, my drunk friends were less impressed & proceeded to straight up pass out in the front row 🤦 i cannot tell you how embarrassed I was..ill never let them live that down 😹 So that's the story of the time I got to sit at John C Reillys feet while he serenaded my passed out friends! 🖤",54

Yeah... no. That's not *Grendel.* *Grendel* was doing a Dostoevsky riff. Grendel was the sick-but-self-aware monster who randomly and unceremoniously got got by a Nietzschean madman, who was quite obviously a different kind of monster.

A reader who's paying attention will be left with all the same uncomfortable questions that are raised by the ideological conflict between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche. Beowulf demonstrates that he is more formidable and less burdened by arguably self-inflicted suffering. Grendel dies in part because he spends too much time wallowing in self-examination and self-pity and not enough time honing himself into the baddest-ass version of himself. He doesn't go out into the world and kick ass. Instead, he farts around being low-key shitty until some ass-kicker comes and does the predictable thing to him.

All of that is to say, using the word ""good"" in relation to basically anything or anyone in the book *Grendel* is woefully misguided.",11

We were both walking up the stairs to the same panel. He was super nice and welcoming and helped me find my way to the right room. I was nervous because it was my first art convention on my own so I was happy to find a friendly face to help. We stepped into the room and walked to the seats. I stopped to sit down but he kept going straight up to the front! I didn’t realize I had just met the very person I was there to see! It was a lovely panel and I will remember his kindness for the rest of my days. RIP Greg Hildebrand.,1

* Bombing scenes are absolutely intense.

* A bit too long for me. I appreciate it incorporates a lot of different elements: British imperialism, race, upper-class opulence, Dickensian villainy, etc. but they don’t mesh together. And I feel the pay off from scene to scene is just not there in-between the intense bombing scenes.

So for them to diverge for part of the British politics surrounding the time, and mix in the actual perilousness of the bombings, was a bit weird for me. I’d recommend it, but I still think there might be another film to be made about the bombings",3

movies,1gm9nsl,Official Discussion - Blitz [SPOILERS],"Very solid movie, although never really hits that emotional high or exceptional poignance I love McQueen so much for. His movies always look great and handle tough topics with great respect and this was no different, the way he can highlight such simple and powerful emotion is always special. That said, it wasn't the most compelling story or characters, although a lot of the side characters were great. 

This movie does look incredible though, especially the big war set pieces. The kid crossing the bridge as a plane crashes into a building, the big night club swing scene that ends in a bomb siren. So many visceral moments of war in this shown through the eyes of a very confused kid. 

Ronan continues to be the highlight of her projects, but I need to shout out Benjamin Clementine and Stephen Graham for being wonderful character pit stops along the way.

movies,1gl2gpf,'Red One' Review Thread,"If people really want to know why did it cost that much, [TheWrap already reported it:](https://www.thewrap.com/dwayne-johnson-red-one-late-budget-problems/)

> Originally slated for release during the 2023 Christmas season, the “Red One” theatrical release has been delayed to November 2024 — supposedly due to last year’s labor strikes. 

> But the real story is a lot messier.

> Production issues — ranging from Johnson’s chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set to producers’ inexperience — caused costs on the movie costarring Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons to spiral upwards to a final budget over $250 million, a sum more fitting for a superhero tentpole.

> According to more than a dozen insiders directly involved in the project, the “Red One” production was a perfect storm of problems compounded by the inexperience of the film’s lead producer Hiram Garcia of Seven Bucks Productions and Amazon MGM feature and production executives Julie Rapaport and Glenn Gainor, who are overseeing the project.

> Insiders told TheWrap that Johnson showed up as much as eight hours late to set on the movie — forcing the crew to shoot around him on some days. On previous films, Johnson has made a habit of peeing in a water bottle to save time, upsetting crew members.

> “On set, away from his trailer, if he needs to pee, he doesn’t go to the public bathroom,” one insider who knows the movie star well said. “He pees in a Voss water bottle and his team or a PA has to dispose of it.”

> Amazon was hoping to launch a potential franchise with “Red One,” which is about a villain who kidnaps Santa Claus from the North Pole, after which an E.L.F. (Extremely Large and Formidable) operative joins forces with a bounty hunter to find Santa and save Christmas. The script was written by frequent collaborator Chris Morgan (a longtime “Fast & Furious” scribe) and directed by Johnson regular Jake Kasdan (the “Jumanji” movies).

EDIT: More from the article:

> Insiders also accused Johnson of breaking strict quarantine rules on the set of “Red Notice,” whose cast and crew were sequestered, by flying home in a private jet. “He was frequently flying home and breaking the extremely strict rules of the bubble,” according to an insider. Johnson himself posted about working a 14-hour day, only to delete it — which the IATSE Stories Instagram account resurfaced — after crew members called out his hypocrisy, with one writing, “He got to host family and friends for a BBQ, and wound up getting Covid anyway. Most selfish thing I’ve ever seen an actor do.”

> An individual close to production denied that Johnson broke quarantine rules. “Nothing he did was in violation of COVID protocols,” said the individual.

> Crew members working on Johnson productions tend to make their guild minimums to qualify for health insurance. One crew member on “Ballers” who spoke to TheWrap, said, “because of a 14+ hour day on location, where he did not come out of his trailer to come to set until after 3 p.m. on a 7 a.m. call, I qualified for health insurance.”

> The examples of Johnson’s tardiness are numerous and well-documented, from showing up late to fan events to leaving entire sets idle while he was off doing three-hour workouts. 

> Earlier this month, he was three hours late arriving ahead of his main event match at WrestleMania 40, two insiders told TheWrap. For WWE World, a WWE fan event in Philadelphia leading up to WrestleMania 40, Johnson showed up two hours behind schedule, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from the local Philadelphia press.

> According to a WWE insider, Johnson’s late arrival was due to other WWE commitments, as well as traffic in Philadelphia on the way to the WWE World venue in Center City.",385

Even the blair witch which is like literally mostly people walking around the woods pretending to be scared cost $60k. I will mention paranormal activity beat it by costing only 15k to make.

Horrors pretty much the only genre you get away with prices these low and returns that big and its actually incredible how it can amplify small movies in a way no other genre can.

Insidious was $1.5 mil., Inisidious 2 was $5 mil., Insidious 3 was $11 mil., Insidious The Last Key was $10 mil., Red Door was $16 mil.  All of those are cheap movies. That's only $43.5 million for all fiver movies, or $8.7 mil. average for one.

The Substance, to the extent that it really has a monster (and nitpicking that feels like part of the point of the movie, to be clear), never takes the monster *off* camera once it shows up except for very brief reaction shots.

The honorable mention I was thinking of was In a Violent Nature, which is literally a monster-POV movie.

e: To be clear, since I put them in a weird order, my ranking of those is Substance > Smile > Terrifier, but it's frankly very close. Rest of my top 5 is IaVN, as mentioned, and Stopmotion, which actually doesn't really have a monster per se.",11

The movie’s whole point was to make you feel what tedious is and it achieves that. Kind of like how the end of M Night Shyamalan’s Glass was purposely written to subvert the audience’s expectations and leave them feeling disappointed.

The narration is all about how methodical and removed he is, and generally he tries to act that way until push comes to shove multiple times. I think it's more about how you can set all of these rules and beliefs for yourself, and life just isn't going to let that happen.

movies,1glw8ea,Movies like The Killer (2023) ,"I too found it extremely funny and loved it, but I am not entirely sure why.

I laughed at the moment after that fight scene with him struggling to limp away and saying ""This is what it takes."" in the most serious voice imaginable.",2
movies,1glw8ea,Movies like The Killer (2023) ,"Yes that’s true but the fact that he’s a literal psychopath means he’s more of an extreme on the human spectrum.

Dude keeps saying how awesome of a hitman he is, and, sure, he isn't bad, but the reality is that he isn't particularly great either. His skills are quite average, and it's pure luck that gets him out of a lot of tough situations. That same luck probably helped him live that long.

My only guess is the shot is meant to break up perceived monotony from having to watch people talk for an extended period of time, but it is an ugly shot that to me, displays a lack of confidence in not only the material, but the audience. I hate it so much.

I call it the Procedural Slide because I used to mostly see it in procedurals, especially shows like NCIS, CSI, Hawaii 5-0 (remake), etc, but really it's everywhere. It also helps my annoyance when the name I've assigned it makes it sound like a stupid wedding dance.",5

movies,1gll80p,Cinematography choices that bother you?,"There's a few that drive me absolutely crazy...

**The modern trend towards underlighting scenes to the point they're near-indiscernible.**  A few months ago, I was watching a video about digital cinematography, and I saw a cinematographer borderline gloating about how ""beautiful"" the image he made was, because digital cameras made it possible for him to light a character with a single small light-source.  And they were showing this image he was super proud...  and it was basically just a pitch-black screen with the slight *HINT* of a character's profile where a flashlight kind of was hitting his nose and chin.  It literally just looked like a little bit of light reflecting off a blank screen.

That cinematographer (I don't remember who it was) should never work again, because it was honestly pathetic how proud he was over making a *bad* image where you couldn't see anything.  Please stop underlighting scenes just because you can, Hollywood!  I like to be able to actually *see* what I'm watching...

**Gross low-contrast color-correction, especially when combined with clinically-sharp digital images.**  If you watch a lot of modern movies, you inevitably have noticed the weird trend where contrast is totally trampled down (creating kind of a flat-looking, semi-gray image) and colors are overly desaturated, often with a slight tint to a color like green, brown or orange.  One lady coined the perfect term for it...  it's the *""Intangible Sludge""--* an image where it looks like someone quickly went through and wiped some sort-of nebulous muddy substance over the lens before they rolled camera.

And when you combine that with the almost clinically-sharp look of modern digital cinema cameras, it gets even worse.  It looks both over-sharp and under-detailed at the same time.  It doesn't look ""professional.""  It just looks like you took someone's poorly-filtered Instagram videos and threw them onscreen...

(The best comparison I saw was a side-by-side of the original *Dexter* series and the revival from a few years ago.  Original looked nice, naturalistic and cinematic.  But even with modern cameras, the revival looked like it was filmed on a potato thanks to the bad color-correction, contrast and cinematography...)

**This seems to thankfully be going away, but HFR (high frame-rate) cinematography is ugly, unnatural-looking and can (literally) give people headaches.**  Oh my god, I want to leap through the screen and smack the people who try to argue it's *""more realistic-looking.""*  Real-life doesn't look like that!  First of all, it tends to greatly reduce natural motion-blur, which makes live-action footage look unnaturally smooth and almost ""animated.""  Second, it's pushing so much more ""information"" into your brain that it subconsciously makes everything feel fake and makes you notice mistakes more.  Third, it can make certain people feel light-headed or nauseous, especially if you're prone to visually-induced motion sickness.

At best, HFR should be an occasional gimmick like 3D, and not something that filmmakers try to shove down our throats.",4

\#1. Lens flares, and I'm not just talking about the obviously glaring ones J.J. Abrahams likes to showcase in his films. The subtle ones can be included as well. The ones that nearly spill over and around an actor (i.e. the subject).

Example #1: [https://cdni.fancaps.net/file/fancaps-movieimages/7762665.jpg](https://cdni.fancaps.net/file/fancaps-movieimages/7762665.jpg) (from ""Licorice Pizza"")

\#2. Handheld cinematography in general, and not just aggressive shaky-cam. I'm talking scenes, especially in modern movies, where the camera's not locked and has to subtly free-range around the frame like it's captured from the perspective of a drunkard.

Example #1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRVhkcEfci0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRVhkcEfci0) (from Max's ""The Penguin"")

Example #2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFTAi90ubt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFTAi90ubt0) (from HBO's ""Chernobyl"")

\#3: Scenes shot at a 360 degree shutter angle. The ""Michael Mann/Roland Emmerich's '2012'"" look. One that is mostly prevalent with movies shot entirely or partially on digital cameras, and even in some cases, movies shot entirely or partially on film stock that have such smoothened, non-sharpened motion blur effects added in post.

Example #1: [https://youtu.be/HKyswzGF4jo?t=108](https://youtu.be/HKyswzGF4jo?t=108) (from ""Twisters""; This is a movie shot entirely on film, but for some reason the aerial establishing shot featuring all of the moving vehicles on the road heading for the twin tornadoes is suddenly smoothened to look like it was filmed at 360 degree shutter angle, despite the fact that such an effect can't be achieved with film cameras, as they can only go up to the traditional, more cinematic-looking 180 degree shutter angle. So I have a feeling that such a effect was probably digitally added in post instead).

movies,1gll80p,Cinematography choices that bother you?,"Cinemascope aspect ratio. Too wide and overused, especially when it comes to character-centric films. I've almost never seen a film that had justification to be cinemascope all the way through. Certain shots, for sure, but not all the way through.

Sure you could attribute this to poor composition, but there's also the practical aspect to consider: Most films are going to end up on a TV or other 16x9 aspect ratio apparatus. Cutting off that much of the visual area makes it hard to watch unless you're made of money or sit REALLY close to the screen.

Even then my point still stands; taller ratios are better for intimate moments, so even when properly composed, I think the industry can benefit from moving away from scope as a general aspect ratio and should consider univisium 2:1. I've cropped many a movie down to 2:1 in VLC media player and I lose almost nothing barring a few exceptions.

At the very least scope should be replaced with the old 2.20:1 Todd-AO 70mm or a 2.25:1 format, if not replaced AND having the ""general shot"" format become 2:1, this way you could use an even wider 2.5 or 2.67:1 for those specific ultra-wide shots when needed.

Oh, also 24fps. I'm not an HFR shill, but there's no reason that we should be fighting over HFR vs 24 when the perfect middle ground of 30fps exists and is universally applicable to standard projectors (instead of needing special HFR projectors) as well as Bluray discs.

30fps when done right can look just as cinematic as 24 and the slightly increased smoothness really is easier on the eyes. 30fps would be great for animation as well, even given how animation goes ""On 2s"" and ""On 3s"" and whatnot. 15 is nicer than 12 and 10 is nicer than 8 while still being close enough to get that feel across whenever a certain method has to be used for a given sequence. Hell, 30fps on 3s would almost be as smooth as 24fps on 2s, and given how choppy 24 on 3s and 4s can get, I'd welcome the improvement.",0

 People always love to talk about how Paul W.S Anderson ""ruin"" their favorite franchises, but is funny how a lot of cinematic franchises he started did actually got ruined the moment he left.

 Mortal Kombat: first successful videgame adaptation that was very liked by the public and made a good profit, it got a sequel in which Paul didn't work and turned to be one of the worst movies of all time and it killed MK in cinema for like 2 decades. 

 Resident Evil: Literally the most commercially successful action-horror franchise of all time, 6 movies, 1.2 billion in the box office ans countless amount of money in home media/streaming, all over Anderson leadership. The moment he left the RE franchise and it got a ""faithful"" adaptation we got the first RE movie that lose money at the box office with Welcome to Racoon City.

 Alien vs Predator: The first movie directed by Paul was very liked by fans of both series and it was a success in the box office, but again he didn't work in the sequel and it became a massive flop and generally hated.",7

movies,1gl2mfr,Milla Jovovich to Star in Action-Thriller Movie 'Protector',"Resident Evil Afterlife made 300M on a budget of 60M. Retribution made 240M on a budget of 65M. The Final Chapter made 312M on a budget of 40M. His relationship with Screen Gems crumbled, but those films kept Anderson's career going when projects like Death Race, Three Musketeers, and Pompeii all disappointed at the box office.


In a sense the films after 3 were cash grabs because the studio decided to milk the franchise after the (at the time) ""final"" movie, but they're also very oddball entries that prioritize whatever flight of fancy Anderson was having over raw commercial appeal. That's why Afterlife/Retribution are so strange stylistically (let's reinvent the entire visual identity of this franchise because 3D cameras are neat), and also why Screen Gems took a hacksaw to Retribution -- it was way too weird and confusing for their blood.",13

movies,1gl2mfr,Milla Jovovich to Star in Action-Thriller Movie 'Protector',"I would argue that the Death Race series nosedived once Anderson stepped away. He consulted on story but otherwise had no other involvement, and there's a stark contrast between his 2008 film and the direct to video sequels. The DTV sequels by other people feel tasteless. His 2008 film is violent and sexy, but it has class. The 2008 film has a slightly mocking tone where the female sex appeal is present, but has this ""hmm.. this all seems a bit gay"" thing going on, wheras the sequels have a strangely demeaning view of women that comes off as gay in the same way some rap music that's misogynistic towards women comes off as gay. (Think ""Do the Homie"" from The Boondocks which was satirizing that mistreatment of women.)

It's honestly like the flirting vs harassment meme in film format. Anderson's Death Race is flirting. Death Race 2/3/etc. are mean spirited harassment. The Death Race sequels are not terrible per se, but you feel Anderson's absence so keenly.",2
movies,1gl2mfr,Milla Jovovich to Star in Action-Thriller Movie 'Protector',"Such a silly argument I don't know where to begin. 
Terrible sequels don't automatically make the first film great nor Anderson a great director. What sort of stupid logic is this. That is the case of MK and AvP. Not to mention the anticipation from the built in fanbase would have almost guaranteed a level of success for those films. Regarding RE each subsequent film made less than the previous film. That's not a healthy franchise. Successful franchises back then were making 500m at the BO per film. And RE made 1.2b from 6 films that were backed by a mega popular game license...wow what success.",2

You see, when Reddit was created, the upvotes and downvotes were meant for the community to vote on what is related and what isn't.  So yes, please, go do that.

That's how ALL of this works.  It wasn't designed as an ""I agree/disagree with this"" function.

movies,1gl4gxm,For an hour and 40 minutes Music By John Williams just filled me with joy ,"I always have to tell this: My brother and I are very big Star Wars fans. My brother managed a used bookstore that would also deal with records and memorabilia. He got a donation of merchandise that had a signed 1st print ANH from John Williams to Mark Hamill. He researched it to find out if authentic and got in touch with him to give it back. 

Mr. Hamill had lost it and donated some things to the store for retreiving it. That's a one-of-a-kind item that ""should be in a museum!"" - but I think should be in the intended person's collection. :)",12

movies,1gl4gxm,For an hour and 40 minutes Music By John Williams just filled me with joy ,"There is a documentary called ""Score"" (2017) and it was a really great history of music score.  In it though at one point they start talking about John Williams and you can tell how much other composers think so highly of him.  Quincy Jones, Hans Zimmer, and others talk very highly of him.  You might like that documentary as well.

One of the things they didn't mention in the John Williams doc that I thought they would, was that when they did E.T., Steven recut the film cause there was one piece of music that wasn't fitting right.  So instead of changing the music, Steven changed the movie to fit it.

>Williams was recording the lengthy and complex music for the finale of the film, and he was having difficulty synching the orchestra’s performance to the many precise cuts and beats of the picture edit. After several takes, Spielberg offered to turn off the film and allow Williams to record the music on its own, with exactly the tempi and phrasing he felt the music required. When it was recorded to Williams’ satisfaction, Spielberg then re-cut the end of the film to match this musical performance.",4

movies,1gl4gxm,For an hour and 40 minutes Music By John Williams just filled me with joy ,"Does the doc discuss his score for Far and Away? It's one of his best yet severely overlooked scores.

movies,1gl4gxm,For an hour and 40 minutes Music By John Williams just filled me with joy ,"For what it is, I got enough joy out of it. I got emotional when you realized how his music has been around since I was born but never took note til I started to appreciate composers a few years go. He has so much classic scores that you forget one cause there's so many. The superman score segment comes up and just the memories come back from childhood. It's like that ratatouille moment when the critic tastes the ratatouille dish. When he plays the piano it's played beautifully and smoothly. Broke my heart when he said he wanted to live 50 years to learn more about current music. A legend in music, say Thank you to him isn't enough. What a guy.",2

movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",I think there’s a little bit of both. He probably felt love for Calvin in a sick twisted way since he basically raised him.,23
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",He was upset. Life and relationships are complicated.,21
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","He is a product of the system he grew-up in, absorbed its values and beliefs, and became what he was to accumulate safety and power. 

He lived in the box, flourished in the box, protected the box, but was not big enough to see outside the box.",13
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","It’s an interesting potentiality but I don’t think it’s the whole picture. I think it’s a little bit of what you said and a lot more simply Stockholm Syndrome for a man who probably knew no other life outside of slavery, and had some twisted view of his relationship with Candie.",3
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","I think Steven genuinely revered Calvin but I think that came from a long history of manipulation. Calvin was the be all and end all at the plantation and in Steven's eyes he was given the privilege of being seated at the right hand of ""god"". I think Calvin probably got a kick out of knowing he could turn a black man against his brothers and sisters like that. But I also think part of his despair was a mix of emotions, not just from seeing the god he worshipped and loved fall but also, as you said, from the realisation that all Steven's power is lost along with it. He loved Calvin in an unhealthy, codependent way but Calvin was also the only thing keeping him from being ""just another black man"". I think the two are heavily entwined in Steven's psychology.


On a side not these kinds of discussions are one of the best things about movies; seeing how different people interpret the psyche and motivations of a character.",3
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","I’m literally watching Django Unchained right now, Steven is about to show up. 

He 100% is truly upset, he was crucial part of the Candyland machine",3
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","Naturally he cared, all that time spent together even if it started as manipulating would have obviously made them close... plus he obviously disliked Django and Schultz a lot, so put those together plus a bit of that losing his meal ticket too perhaps.. but I think he really did care for him, maybe in a twisted way but still!",2
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",Bit of both. He definitely seems colder about Calvin when hes alone.,1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",No he was absolutely upset. He was a committed believer in the system. He was  emotionally invested into it. It's all he knew.,1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","Hard to say. He could've had both feelings deep down inside: losing someone that's such a big part of your life and also the structure by which he lived his life was now over.

It's hard to think that anyone could ""love"" someone who not only uses you and your people as a tool but also treats you like an animal (and sometimes worse than an animal). At the same time, humans can be really complicated. Specially if you're born and live all in your life in such a toxic enviroment.",1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?","Unfortunately, what I think makes him worse is his self-awarness of everything. He understands why he's looked at sideways. He understands he's seen as a traitor and sell out, but he's also believes himself to be superior to the rest of the enslaved. Now, what I wonder is whether he saw himself as enslaved with privileges or if he saw himself as free and willingly serving.

What makes me believe he was self-aware and actually did harbor hatred and despite(n) was his change in demeanor for the final showdown. It wasn't all an act, but it was mostly an act. He understands that without Candy, his life in the house is done.",1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",Of course. Showing him not only cry but weep was intentional. He basically raised him.,1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",Some slaves love their masters. It's that simple.,1
movies,1gm8iqu,"In Django Unchained, do you think Steven was truly upset about Calvin’s death?",He also probably didn't experience the harsh realities of slavery in the same way all other slaves did.  He was basically the number one house servant for a man who's fucking loaded and lived very comfortably even for the time.  It would be like being a house slave for Jeff Bezos; it's probably not THAT bad compared to let's say working in an Amazon warehouse.  He was very willing to fill that role and fall in line.  Skull dimples aside some people just like to follow orders because it makes their lives safe and simple.  He probably thinks the slaves that are getting punished deserve it.,1

movies,1gkmlfd,"Unforgiven (1992). Damn, this movie is deep.","I have an interesting contrast in seeing two epic movies with my dads. 

A little history: my father and my step dad are the same age. They grew up in the same town went to the same schools knew the same. I love those They were both in the military in the 60’s. But, my step dad was in and out by mid’64. He was stationed in Europe and as a pretty good athlete he spent his time playing baseball in a league of teams from various bases through Europe. His memories and pictures of the military are all pretty fun and care-free. 

My father served from ‘66-‘69. He had a drastically different experience. Never really talked about it, and had no pictures that he ever shared with me other than the posed pictures from completing basic training and getting his dress green uniform. I knew he served in Vietnam, but not much more.

My step dad, who married my mom when I was 8 years old, was huge western fan. I am happy he shared this love with me. But he was always drawn to the lighthearted westerns that didn’t dig too deeply at moral dilemmas and the realities of the old west. His musical tastes ran along the same lines. He loved Elvis, and all of the pop-country of the 70’s and 80’s. He never appeared to struggle with anything and never lost his cheerful optimism. I was very blessed to have a happy, well adjusted and emotionally available stepdad. 

My father was always drawn to deeper movies. Movies that challenge you and make you examine yourself in relation to the characters and situations presented. He was an alcoholic and drug addict in addition to having chronic mental health issues. He ultimately did get sober and that made his mental health issues mostly manageable. He had a couple decades of sobriety when he passed.

I had the experience of seeing Platoon in opening weekend with my father. I was 17 or 18 and was about to or had just graduated high school. There were no real military conflicts I was aware of and I was kind of caught up in the hype being posted my way by military recruiters. For me to movie was jarring and eye opening. I was legitimately scared through most of the movie. When I would look over at my father he was almost catatonic. His mouth was kind of slack and he never touched his popcorn or snacks. When the movie ended and the lights came up he and many other men of his age stayed in their seat. He and others had tears streaming down his face. Even when he pulled it together and we left the theater I could tell he wasn’t up to talking, especially about the movie. That move completely changed my perception of my father, of war, and most definitely killed any thought I had of joining the military. 

In contrast, I saw The Unforgiven with my stepdad on opening weekend. The movie does have some genuinely funny moments and some great Eastwood one liners. He was giddy watching the movie and laughed heartily at the funny moments. When the movie was over he popped up declaring it an another great Clint Eastwood movie. We discussed the movie in the ride home and never hit on any of the deeper issues it raised nor the completely bleak and dystopian depiction of the reality of the “old west”. 

Comparing those two experiences really showed me how experiencing real war and all that goes with it leaves a man forever changed and that a part of him never came back from Vietnam.",17

It assassinates the myths about other gun slingers, it shows the sheriff to be both accommodating to the cowboys that cut up the whore, and vicious to the gunslingers that have come seeking the reward money for killing them.

Now and then, something would counter that darkness, but the underlying current was perversely depressing.

But Munny's role as an avenging angel is not one that he feels he deserves. Hence his famous line to Little Bill right before he pulls the trigger. 

Functionally, he's a much more troubled version of the role he played in Pale Rider, and if you go even further back Alan Ladd in Shane (which Pale Rider seems almost to be a remake of). In those films, the townsfolk also see the price of a man who lives and dies by the sword. And are warned by his example, despite the fact that he's ultimately the hero.

Their just cause is hijacked by a zealous extremist within their ranks, who is ready to murder everyone in the building to send his anarchic message to the world. It falls to an ex-soldier turned window cleaner, Joey Locke (Daisy Ridley) – suspended 90 stories up on the outside of the building – to save those trapped inside and take down the killers, whilst also finding a way to bring the corrupt energy moguls to justice.

Facing the loss of her career, she visits her dying father, Clyde, a former Marine, who asks her to attend a dedication ceremony for a school building named in his honor. The event takes a deadly turn when Omar Romatas’s vengeful son, Bento, launches an assault, taking hostages.

Directed by the legend Fritz Lang, who also directed The woman in the Window, which also stated Joan Bennet and Edward G Roninson. Too late for Tears is another one you won't regret watching, also known as Killer Bait. Scandal Sheet (although not really what we would call a film noir, yet a few of the ingredients are there) is a great one. Mildred Pierce is also worth checking out and in the same vein as Too late for Tears, switches the norm when it comes to fate of the main character. The strange love of Martha Ivers is another good one, staring Barbara Stanwyck and Lizabeth Scott. Film noir was only retroactively applied to what we call these old film noirs. Back then they were just mellodramas. Also I don't know why you're calling it a challenge. It's never a challenge to watch these films, some of which are amongst the greatest ever made.

WB/Discovery merger was an attempt to fix this cash flow problem--it didn't. AT&T then divested their equity for the same reason--which also didn't work.

movies,1gkcmof,Why Did Warner Bros. Bury Clint Eastwood’s ‘Juror No. 2’?,"As always, every comment is treating the headline as a question directed at them and not actually reading the article.

> But conventional wisdom around Hollywood posits that David Zaslav, chief executive of its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is ultimately responsible for withholding Juror #2’s release and marketing resources — in much the same way he has canceled completed movies, including Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme — presumably in service of managing WBD’s $40 billion in corporate debt. “Money is all that matters to Zas,” says an entertainment-industry consigliere who has ties to multiple studios and has worked with Eastwood. “His bean counters know that Clint’s movies don’t bring in money anymore. And Clint is content to make them and likely shove them onto Max or PVOD. [Zaslav] is not an emotional person. He’s a transactional fuck.” …

> In fairness to Zaslav and his bean counters, Eastwood’s movies have not been bankable in recent years or a significant part of the awards conversation since 2015, when American Sniper landed six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (on the heels of ranking as 2014’s highest-grossing North American release, taking in more than $350 million). The director’s last movie, the period western Cry Macho, starring Eastwood as an aging rodeo star tasked with traveling to Mexico to kidnap his former boss’s estranged son, was received as a flop. It grossed a mere $16.5 million, versus a $33 million production budget, though that figure comes with the COVID-era asterisk of reaching theaters when the world was shut down. In an infamous 2022 Wall Street Journal profile of Zaslav, the then–newly installed WBD mogul had grilled studio suits about why Cry Macho had been green-lit. Eastwood’s 2019 bio-drama, Richard Jewell, had sold a lackluster $44 million worth of tickets globally, and the kind of mid-budget, adult-skewing fare the director favored was becoming a dying breed at the box office. The execs said they knew Cry Macho was unlikely to make money but replied that Eastwood had given Warner many hits and never turned in anything late or overbudget. Which prompted Zaslav to reportedly quote the Jerry Maguire asshole aphorism: “It’s not show friends — it’s show business.”",214

They’ve given it a limited theatrical to allow it to qualify for Oscar so clearly they think it’s good. They just don’t think it’s commercially viable enough to justify the additional risk.",15
movies,1gkcmof,Why Did Warner Bros.

How come it was just a limited release?’ And that creates a little bit more publicity for it. Then maybe the studios will be like, ‘Oh, sorry. Please, we didn’t know it was going to be received this well.’”

I really enjoyed it, even though the story is a little contrived.  All the actors are well-known and were excellent in their roles.  There's a lot of moral ambiguity (which I love) and I can see why the studio would be hesitant for a wide release since the movie asks a lot of uncomfortable questions about personal responsibility.

*Juror #2* was financed as a MAX exclusive, WB only began on a theatrical release after seeing the final product. Btw, switching from a streaming to theatrical release often means paying back pay to union crew (as they work for lower rates on streaming deals than theatrical). So it did take a certain amount of investment to even begin a theatrical distribution strategy.

movies,1gkcmof,Why Did Warner Bros. Bury Clint Eastwood’s ‘Juror No. 2’?,"> Which prompted Zaslav to reportedly quote the Jerry Maguire asshole aphorism: “It’s not show friends — it’s show business.”

This is the kind of short-sightedness that makes him such a stupid studio head.  He's taking the absolute wrong lessons from this and refusing to consider anything but the immediate variables in front of him.

Show business is absolutely about friends.  So many movies are made only because people have connections and friendships.  Networking with other people is as important as the actual act of shooting a movie.  Keeping a big name happy is not something to be dismissed entirely.  Yes, sometimes you need to tell people ""no"", but it should never be based on immediate profit.  It should be based on long-term outlook.  Even using the Joker 2 debacle as an example, imagine if WB didn't hire Todd Phillips because of Hangover 3, then they never would have gotten Joker 1.  Imagine if James Cameron got fired and replaced after Titanic's budget ballooned into one of the most expensive films of all time, and someone like Zazlav canceled it.  

In the end, $33 million for Cry Macho is a tiny loss compared to keeping a guy around who probably isn't going to tank a lot of $200 million blockbusters and may still occasionally deliver a hit on a modest budget.  The calculation should never be ""How much is this guy's next movie going to make?"", it should take into account the overall risk using a lifetime's worth of films and connections.",40

On top of that, I think it was marketed poorly, and am waiting for studios to figure out that these subtitles are detrimental to earnings--you discourage general audiences with *Fast & Furious Presents:* Or *A Star Wars Story.* Doubly so for a property which, as you say, wasn't terribly profitable to begin with.

The big success for Dune was growth over the first installment, so they're able to consider part 3 a safe bet. 

They weren't a drag--they paid their own way--but they don't contribute significantly to the cash flow either.",2
movies,1gkcmof,Why Did Warner Bros. Bury Clint Eastwood’s ‘Juror No. 2’?,"This is mostly true. Many costs on both production and marketing ends are effectively a shell game. However, the result of this shell game is that studio executives, producers, & their overhead get paid. In your scenario, A hires B at insanely marked up prices--but then B also takes over payroll and producing fees, bonuses, even likeness and licensing fees -- basically any financial liability Company A can possibly justify as related to the movie being marketed.

That is, while the studio offsets alot of costs this way, the markup isn't really kept by them. It doesn't become cash on hand or regular ""profit"" the way an actual profitable movie may provide. It doesn't help them turn around and distribute the next movie--which is how WB has 40 billion in corporate debt--speaking of which, interest on that debt will be paid by Company B under the marketing budget. 

I'd also add a note on the net profit issue. WGA-writers-are the only major party whose residuals are part of the net. There can be some others, depending on the type of project and how bad their lawyers are. But SAG, DGA, & PGA, are part of the distributor gross, while some major stars and parties who hold IP licenses are typically able to negotiate for a share or bonuses based on the first dollar gross.

This of course doesn't even scratch the surface of Hollywood accounting practices, but since you mentioned it: Studios absolutely ensure that the net is as close to 0 as their accountants can get. But that, along with vertical integration, is more about taxes than creatives--writers are just collateral damage. Of course its something the WGA could fix, but its been part of their contract for so long that I think its just become an accepted part of the math--they prioritize other gains over meaningful residuals.",1
movies,1gkcmof,Why Did Warner Bros. Bury Clint Eastwood’s ‘Juror No. 2’?,"Not able to use their cash is kinda the definition of cash poor--certainly as a colloquial expression.

Additionally, 3.6B cash on hand & 1B annual free cash may sound rather stable by stock market standards--but it isn't by the standard of a legacy studio and the way distributors typically operate. I've addressed some of that in greater detail in other comments, but the aspect relevant here: Distributors' primary cash expenditures are (normally) interest on financed productions, marketing, and distribution. It's all expense, as opposed to converting cash to assets. They're the epitome of spending money to make money and they do so in big chunks. 

A typical wide release--forget major tentpole items--just a regular genre flick on 3000 screens is going to start at 50M. Thats a very basic ad campaign and the delivery of physical media to theater projectors. 50m thats pure expense. Lowes can build and stock three stores for that cost--and retain nearly all of that value in real estate, equipment, and unsold inventory. 

Everyone is struggling, but for WB its been a more long standing issue. Of the legacy studios, only Paramount is worse off--and half the size of WB. For Context: Paramount has 2.3B on hand. Disney, Sony, Comcast/Universal are in a different stratosphere but have 6B, 12B, & 9B respectively. Disney in particular is way down from their usual war chest of 15B.",1

However, my point was more that Barbie revenue didn't go far because of other major releases--see parent comments about cash on hand--its not issue of whether an individual release is or will be profitable on its own.  

Barbie netted 425m cash on hand--thats enough for 3 major releases. Wonka itself required 185m in marketing and distribution. In return, that 140m net only covers one subsequent (major) release.

movies,1gkajxb,‘Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery’ Guide: Everything to Know About Rian Johnson’s Latest Whodunnit,"The thing is, I’ve seen my fair share of flat, sterile, safe cinematography. But the crazy thing is no matter what big name director and cinematographer is attached to the project, with a few notable exceptions that had crazy budgets, they have this made-for-tv look that has made its way onto streaming. It’s not just that it’s uninspired, it’s that it’s consistently uninspired and monotonous so right off the bat there’s a cheap/tacky or even uncanny quality to it. No, I don’t really have anything against digital (I love film, but Fincher and Soderbergh are more than enough evidence to that digital when done well looks fine), this is purely aesthetic, not technical criticism.

Glass Onion in particular, as well as Wes Anderson’s Roald Dahl shorts were disappointing because the artistic direction, reliance on lazily dressed studio sets, and surprisingly a lot of bad CGI (even in Wes Anderson’s Henry Sugar adaptation). You’re right but this considerably basic production quality really affects my immersion too. I probably sound like a pretentious old man screaming at the clouds over nothing, but with the prevalence of streaming content in my lifetime and how much I’m exposed to it in my generation, I think there’s nothing wrong with having better standards.",1

/He did get fined for animal cruelty after the murder charges.

Either way apart from the pig, the animals killed on screen were killed by the native tribe (who featured as extras in the film). [The animals were about to be killed anyway and used for food and such](https://www.slashfilm.com/600140/the-legendary-cannibal-holocaust-controversy-explained/) (that's kind of how rural tribal life works) and Deodato wanted to catch it all on film.

I tried to provide at least somewhat legitimate sources, because there's a lot of rumors surrounding the whole production. Some to make it sound worse than it actually was in some ways, some to hide how shitty it actually was in other ways. But there was definitely a lot of fuckery going on. On top of the animal cruelty, the native tribe members got duped into appearing in the film for pennies, not really understanding what was going on and Francesca Ciardi was pressured into nude scenes against her wishes.

I actually like the film. The soundtrack is incredible, the found footage style was revolutionary at the time and all the shock in the film has a point to it (and the real violence towards animals mixed with fake violence towards people really fucks with your brain).

movies,1gl09mt,Earliest instance of a found footage film? The best one,"Every link you posted agrees with me, which is pretty funny!


Mockumentary, as pointed out in the above links, comes from “mock” and “documentary.” In this case, “mock” means “not authentic or real, but without the intention to deceive,” not “tease or laugh at in a scornful or contemptuous manner.”

Webster definition is “facetious or satirical.” Yes, it could be satirical. It could also simply be facetious. This is how definitions work. 

Wiki quote: “A mockumentary (a portmanteau of mock and documentary) is a type of film or television show depicting fictional events, but presented as a documentary.” It goes on to say “usually satirical” but this is not a requirement. 

StudioBinder definition of “mockumentary”: A mockumentary is a work of fiction that’s presented in the style of a documentary.

Some of SNL's writers wrote for National Lampoon before SNL, like the great Michaael O'Donoghue, Anne Beatts, etc. John Hughes got his start at the Lampoon, as did P.J. O'Rourke. Not did National Lampoon rip off the Harvard Lampoon - it was created by former Harvard Lampoon writers. I do think that the TV show Fridays was a deliberate rip-off of SNL.",9
movies,1gktp9l,"""Saturday Night"" - not as good as ""Futile & Stupid Gesture""","I’ve been reading the SNL oral history book since seeing Saturday Night, and according to the book, the movie portrays the relationship to Carson reruns in an inaccurate way.

movies,1gktp9l,"""Saturday Night"" - not as good as ""Futile & Stupid Gesture""","agreed. Futile and Stupid Gesture felt like a full exploration of the good and the bad of Doug Kenny and the whole comedy scene that sprung to life around him. Saturday Night, meanwhile, I think feels like it has too much reverence and awe some the legacy of the show and it's creator to really get into the deeper depths of what went into making that show. Ultimately Stupid Gesture feels more genuine where Saturday Night feels like something of a commercial for SNL's 50th year.",2
